i'm i'm more from the the product side

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,319
so

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,519
um obviously the enemy of of

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,080
of developers and and scrum masters

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
abound but um i thought i'd um spend a

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
little bit of time talking about some of

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
the experiences of

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,119
of of how we've been as a company and as

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,439
a team

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,519
kind of coping to the the current sort

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
of crisis effectively i mean i will say

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,480
that the coronavirus situation has been

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
a

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
completely unexplained crisis and it's

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,679
interesting because back back at the

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,960
beginning of the year i actually had a

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,559
a an episode where um like half my face

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
stopped working for a few weeks like

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
it's called bellsprout it's just

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
something that can happen

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
and that was for me like the worst thing

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,640
that was gonna happen that year

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
and then all of a sudden everything else

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
happened that year and it

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,960
and it's just been a complete car crash

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,760
and i'm

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,039
obviously really um i really hope that

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
every single person on this call

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
everyone that's working for the

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,760
different types of companies on this

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,920
call

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,440
are having a really know they're coming

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
out of it because it's it's

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,080
it's been horrible in many ways and um i

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,960
hope that you're all okay

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,799
um just uh kind of setting the scene a

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
little bit so you know who out who i am

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
that's the only acceptable picture of me

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
these days um

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,119
any other picture just gets older like

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,439
in a novel

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,880
um so i'm uh i had the product team at a

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,320
company called black swan data

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
so a slightly different type of company

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,960
to the other presenters tonight uh

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,280
much much smaller much newer and my own

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,360
personal background i'm a rehabilitated

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
um developer and nerd

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,840
so i've spent a lot of time in my past

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
working in analytics and um

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,079
working in operations management moving

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
into sort of full stack web development

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,520
and then into product over the years so

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
really starting to move um over the

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
years into

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,079
not just developing the stuff that we

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,280
want to to give to people but actually

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,960
starting to understand

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
why that's actually important to develop

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
and getting really interested in the

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
roadmap and

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
really trying to understand our users so

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
it's been an interesting journey and

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
i've i've worn a lot of hats in my time

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,360
but

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,799
in the kind of spirit of t-shaped people

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
i think it's been really um

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
it's been really helpful for my career

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,840
to make sure that i understand kind of

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,400
what's going on and what's important um

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,800
been at black swan data for 18 months so

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
started beginning last year

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
just now since no one's heard of black

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
swan just a brief

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
description of what we're doing so you

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,400
can understand maybe some of the

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
challenges that i'm going to be talking

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
about

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,319
i've actually got kind of three arms um

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
i work for black swan data so the

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,080
the top right and we're basically a

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,640
machine learning powered

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
ai powered uh trend analytics and

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,400
prediction platform so

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,599
we offer us uh solutions to our

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
customers which are

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
very large uh consumer goods companies

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
so people that sell stuff in shops and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
pubs and bars and restaurants and try

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
and tell them where

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
what what things they should be looking

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
at next uh what what's the big trend in

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
their category based on social

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
conversation

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,280
uh publicly available news articles and

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,159
stuff like that we also got another

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
couple of arms so

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,080
feather who do a lot of the a lot of

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
really cool stuff in in aviation and

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
white swan who i'd love to talk to you

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
about later because that's a charity

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
that we also run

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,360
uh working in the sort of healthcare

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
space and using prediction to

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
really understand how to help make

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
people

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
know what's wrong with them and how they

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,239
can get better so i will say

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,400
that it's been a really interesting time

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
um over the last year but

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
as i said we're we're really working

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
with in two kind of core verticals so

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,239
consumer goods so things that people are

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
selling in shops and planes

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,519
and i'll say that again consumer goods

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,560
and planes and i'll say it again

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,640
consumer goods and planes because

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,720
that'll be relevant in a minute

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
but i also say that by the beginning of

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
uh

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
q1 or was coming into this year we were

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,560
doing really well we would had a really

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,319
good 2019

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
with a really strong growth we're

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
growing our sas business we're growing

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
our professional services business

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
um really getting a lot of big clients

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
on board and and really knocking it out

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,239
the park

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
and we were looking to come into 2020

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,959
strong and we were looking to really

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
uh scale even further and and really get

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
it over the line

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,519
we had strong strategic alignment from

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
uh

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,280
from the top down you know we had good

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,319
company strategy we had all of our core

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
kpis

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
we had recently reshuffled we changed

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,000
our ways of working and reshuffled

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
into squads aligned around certain

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
missions so

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
you know kind of uh you know really

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
optimizing the way that we worked and we

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,000
had a really cool road map built out

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
showed all of the features that we

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,759
needed to do everything was got looking

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,199
fantastic really rosy everything was on

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
on point and then we got punched in the

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
mouth

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
now i love this quote and i don't know

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,320
if mike tyson actually said it or if

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
it's another faster horse type quote um

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
but i think it's really relevant because

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
ultimately

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
it really shows in some ways the kind of

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
the fallacy of planning

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,560
because of course any plan immediately

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,120
gets disrupted as soon as

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,560
it actually meets the outside world so

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
um yeah

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
mike tyson if you did say that it's got

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
a signature i guess you probably did but

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
thank you but obviously the the opponent

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,039
in this case was

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,560
the armageddon itself coronavirus so

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,880
it's obviously been a complete nightmare

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,639
for everyone i mean i i don't know how

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
how many people we have in this in on

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,000
this call um

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
that have been affected directly or

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,680
furloughed or their companies have been

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
having trouble but it's obviously been a

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
complete nightmare and i really feel for

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
all of the people that have been

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,759
affected but you know you don't have to

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
look on linkedin to see

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,639
some of the you know all the green

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
swooshes and stuff all the people that

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
have been laid off and

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
it's been it's been quite a bad time but

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
as a company obviously we've done

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,199
uh the best we can to really weather the

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
storm and you know we're a small company

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,000
with big clients

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
so we we need to make sure that we're

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,639
pushing in the right direction to make

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
sure that we're making the right

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
decisions

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
keep moving forward and try and just get

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,960
through it as best we can

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,600
and that's really relevant for a company

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,520
that works with

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
consumer goods companies and airlines

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,400
for most of its trade because obviously

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,840
that industry has been completely

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
trashed or both of those industries have

00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,759
been completely trashed over the last

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,280
few months

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,039
with the recession and all the problems

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
in the aviation industry

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,240
um yeah we're lucky we've got some

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,600
really good clients and we've got some

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
really good partnerships so it's not

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
like uh

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
it was a massive disaster for us but

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,919
it's obviously still a concern you you

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,440
really want to be in a situation where

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
your clients are being strong so that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
you can

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
keep you know get getting the revenue to

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
keep turning the handle and keep

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,840
delivering the features that are going

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,240
to really be giving the best

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
value to those people so definitely an

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,880
interesting time

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,280
so maintaining a roadmap that's the

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,240
first bullet point on my on my chat so

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
um

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,600
really just obviously just contrary a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
little bit on

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
on you know how we try to maintain

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
continuity so

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
i would say that one of the biggest

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,400
rules of product management

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
is um to make sure that you're almost

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
like a bastion

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
of stability you're there to kind of

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,680
stand as a wall against the

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
potential avalanche of customer

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,400
requirements and obviously

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
all of the internal requirements all the

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
feature requests and the most important

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,960
thing any product person can do in this

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
sort of situation

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
or in any sort of situation is don't

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,759
panic keep it calm

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,360
you've got it just calm it down and and

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
apply product principles to make sure

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
that you're

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
you're going through it in the right way

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
and i guess the question then would be

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,680
well what is a road map so that's

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
there's five billion medium posts about

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
roadmap and

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
what a roadmap is and what a roadmap

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
isn't you know is a roadmap a project

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
plan is it

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,319
is it a gantt chart i mean i love i love

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
the um

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,759
there's a quote from so i think it was

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,360
from uh

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
i don't know it was from someone um

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
basically saying that a gantt chart is

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
an amazing

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
wonderfully crafted graphic that

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
immediately goes out of date as soon as

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
you save it

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
it's just completely irrelevant by the

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
time you you've published it because it

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,160
immediately changes

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
you know is it just an excel sheet full

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,919
of tasks probably not

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
is a list of just the coolest sounding

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,800
stuff or the things that your

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
competitors are doing that your ceo was

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,639
interested in

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
i would say myself is it should be none

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
of those things so

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
roadmap is it's a strategic document

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
it's a document that shows

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,120
you where your team and your company

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,400
needs to go and what you

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,120
and your teams need to do to get there

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,599
so some things that were important

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
before

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
all this happened remain important today

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,479
so

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
that means you don't just sit there and

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,280
say all of a sudden

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,199
everyone's screaming everyone's hair's

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
on fire we need to immediately

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
start um just doing anything running

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
around in in random

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
directions and just trying to hope that

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
that you can just survive

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
because some things are just important

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,120
and you do still need to keep doing them

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,959
so there are things for example in our

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,560
company we we're an enterprise

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
sale we work with a lot of big companies

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,920
and uh we had a lot of features that

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,040
we'd already planned in

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,800
um things like sso which uh whilst not

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
exactly the most glamorous feature was a

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
big

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
kind of stickiness unlocked with our

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
clients so we were we really wanted to

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,200
make sure that we got that over the line

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,320
we're working a lot on um sort of new

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
use cases and

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,360
driving new opportunities for upselling

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040
and cross-selling

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
lots of sort of platform improvements

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,720
fixing technical debt

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,240
you just you can't just stop doing these

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
just because there's

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,720
a global pandemic i mean frankly that's

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
as good a reason as any but you should

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,399
still stick to your principles

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,920
but you do have to beware the sun costs

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,279
fallacy or the gamblers fallacy you

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,279
can't just sit there

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
and do it because you were working on it

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,080
because ultimately

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,519
a product roadmap a plan it's not

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
something that you just

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
sit there and break it in at the

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,000
beginning of the year it's the concrete

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
sets and you're done

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,720
it's something that you should always be

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
conscious of the fact that just because

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
you started working on something

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
doesn't mean you have to finish there's

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,760
always there's always a chance to switch

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,120
it comes on to my next point around

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
pragmatism

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
so by that what i mean is that

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,200
ultimately

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
the first rule of product and product

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,320
management is

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
your job isn't to stick to a plan so

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
much as to find your user's most

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
valuable problem

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,399
and solve it now my biggest

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
take out here would be to look exactly

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
where that apostrophe is

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,079
it's not a a user's most valuable

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,959
problem it's all of your user's most

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,480
valuable problem

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,720
or the majority of you use the most

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,320
valuable problem uh

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,480
obviously the the thing is with um

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
our users uh which i'll come to a minute

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
is that actually they're

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,839
um they're probably their biggest

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
problem all of a sudden wasn't anything

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,320
that we had on the roadmap

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
their biggest problem for all of these

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
companies that we're working with was

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
what the hell do we do now

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
with covert here you're a predictive

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
analytics company you're here to

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,360
to tell us what the future holds and

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
where we should place our money and

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
where we should place our best

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
so well that's a really important thing

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,480
so um

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,399
we obviously had to take account of that

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,440
in our in our output so

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,480
we refocused um some of our squads

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
uh at least one of our squads um around

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
um

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
trying to answer that question so using

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
some of the data that we have

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
and using some of the data scientists

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,519
that we have in the squads and really um

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,800
shuffled those around to make sure that

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
we had the right people in the right

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
place

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
to do the right research the right

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
development to actually make sure that

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,240
we were answering those questions

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,079
and it gave us lots of great advantages

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,279
it helped us to

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,200
kind of prop up the uh proposition that

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
we offer for our professional services

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
you know

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
all of the people that were getting

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,360
consulting outputs from us they were

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
desperate to know about covid and what

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,079
that meant to them and we were able to

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
provide

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,360
the consulting team with with

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
information about that and it also gave

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,600
us really valuable inputs for

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
our product for our sas platform so we

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
were able to

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,320
incorporate some of that work into our

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,399
sas platform and come over come out of

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,079
the back of it with a really strong

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,839
much improved offering which really

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
helped us to um

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
to demonstrate value and obviously

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,519
really helped us with sales

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,079
conversations as well

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
i think that actually whilst you know

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,760
respon

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,240
having to change things unexpectedly is

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,839
is kind of inconvenient at the same time

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,639
it's it's really helpful

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
when it drives actual innovation so i

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,320
don't

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
want there to be um pandemics all the

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
time

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,200
but it certainly drives things in in the

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
face of necessity

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
that's the thing i'd say is also just

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,880
from a roadmap perspective i mean

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
obviously it's not controversial to say

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
you shouldn't fall in love with it you

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,360
know you have to change it

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,880
if the most valuable problem changes

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,920
then it's definitely time to

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,880
um to change up and but do that based on

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,639
actual information

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,760
and and trying to identify the most

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
important thing to solve

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,680
um so a little bit of a pivot now into

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,959
into communication they're actually

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
touching on some of the points

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
that some of the other speakers have

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
spoken about regarding um

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
kind of communication and and culture to

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
some extent so

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,399
i feel that in many ways a product

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,920
team's one of its main jobs is playing a

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
role in communication between different

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
parts of the business i mean there's

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,959
that

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,480
stupid venn diagram with the dot in the

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,000
middle that you are here

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,160
the view stuck between all different

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
parts of the business and it's obviously

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
valid to some extent i think it's really

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
important to make sure that you're

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
facilitating those discussions and

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,760
facilitating that communication

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,519
to make sure that everyone's on board

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,120
especially in times of change

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
so you know we need to keep our users

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
informed we need to make them

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
aware of any changes to the roadmap

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,639
because whilst the roadmap should never

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
be set in stone

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,639
at the same time you need to make sure

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,880
that when the stones shift

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
that people are aware of that and you

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,079
also need to maintain alignment with

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,519
with the stakeholders with the the all

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
of our cross-functional teams all of the

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
economy yeah we've got

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,240
five squads in our uh in our company

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
working on different parts of the

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
platform

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
and you need to make sure that they're

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,200
all aligned and all pulling in the right

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,200
direction and again

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
some of the some of that kind of matches

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
up to some of the discussions that we've

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,600
been having earlier tonight

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,440
so i guess uh one of the things first of

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,959
all that we were really conscious of

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
within the company and really tried to

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,680
do well within the product team

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
is um really doubling down on the

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
communication

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
um making sure that the everyone's in

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
touch because

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,240
yeah all of a sudden we're all remote

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
and

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,920
no one can see each other anymore no one

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,800
can just have a quick chat anymore

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,440
everything's a meeting uh and and that's

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
fine

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
apart from when it's not and ultimately

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
after a while i don't know about anyone

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,440
else on this call but i started to feel

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
a bit of kind of cognitive load because

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
i'm every single time i need to talk to

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,360
anyone i've got to set up a 30-minute

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,399
zoom meeting

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
um and that's not always helpful

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,079
so we some of these things are things

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,440
we're already doing but we really tried

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
to double down on some of the

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,639
communication strategies that we'd

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,800
identified before so

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,880
um one of the things that we found quite

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,959
helpful as a team is

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,040
uh like a product stand-up and i think

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
uh that was one of the cards on the

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,800
on the board that we saw earlier like

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,199
actually having effectively a 15 minute

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
stand up every day for the product team

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
it's not really a stand-up because the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
stand-ups are

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
the stand-ups they're the they're in the

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
squads but

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,480
actually sitting there and spending the

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
time regular stock work to just sit

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
there and talk about things that are

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,160
important

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
to us as a team making sure we don't

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
have any blockers and

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,600
thankfully just having a quick chance to

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,920
have a chat has been really uh useful

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,760
we also tried to replicate the um kind

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
of warm water cooler thing i think i saw

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,480
another

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,160
card on the on the previous um uh

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,800
previous board about like trying to

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,959
replicate that more kind of potluck chat

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
and set up a discord server try to be

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
cool gamers

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,279
didn't really work everyone just left on

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
mute all the time so we turned that off

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,399
company started doing things like um

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,079
random lotteries of coffee and stuff

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,279
like that i just think that one of the

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,800
things whilst i'm

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,160
really comfortable working from home

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
from my perspective there's still so

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,399
many benefits from working in the office

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,279
and um i'm not one of these like

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
linkedin

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,000
people that just sit there saying i've

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,639
saved five thousand pounds and i'm

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
working

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
all the time and i'm never going back to

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
the office i'm fine working from home

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
but i think that sometimes

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,440
you don't you do miss that kind of

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,399
one-to-one ability to just have a spit

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,800
ball of

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
a problem and you've got to keep in

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,600
touch with your squads as well so one of

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,959
the things that we also shook up was

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,160
making sure you again we have five

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,440
squads so we

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
uh we've got a lot of people working on

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
different streams and when you're in the

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,920
office

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,279
that's fine you can kind of hear what

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,360
people are doing you can look at what

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,320
people are doing you can talk to people

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
um but again everyone's remote so we we

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
kind of shut that up and came up with

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,639
what we've uh

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
particularly called the mega demo so the

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
mega demo was basically at the end of

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
every sprint

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,880
we'll just get all of the teams to demo

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
all the same time not literally all at

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
the same time but within the same

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
meeting

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
and that really helped to drive some of

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
the communication so that all of the

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
people

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,519
working all the different parts of our

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,800
platform and our offering had a really

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
good understanding of what all the other

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,360
teams are working on

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
and obviously still going for the retros

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
and obviously because we'll maintain

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,199
daily stand-ups

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,959
and having really proactive working

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,480
sessions so that we can always like

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,240
swarm around an issue if we needed to

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,920
um keep in touch with our stakeholders i

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,000
mean i love this this picture

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
for many reasons but it also obviously

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
replicates the the product manager's

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
life in

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,399
in a nutshell um but one of the things

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,079
that we've also really tried to keep up

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,680
and really double down on is

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,240
what we call a sort of show-and-tell

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,880
session so um

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,640
myself and and the team will go out

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
every two weeks and present to all hands

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
it's a webinar we'll record it

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
share it just let everyone know what

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
we've been working on

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,559
and then what we're going to be working

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,439
on next and then like a presentation at

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,679
the end of uh

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,799
about like how the vocab is looking if

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,319
anything's changing

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,919
any other generic news that's going to

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,280
be affecting the product delivery

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,959
and i think that that's been a really

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
fantastic way of just making sure that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
the company's aligned

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,559
both with what we're currently doing and

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
how we're tracking against the company

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,280
vision

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,039
so if anyone's not doing a show-and-tell

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,919
type session as a sort of an agile or

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,000
delivery

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,679
such product team i i would definitely

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,360
recommend it to to try and drive that

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,760
uh stakeholder alignment and also yeah

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,280
this

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
game keeping in touch with our customers

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,320
so i mean obviously the customers are

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
those that pay the bills and

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
i don't know why that's a bitcoin now i

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
should have chosen different oh they're

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,840
all they're all

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,880
cryptocurrencies done it um but

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
basically

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
making sure that you're keeping it up to

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,039
customers because ultimately the product

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
cliche is that

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
um you know your customers are your most

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
important

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
uh people and of course they are they

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,919
they pay the bills they're the ones that

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,280
that you're trying to sell so making

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,880
sure as product people

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,720
you're maintaining the best practice of

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,000
talking to your customers all the time

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
having your sessions looking at your

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
customer activity and data to make sure

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
that you're

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
you're really um in line or in touch

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
with their needs because

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
i personally think any product team that

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
isn't constantly in touch either the

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
internal or external customers

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,480
users of the platform is is missing a

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,640
part of this reading

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
uh and i guess and the final point on

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
communication is just

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,160
don't be scared to uh to override it i

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
think there's a real

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,760
trend i guess to make sure to try to not

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
repeat yourself or

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,679
not to bore people and obviously i'm

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,400
failing at that at the moment but

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,160
at the same time just making sure that

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,919
that you keep everyone up to date and

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
frankly you can never say to say

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
something enough from my perspective

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
if you're not bored of hearing it

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,919
yourself you've probably not said it

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
enough times there's loads of reasons

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
why people won't

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,039
have remembered what you're saying or uh

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,919
you know have a solid idea about every

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,559
single aspect

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,000
just keep saying it keep sharing it keep

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,720
making sure that everyone's aligned and

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
on board

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
take questions when you can and just

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,799
make sure that you that you're hitting

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
the communication as much as possible

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,600
because you can't do it enough

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
and i guess the the final point is about

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
coming out strong i know i'm nearly at

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,640
time i don't want to get in trouble

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,960
um it has been a hard few months and

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,120
obviously we're still terrified of this

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
sort of second dip or second second

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,880
spike and

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
you know what's coming next and we have

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
to be

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,720
conscious of course that again lots of

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,880
companies have had trouble

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
a lot of our colleagues again you see on

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
linkedin there's the people are in

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
trouble

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
um but most importantly from all of this

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
and again i touched on this earlier is

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
just for

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,200
the kind of the concept that you really

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
just need to be able to come out

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
stronger and

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,880
use the things that you learn and the

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
improved ways of working the

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
optimizations that you had to put in

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
place to keep yourself going

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
try and use the best of those to to move

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,799
forward and and

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
you know keep servicing what you're

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
doing so

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
there's things like optimizing how we

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
work and collaborate

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,679
um someone touched on it earlier sort of

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,120
enabling uh asynchronous communicate

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
communication there's plenty of reasons

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
why

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
people aren't gonna be able to just

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
communicate in meetings all the time

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
yeah there's gonna be people that

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,480
have child care responsibilities there's

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
gonna be ebbs and flows in people's

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,559
workloads

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
i think it's just really important to

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
make sure that you lean into things like

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
slack and really double

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,320
say double down a lot but just double

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
down on on enabling that sort of thing

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,520
and also leaning into your empowered

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
team so you can't just sit there

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,200
micromanaging your teams and you

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,799
you clearly shouldn't anyway but if you

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,080
do have remote teams

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,840
making sure you give them the

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,960
information that they need to to do what

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
they need to do

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,799
set up the feedback loops so that they

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
can feed back to you and let you know if

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,640
you need to course quick

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,880
and trust your teams to to work and

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
empower them to deliver

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
and they're using smart tooling so just

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
making i saw this other thing earlier i

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,039
thought

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,120
it's cool now but i'm a big fan of

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,880
things like mirror so using platforms

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,400
like that to really replace the kind of

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,679
the whiteboarding and

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,280
allow you to collaborate much more

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,159
effectively i'm sure there are plenty of

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,120
other tools but

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,720
that's the one i use and the last last

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,280
slide for me just making sure that

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
that you're ready to go so like you know

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
again

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,320
just taking the best of what we've what

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
we've uh learned and some of the ways

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
that we've had to adapt our work and

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,919
practices

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
making sure that we're really focused on

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,799
what the customer needs and answering

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
their most important questions

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
and just um really using maybe as we

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
come out of

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
some of the hell that we've been in in

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
the last few months just

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,880
really using what we've learned to to

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,679
keep driving forward

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,679
refocus concentrate on what's important

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,400
and just go forward and just keep

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
delivering value

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,080
and that's me um if if you're not bored

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
and

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,840
i can't hear you so i'll have to presume

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,000
that you're not there's a few ways to

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,080
follow me i actually put this linkedin

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,280
thing in at the last minute um because i

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
saw it it looked cool

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,799
so i had to try and work out how to do

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,400
that very quickly um but there's a few

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
ways to contact me and obviously

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,000
if anyone is interested in finding out

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,520
about our healthcare charity i'd be

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
happy to chat about that or obviously

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,760
you can click on that link

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
and find out for yourself so thank you

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,480
very much any questions

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,120
thanks jason um yeah we we have um one

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
from

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
um parallel um so that they asked do you

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,039
think work from home

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,720
impacts innovation because you can't

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,720
have those spontaneous

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
spontaneous chats collaborations with

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
people that you would do when you're in

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,679
the office

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,799
i think it's it's obviously more

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,200
difficult

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,480
and and it is a really traditional way

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
of looking at things to sit there and

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,760
say oh well

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
let us all sit around that we work bar

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,080
you know beer taps and have a chat and

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,919
innovate and

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,400
also the ideas crackling above our head

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,240
and you know obviously

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
that is fun don't get me wrong but at

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
the same time i think that for me it's

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,880
all about that

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,120
point about sort of leaning into the um

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,000
really leaning into it so leaning into

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
tools and

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,039
ways you know one of the things i will

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
say is that we we

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,159
we're in a distributed company anyway so

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
we've got offices in

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,840
hungary we've got offices in america

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,520
sort of western east coast we've got

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,000
offices in different parts of england

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,440
so part of it was kind of natural anyway

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
we had to

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,840
we've always had to to work remotely and

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
kind of try and get that crackle across

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,720
a zoom link or

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
equivalent um i think that

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
you know to be frank maybe that was

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
something we didn't do always amazingly

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
before and one of the things that i

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,640
would say that

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
we've got out of this is kind of going

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,440
for the kind of one remote all the note

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
type uh rule which i mean it's not a law

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,039
but more of a guideline like

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
if we can sit there and make sure that

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,080
everyone's engaged that you've not got

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,159
like nine people in a room

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,159
all crackling and one person on the line

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,080
just barely hearing people

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,159
so sort of concentrating on those tools

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,840
using some really fantastic sort of

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,520
collaboration tools and kind of online

00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,559
online sharing and on online idea

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,480
optimization boards and all that stuff

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,600
is it the same as all sitting around a

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,159
table

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,440
drinking lattes and and scribbling stuff

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
down on a

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,799
on a pad probably not but at the same

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,159
time i think

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,600
as long as you lean into it and you

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
really push that kind of remote

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,679
collaboration and the remote tools then

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
there's

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,279
plenty out there to help you get that

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,919
done these days

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,640
and the next question from muhammad um

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
let's say

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
do you think more companies will adopt

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
agile

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
considering the pandemic has caused

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,440
people to adopt new ways of working

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,679
so i think that lots of companies either

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
think they are or are trying to be agile

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,559
and obviously

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,000
there's being there's doing agile

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
there's being agile there's

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
all the different types of there's

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,679
obviously lots of cliches about like

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,200
the the types of of agile

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
transformations that some especially

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
bigger companies

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,400
can um find themselves in

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,000
uh from my perspective i think that

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
agile is definitely the way that people

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,039
are going

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,640
even if it's just agile in name only

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,039
because

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,799
for me i think it's gotten it's enough

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,279
for the zeitgeist that just people

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,279
aren't gonna i don't think there's any

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,400
fans of waterfall walking

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,559
working unless it's in really regulated

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,720
industries or industries that have

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,600
really strict kind of

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,720
seasonal staff away or whether actually

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,840
it's interesting because one of our

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
some of our clients in the irrigation

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,120
industry you know you've got to get

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,440
stuff on planes that's

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
not easy to you can't just continuously

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,679
deploy it to a plane

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
so there's obviously some level of kind

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,320
of scheduling around that stuff and sort

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
of good old-fashioned

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,159
project management but i think from my

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
perspective i can't really

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,440
see that many people just sitting there

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,640
choosing waterfall as a

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,480
as a method unless it got a really

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
specialized use case but i think also

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
with regards to that question it's like

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,919
well yeah sure

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,720
the pandemic and the new ways of working

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,760
i mean you you can waterfall remotely

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
i recommend it but you can um i think

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
it's more like

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,120
do i see that people are going to be in

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,440
encouraging more kind of distributed and

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,159
working and remote collaboration i

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,840
absolutely

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
think now i think that there are a

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
number of companies already that have

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
said

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,159
well yeah you can work from home forever

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
or you can work for home for years or

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,600
whatever and i

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,320
i don't see that going away i think that

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
if this was

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
if the pandemic had been like a two-day

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
thing or something like that it would

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
have just been a blip and everything

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,159
everything would have just carried on

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,000
but i think it's lasted for long enough

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
now that um

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,919
it's going to have a sort of a seismic

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,320
shift in in attitudes and

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,760
because people have had to realize that

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
people can basically do their jobs from

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
home

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,919
unless you're literally physically

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,360
having to touch people you can basically

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,880
do your job at home and

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,960
all if you have really specialized

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
equipment but even that could be

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
replicated so i think that it's going to

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,480
be a massive trend

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,240
going forward after we come out could i

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,440
think with you for a second there jason

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,039
so um

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
my challenge to everyone on the call is

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,279
um agile roundabout but

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,640
probably we apply it when it's needed i

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,120
think that's what you're coming to right

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,440
jason

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,400
and probably been thinking with you here

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,640
is you have

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,240
waterfall you have lean you have you

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,559
have loads of different methodologies

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,399
but

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,240
um it's about when do you need this

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,919
so we're saying when an organization

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,720
needs an agile

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,600
um do i i'd actually rephrase that my

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,000
question to you is

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,799
is do organizations need to be more

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,520
responsive

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,440
and flexible to adapt to the economic

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,440
situation that

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,279
the changing demands of the customer

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,360
jason mentioned something really

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
pertinent by marty kagan as well these

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,360
books got inspired

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,279
phenomenal this guy's like the the og of

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,399
product world

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,480
they don't really care about terms and

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,799
it it it's it's a bit controversial but

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,799
all of us have learned them though we've

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,960
learned how to use and deploy them

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,600
so at the end end of the day it sounds

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,159
like jason then all of us are focused on

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,919
where does the value sit and how do we

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,159
pivot to find it

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
because day one like today it's the

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
value was in

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
coffee's actual physical coffees right

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,000
people were buying them

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,679
now it's on delivery now it's on can i

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,559
get my coffee delivered to me

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,080
so can we can we change our business and

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,080
our model to adapt to that

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,279
or can we can we flex that because if we

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
can't that's where we're seeing

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,559
retailers

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
all older organizations that haven't

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,480
been able to respond as quickly

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,600
literally pulling out of of physical

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
locations

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
and i don't think that's a trend we're

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,679
gonna we're gonna see die out we're

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
gonna see

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,039
amazon and everyone and we can see

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
through the deregulation talks in the us

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,840
right now

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,120
with the big four what's happening

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
everyone's turning around and saying

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,480
well

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,240
these guys are going to get more

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
powerful in a way it's a good thing it's

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,679
a bad thing but

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,880
jason's pertinent point is pivot to

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,360
where the customer is and that's what i

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,279
do

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,640
i advocate as well it doesn't matter

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,640
what you use

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
i've uh i've just got one final thought

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
that's okay because i feel quite

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,799
passionate about this the question being

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,399
do you think companies have adopted

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,960
agile way of working

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,120
i really believe that the generation

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,399
coming into the workforce

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,480
aren't going to want to work any other

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,880
way and the reason being agile values

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
it's

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,679
people-focused it's fast and iterative

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,120
it's about working solutions it's about

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
the customer

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,720
the millennial generation have got the

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,720
attention span of a teaspoon

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,720
most of the guys i started at vodafone

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
with and around this similar kind of

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
time you know

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,159
lots of brands leaving university the

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
majority of them left after a year

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,320
because they get bored and they want to

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
move on to the next thing

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,760
so there's no way that you're going to

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,279
be able to run projects with

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
two-year road maps where nothing

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,799
exciting happens for a long time

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
because the workforce coming through the

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
young designers developers

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,279
they'll just get bored and they'll go

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
somewhere else so i don't think

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
companies are going to have a choice

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,360
because if they want to retain the

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,840
workforce coming through

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,440
who value that speed who value that that

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
customer relationship

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,279
and who value all those things that i

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,720
think agile has at its core

00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,919
um they're going to have to i think

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,640
they're going to have to adopt agile

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,080
whether they like

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,600
all the terminologies and the frameworks

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,039
or not they're going to have to adopt

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
the agile values

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,000
instead of a number of the principles

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,799
and i was saying ben you sound like an

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
entrepreneur

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,080
the way you are we

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,840
i think we all share our dna strand here

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,320
is that we build stuff that people

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,279
we we try to build stuff people want and

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
it's hard right

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,840
it's it's really hard and you you're

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,840
right though it's um

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,840
we're seeing those the general

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,120
environment if you

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,880
you have to have that balance between

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,279
the environment and what

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,200
has to be delivered um just curious on a

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,799
second how have you

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,279
have you addressed that i know we've got

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,039
a few more minutes to chew the fat but

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,399
like i can empathize with that that's

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
one of the attraction points in the

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,919
career but have you

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
put it as a strict measure on people you

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,880
hire is it

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,159
just something do you try to almost see

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,679
the cultural fit of people when you

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,320
bring them into the organization

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,760
just thinking with you we yeah it's a

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,640
good point a lot of our

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,480
kind of hr marketing promotional stuff

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
recently has been around we're an agile

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
company which has been great

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,519
we shifted a load of our operation from

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
newbury to london

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
which again was really good at

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,440
attracting young talent in london

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,960
and if i look around whether i say i

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,559
look around the office i can't but

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,320
if i was in the office in london and i

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,360
looked around the office the majority of

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,760
people would be

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,440
fairly young and i think they're

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,720
probably staying around with us a little

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,320
bit longer than

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,159
perhaps they may do if it was a

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
different working environment so

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,279
i think it's definitely something the

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,640
business are doing and i think whether

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,159
they realize they're doing it well or

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,720
not they are doing it well

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,000
um but yeah i mean there's a reason that

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,519
lots of young people like to go and work

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,720
for startups now and you know it's not

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,159
very fashionable to go and work for a

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,600
bank it's fashionable to go and work for

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,279
monzo isn't it so

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,039
i think that's not just reflective of a

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,640
trend but it's reflective of the way of

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,000
working and it's not just beer fridges

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
and ping pong tables but

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,399
it's hot it's the autonomy it's it's the

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,960
autonomy it's the customer focus

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,919
it's the attitude and i think the kind

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,679
of the respect

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,440
between the guys at the top and the guys

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,399
doing the work and i think that all

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
stems from

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,640
agile valleys yeah i like the thing that

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,159
you just said is

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,399
there's not much middle fat right so um

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,760
but one thing i i was reading jeff

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,760
bezos's first

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,440
um letter to shareholders i got told

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,279
about reading these recently

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,600
um but he said something in that that

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,679
probably hits home which is

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,880
when he's looking for people he said i

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,480
want people that

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,039
basically work hard work smart

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,320
and work long hours he said if you're

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,960
meeting only two of those

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,200
this isn't a place for you but i think i

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,840
think that's the balance right is

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,679
it is an intense environment though if

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,519
you get in there and you do this right

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,120
and you try and churn out products fast

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,279
that succeed

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,799
but it doesn't mean it can't be fun i

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,519
think that's what you're alluding to

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,039
it can be intense at moments but make

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,679
sure that we keep it attractive

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,360
otherwise

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
we it's going to be us sitting in a room

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,080
going with loads of post-it notes what

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,240
went on

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
but it should be really exciting to make

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,279
cool stuff right

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,880
i mean that's the whole point and even

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,720
though even old people like me like

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,720
working at startups because it's

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,919
it's like the energy and the urgency of

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,960
making this stuff and

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,440
you obviously waterfall and urgency

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,799
uh very you know they don't really match

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,000
together that well because of the sort

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,440
of more extended timelines

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,760
but i think that the critical point of

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,799
all of that is you i think you kind of

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,799
touched it as well like

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,159
your customer doesn't care how you made

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,919
it

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,200
so for us you know we we've got loads of

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,200
machine learning and ai

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,039
and cool buzzwords sort of powering a

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,880
lot of our prediction technology

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,640
but frankly if we could offer the same

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,760
stuff supported by

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,279
5 000 people filling in manually the

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,799
customers would buy it just the same as

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,320
long as it was the same price

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,600
and it's the same with methodologies you

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,679
know people shouldn't care whether

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,640
you're lean or your scrum or your kanban

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,200
or your

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
extreme this or you're on fire that you

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
know it's good it's good to have a tool

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
kit right

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,120
it's good to have a it's important it's

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,200
fundamental to have a toolkit

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,640
based on where your products at but it's

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,960
um it is

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,559
it is the application you know like um a

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,519
kung fu master or someone who's great at

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,919
jiu-jitsu

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,520
and stand up muay thai they know how to

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,679
deploy this at the right time

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,720
and it's the same thing with this is you

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,000
got to spend you

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,240
it was really interesting how the

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,520
t-shape talk because if you take time to

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,960
actually learn these things and the

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,800
thing is it does just take time and

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,720
experience

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,720
then you can deploy at the right time

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,639
and then you can find a new situation

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,320
especially right now and this is one

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,280
thing i think jason and ben really

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,119
emphasized

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,879
is regard this is a challenging

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,480
situation it's going to test

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,800
practitioners

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,760
and look at this contrast though i was

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,760
just thinking about this

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,599
we're talking about do we need agile

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,679
practitioners but then look at how many

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,320
people are on the market right now

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,119
right there's possibly a contrast going

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,440
on

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,560
if you needed it that heavily why are

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,560
there so many so my

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,879
my question to you is look at what do

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
you need is it lean do you just need

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,920
people who can drive good product

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,280
behaviors and then

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,760
if you're in a situation trying to find

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,760
a job adapt yourself or upskill

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,839
and maybe jason ben if you have any good

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,480
resources specifically that event

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,760
that avengers website as well was it's i

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
wish i had something like that when i

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,359
started out

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,800
it was old school like it was the the

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,560
pdfs that you had

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
written down and then you spoke to

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,680
friends until you got some and you made

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,160
up some tools and techniques

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,880
but that's that's gold and then jason as

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
well if

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,040
you have any recommended material maybe

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,400
just add you guys on linkedin

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,960
