hi everybody I am prospectively were the

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,849
co-founder and lead engineer today it is

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,920
a startup based in Lagos Nigeria

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,509
that provides from services from engines

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,449
just you know really aim to improve the

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,009
quality of nature in general and now

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,390
we're talking about media performance at

00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:26,189
scale so that it so let's look at some

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,559
statistics from smart insights it's calm

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,960
you can see like the total population of

00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,090
people as I get the total number of

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,440
Internet users even here if you look at

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,079
the social media use around the world

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,699
you can also see the total number of you

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,730
know people using their mobile phones to

00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:44,280
access social media and access the

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,050
Internet I wanted to just keep this in

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,870
mind because it's going to be useful as

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,940
we just you know keep talking about

00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,890
media performance so let's look at the

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,769
world most used social platforms

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,809
Facebook YouTube what's up every

00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:02,120
messenger Instagram tick-tock so this

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,820
should give you a general idea of how

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,560
people interact with media files across

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,110
the internet like people say people

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,750
pretty lot of YouTube videos people send

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,939
files media files all over Instagram

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,520
tick tock is the new sensation you know

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,530
people say a little is up you know over

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,890
wire onto top people saying videos are

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,340
free people you know put videos on the

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,610
internet

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,560
funny videos videos that teach people

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,780
how to do things and something it's not

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,030
just on Twitter so this just give you an

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,170
idea a lot of media files electrons for

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,020
across the Internet ragnar way not a

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,759
pandemic era and a lot of things of

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,219
commonly know people that used to do

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,820
work physically now to submit is

00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,289
everyday people video call your parents

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,079
people video call your loved ones all

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:53,969
the time so is literally a 1000 X

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
increase in the media files that share

00:01:53,969 --> 00:02:00,210
across the internet and this is a cause

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,329
for concern because all these platforms

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,320
zoom snapshots Instagram YouTube house

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,009
party

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,460
tick-tock FaceTime billions of media

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,830
files you know video streams images

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,290
different types of facts

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,500
so you can imagine it can give you an

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,530
idea of how like all these media

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,700
opposites kill literally hundred hundred

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,100
performance you know how many

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,530
performance on their servers and hundred

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,520
performance on the client which is the

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,500
face that user is easy so what I need

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,670
you to know is that when you are talking

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,560
about media performance when your

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,270
performance is user experience with the

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
performance optimization the performance

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,850
is speed media performance is also

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
accessibility and when you can admit

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,240
your portilex for performance in a

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,670
general way Bob especially the modern

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,770
way Bob you talk about JavaScript CSS

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,940
fonts on media files but today we'll be

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,340
talking about JavaScript because doesn't

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,500
an entire talk on its own we are just

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,290
going to focus on media performance

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,110
right how do you take care of images

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,580
your videos your gives on your web app

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,620
in a way that prevents the affair

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,490
intuitive and fast loading experience

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,710
for the user

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,690
these are some of the major bottlenecks

00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,760
for media performance you know like

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,650
images load in terms of images or tones

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,260
inconsistency in the video formats like

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,570
video files plotter disregard for users

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,890
have your network inefficient in your

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,690
video caching and also failure to

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:29,390
measure video performance so this is

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,370
this way about see right now is how

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,480
customers painfully experience some of

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,820
these products yeah so a customer lose

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,530
your way Bob or cosmology up and it's

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,660
trying to just like go to all your

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,670
images and videos and yeah either

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,550
waiting for the images to load or for

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:50,660
some reasons the video above us every

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:53,270
five minutes I'm thankful that in things

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,950
twenty this is not like experience for a

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,560
lot of people but you know a couple of

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,780
years ago this was pretty common and

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,180
then you have to have like a very strong

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,220
no internet connectivity for you to

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,840
enjoy whatever you're watching you just

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,880
download you don't even on watch it

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,800
later

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,030
yeah your users are really suffering so

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,980
we are going to talk about some

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,040
techniques and tips that you can use to

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,630
me to get all of these it's crazy but it

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,700
doesn't have to be so how do you scale

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,729
media performance in you nubs seems to

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,070
consider number one leverage CDN for

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,639
globally

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,949
okay so what you should not do is some

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,240
images from me of your supper you know

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,500
you have you you should have two factors

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,660
of summer for everything you did on this

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,419
server you're you're you're ready suffer

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,190
for caching and then your fare server so

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,979
you do not have to push these files and

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,270
your images and reduces yourself just

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,760
put it on the CDN I mean good thing

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,100
about CTS is that the cache of files so

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,590
if you user as requested if far before

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,210
the clients if these I start to request

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,570
a file again it just have the cached

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,870
copy

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm a CDN like Lebanon has what you call

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,669
Dumont CDN strategy which means for your

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,229
users you know spread across different

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,360
parts of the world for example from

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,650
trends accessify from Lagos it serves

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,139
the fowl cruza

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,240
3d edge when I'm in closer to the edge I

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,810
mean it looks for a server that is

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,370
closer to me illegals and just soft VFL

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,990
to me right if somebody's in San

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,699
Francisco I literally suffered as

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,220
Cruiser to depressing in summer screens

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:25,479
years and such that file so this in

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,370
essence mix fowl retriever very fast so

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,700
your images I downloaded and apply it

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,630
very fast it videos be very fast you can

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:40,229
also use Tombo Tombo is a cooper sauce

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:42,849
CD and I can host yourself if number to

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,889
ensure you always compress your flowers

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:47,500
you know one thing I see a lot is people

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,630
upload files and then the platform's do

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,810
not compress you know as much as

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,150
possible or I look at media news sites

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,979
you know when when an editor is you know

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,630
writing something the attractive foul

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,349
just fans are not compressed so you see

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,970
if I left 2 MB 10 MB 15 MB just success

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,289
across infinite why do you have to do

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,180
that you do not go do that I mean look

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,610
at this two images for example the first

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,470
image by the left is 2 MB uncompressed

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,270
look at immediately rates narrating

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,960
kilobyte now if you look at these two

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,789
images

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,639
you cannot spot the difference they look

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:21,220
the same so what does this say about

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,380
compression if you compress get a lot of

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,720
bites you literally save the users you

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,520
you save your users

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,050
you shave off a little bite so that your

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,950
users can download affair faster and

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,659
also your users can save data very very

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,500
important so always compress your image

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,060
file

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,560
and what are the tools you can use for

00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,930
image file compression you can use it

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,730
image me this is a J's conference so I

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,990
think what are talking about putting all

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,850
the other tools that you can use for

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,650
image mean is an MP MOT that you can use

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,420
to compress your files you can also use

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,850
plugin air traveler it also does this

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,620
stuff the real leg is very amazing if

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,720
you're not trying to use the SDK you can

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,790
just do this only flight so the yard are

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,600
retrieves image just put in what you

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,880
call qo2

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,560
he want to automatically compresses the

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,660
files on the server so that by the time

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,720
the user is accessing define on the

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,670
clients it is compressed by default

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,080
number three no molest is it loading

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,640
your images if you look at Instagram

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,190
when you left you can see when you screw

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,720
the images do not appear at once some

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,600
images appear and then when you screw to

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,640
the end of the field then there is an

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,520
asset of content that is being proposed

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,660
so that's you know you can just have a

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,310
seamless experience

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,090
so what you should do in your apps is

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,919
not only what you just refuse see fast

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,690
and easy all the rest

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,060
now some of the tools you can use before

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,770
now we didn't have this attribute but

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,220
now we have a native loading these

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,200
attributes functionality on your process

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,210
and from from seven to six you can stay

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,560
in it and if you do not if you are

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,050
trying to accommodate this for all your

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,520
users you can easily view a poly few

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,300
learning attribute pull if you ensure

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,890
you have this folder process process you

00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,780
can also use this light please the user

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,540
library

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,910
here's catenary J's SDK and all you need

00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,460
to do just assign a loading attribute

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,130
which is lazy funny images and boom

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,960
takes care of it for you you can also do

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,910
that for videos in fact you should do

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,400
that way videos for the videos for the

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,320
off-screen videos obvious moon is Luton

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,150
so that they don't just appear as ones

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,190
because the user is not trying to watch

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,169
it at the same at at the time they come

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,169
to your site they are at the top so if

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,450
the videos come on the needs you do not

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,370
have to load those videos first let the

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,610
user gets to the you know to the end of

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,820
the food before you load this videos so

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,469
please desi lose everything

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,839
also do not image the size only browser

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,880
I honestly don't I see folks use CSS to

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,390
adjust the size of images umbrellas now

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,300
for the user this these are the

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,149
fulfilling if indeed is that

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,360
amazing but what is happening on that

00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,580
scene is that the lat foul the high

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,740
quality file under you know high

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,140
resolution file is Tommy little ready to

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,700
the browser so if ready we said to Jesus

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,680
that's a by the region he original signs

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,480
and then nya using CSS to no sighs no

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,610
all of that should be done only server

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,579
the resizing should be done on the CDN

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,390
so that it just fits the exact size that

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:18,880
is needed for the user don't have images

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,910
with CSS please do not this is this is

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,329
pretty common if you go to five in ten

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,490
websites cities image display note but

00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:29,920
then this is just ice tactics because on

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,930
the websites you don't see the image but

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,490
if you go to chrome dev tools and see

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,110
the image does believe it as me trying

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,390
to been downloaded image was nominate

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,720
already from the sava is using CSS to

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,060
hanged

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,740
so what are you accomplishing really it

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,990
just aesthetics these are kind of seeds

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,000
but then the image file was tearing down

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,839
we did that we said you just that so

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,750
please do not item et successes another

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,290
thing that our theis you to do is I know

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:59,140
you love your pages oh my goodness PNG

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,570
is a very quality flower it's also

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,220
provides transparency the image is a

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:09,220
shock please do well to use web P file

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,140
formats web P&G pages in you know in

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,450
case of PNG you probably don't need a

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,920
plain G file on the new site you

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,160
probably don't need a pretty firm on

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,220
that app you don't need it because JP

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,170
G's can literally give you the same you

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,810
know good quality that is closer to the

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,670
PNG so you ship of these bytes I'm

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,550
giving you such a good experience whilst

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,010
is saving their data because with web P

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,529
where P is a traffic but that gives you

00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,270
could call it c+ l smaller cells and if

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,310
you look at the case study here you to

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,560
switch to repeat on News and they got

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,230
10% faster pollutant to the dissenting

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,300
and discovered the site became 25%

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,029
faster people could Facebook you know

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,820
easier I mean in in less time than

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,290
before and it also it uses deter

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,160
consumption less less and less no forget

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,589
that so please try to ease VP under one

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,760
of the ways you can do this is right now

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,220
Europe we already probably drinking man

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,810
combustion I have to do you probably

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,280
have to set up your pure security after

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,260
they come up with you who would eat that

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,780
converts these files will extraordinary

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,610
you do not have to trainer has a feature

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,800
called f4 to immediate adamant about

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,100
Kyoto that reduces the quality of the

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,230
file F word to automatically fetch is

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,140
the most optimal and efficient format

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,420
for the file that is very Tripoli client

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,550
so this what happens you have the URL

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,580
for the image it really puts the fo2 as

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,860
you can see in on this line it's looks

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,150
at the user's browser and also looks at

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,850
the strength of the dust planet

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,440
connectivity to the tummy detect the

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,140
most efficient format to serve the user

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,080
so it doesn't matter if the file was

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,850
already in PNG or jpg or whatever as

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,390
long as it's serving it on the client

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,640
it's such an optimal format so if you

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,430
think Ruby to serve a web P which is

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,660
Internet Explorer it serves a JPEG XR

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:02,960
format and what you can do is if you try

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,880
to try to save on do you want to try to

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,430
save a file you discover that the foul

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,140
from asturias in originally it's not the

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,830
same file format that tries to sit in a

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,930
way because even though you put PNG

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:16,760
credibly say yeah a screen but then does

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,110
not know really efficient for this user

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,180
so we're just going to select a sweater

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:27,320
II which is which is totally amazing of

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:29,120
Mercedes sprites

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,130
you know there is a popular saying that

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,320
a picture is worth a thousand words and

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,000
I said it and I just wanted to see it

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,190
CSS image spreads is what the postman

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,160
images are a very good example of this

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,720
is the opening a sidebar you side by

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,180
your components that you lose a lot of

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,220
icons or loads may be like completely

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,830
loops we do not have to lose several

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,600
company logos you can literally do an

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,760
image file an image file that contains

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,770
all these images it is called is frets

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,300
so it's an image sprites you have an

00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,880
image further contains about ten images

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,640
I have my CSS file that helps you to use

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,770
them so create a CSS image sprites

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,360
instead of using several multiple images

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,150
it's just a lot of bad for you

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,370
another of the ways you can easily

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,960
produce this you can use a chopped our

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,180
CSS price generator if you google these

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,329
new cities when you go to FK and as a

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,709
motocross spreads

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,319
that you can just use to you know

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:21,360
comfort this first one fanfare all of

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:22,680
these on prevent assesses cleaner also

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,379
automatically does is for you on the

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,670
five on only flight if you put a lot of

00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,339
files to traveler

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,470
I tagged in for example I'll pretend

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,110
fattening talk they would prosper once I

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,329
just write this Uranus's slash spread

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,249
slash prosperous PNG grant all those

00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,779
files create an image bright and also

00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,279
the most an engineer is a CSS for me so

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,309
all I need to do just introduce ESS in

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,199
my in my web app and boom I have an

00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,389
image file that contains a lot of other

00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:52,129
similar images very good for performance

00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:54,509
and nothing now you should do is also

00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,079
respect the users happy this is very

00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,930
important

00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,009
these are trust see you alright and when

00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,870
your respective eases happy

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,860
you can also be afraid that's a very

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,600
good examples when you see on the screen

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,519
you can change these as much whenever

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,170
say hey this guy's battery or this

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,809
woman's battery level is very low

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,360
go ahead Asaf high quality low quality

00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:14,459
images but if the battery is very high

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,470
the batteries Chucky self high quality

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,300
images and nothing that you can also do

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,949
is to preload your video for video

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,749
performance with the batteries I just

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,870
produce the video so that the user can

00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:26,129
get a very nice experience also check

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,639
the users network connection

00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:31,399
Iza you know connected to Wi-Fi or using

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,429
the normal cellular

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:37,199
display let's just so many things that

00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,259
you can do with this but just give me an

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,550
idea of where you can try out your knobs

00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:43,920
another thing that you should do is set

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,779
of performance budget for images oh my

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,249
goodness it's very very important

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,170
I guess money talks about is a lot

00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:52,319
especially for JavaScript and one thing

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,120
that you can use for your teammates so

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,009
that all of you can be puffing on salvia

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,259
is set up performance budget say hey

00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:00,779
only the images on our platform should

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:04,970
not mine get when they are rendered on

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:07,079
the client should not be more than 2 MB

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,490
so of course you have put in good

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,769
scripts in place that compresses all of

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,389
that but no compression can be very

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:13,529
funny sometimes it compresses but lots

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,480
of compressing up so that goes into the

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,730
quality but it's performance but yet all

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,589
of you on your team come we can't get

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,209
officials on the will away when there is

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,309
an image a group of images that I

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:25,199
exceeding the six amount of bytes that

00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:27,029
you put for it a very good example of

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,020
the app that you can use to measure this

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,970
is the caliber

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,839
you can set it up and then you're good

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,820
to go gives gives a very popular

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,010
internet we use gives on sweets I use

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,620
everywhere else to express our opinions

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,020
look at this - look at this gif right

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,550
now this gift is telling me only left I

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,100
converted it to a video on boom which

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,630
opened for empty this is an mp4 video so

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,089
you can imagine ten of these gifs on

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,520
your web app the user is rendering 10

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,610
gives 10 times 10 does hundred limit but

00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,089
Liu cuts - when I change it to an mp4 it

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,399
literally Neal gave me more than 50%

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:04,440
reduction in the size of the fat now

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,930
this is irony because of you gives any

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,610
previous slides but then when you when

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:13,740
you are sending this to the user the

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:16,050
client needs to save data for the user

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,180
ok so instead of sending news maybe you

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,820
can't consider converting it to mp4 to

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,690
provide a very good experience and also

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,940
make it look fast

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,339
I see the users data they are very

00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,589
expensive so try and convert a gift to

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,209
videos I'm nothing you can do it you

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,040
know I didn't put it code for this but I

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,750
talked about pre-loading always preload

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,850
your videos ok if you user is not going

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,380
to see that again immediately please ask

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,440
me to do something else credit your

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,750
video so that when attendees a guest -

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,260
loading the video there is no buffering

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,440
it is already like you know lucky it's a

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,450
really loading the video very quickly so

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,459
another thing you should do is for your

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,670
videos and should I have video players

00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:59,190
employer adapt to the Christian adaptive

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,680
bitrate streaming is in delivery

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,180
technique the make sure your video

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,550
starts faster with fewer buffering

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,010
interruptions what happens is this there

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,290
is there is a master playlist file that

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,640
comes with your video files it depends

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,380
on it that comes the video player

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,870
dependent auto video player you see and

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,449
what that does is it contains metadata

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,699
about sub in different video strips and

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,280
what does video strands contain the

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,050
contain like you know information

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,970
different types of file with different

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,950
types of resolutions and what this does

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,460
is you have all these different types of

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:34,830
5 quality resolution so that based on

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,590
the user's internet connectivity it can

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,170
start loading the video with a low

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,660
quality video and then

00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,190
once it sees that the user CP is nice

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,570
with delays or users internet

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,460
connectivity is better not it just

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,840
switches to a high quality for you but

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,550
because you already have it's a data but

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,200
all these quality all these different

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,970
video files it's easy for you to switch

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,430
it from you know quality streaming video

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,810
to a high quality video and some of the

00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,970
players have seen that improved is by

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,340
default with the Chaka ooga chaka is an

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,020
open source it's only trophies on open

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,490
source video player I can check out you

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,940
can also check out the club nari video

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,380
player they are very good for the HLS

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,570
and epic - adaptive bitrate streaming

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,740
and if you use these for video files we

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,500
ensure that your videos are being played

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,740
faster on the media after yourself your

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,620
users as ideas money we see improving

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,810
performance is a joining small changes

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,570
can often Lee so begins

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,880
so one thing you should take away from

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,950
this talk is a remember known as here

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
ensuring that you put all these tips and

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,810
tricks in two places

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,910
always measure optimize a monitor and

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,920
some of the tools I use very good tool I

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,340
use the whip speed test from trade Mary

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,470
it doesn't meet analysis of already the

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,720
images on my website on my up this is

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,610
our Eden left let's come for example we

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,520
have a Pisco of which which is pretty

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,950
excellent rate and then if we scroll and

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,330
I scroll through like you know all the

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,820
images that it's checked on your

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:06,150
websites it gives every image an image

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,370
score also checks the size of the image

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,410
and also of us room for improvement

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,690
that's not really fantastic right and

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,820
then I can see hey this file is true

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,050
it's too large this is Nauti right

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,790
format I should be serving and I can

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,720
just pick all these recommendations in

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:23,490
to note these recommendations and then

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,710
just fix it and then go ahead and they

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,330
test it again to ensure that it is it is

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,890
very fast or that's use that you can

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,680
also use this you can you stick with

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,870
PageSpeed insights speed called the

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,360
lighthouse matrix dot-com and then it

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,880
gives you enough statistical analysis

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,030
about all the images on your website and

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,890
allows you to optimize and go ahead and

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,810
measure in and the more you measure the

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,990
more you're sure that you can even use

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,240
us very optimal experience so words to

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,360
the end of my presentation today thank

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,150
you very much and I hope they

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,070
you know put some of these things into

00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,330
work in your next video project or you

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,220
can look at the existing website and say

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,540
hey based on your combinations prosper

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,980
said right now I am going to put these

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,420
things and I'm not just going to treat

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,400
now I'm just going to keep doing it you

find me everywhere on internet when you

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:24,950
could develop are on github on Instagram

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:27,309
on medium and on tutor so thank you very

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,309
