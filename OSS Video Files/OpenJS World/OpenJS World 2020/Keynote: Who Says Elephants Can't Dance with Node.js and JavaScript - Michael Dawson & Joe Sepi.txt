hey Michael hey how you doing good how

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,230
are you good thanks for coming over

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,030
yeah thank you for inviting me over the

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,039
the tea is delicious

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,930
yeah I always like to sit down and have

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,350
a nice cup of tea yeah it's very

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,930
pleasant I feel like we're forgetting

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,000
something though what what would that be

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,880
I mean where else could we need to be

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,690
right now something happening right now

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:38,790
oh it's the open jazz world okay no oh

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,820
geez you're right we're supposed to be

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,120
on blood stage we're doing a keynote we

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,950
better get crackin on that okay let's

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,629
head over there right now okay

00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,840
so I guess before we get started we

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:59,309
should probably introduce ourselves sure

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,989
um I'll go first I'm Joseph II I worked

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,430
for IBM as an open source engineer and

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,860
the great thing is that's a lot of the

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,250
work that I do is in the community and

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,090
the nodejs project and with the open

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,430
sound Asian and I'm Michael Dawson IBM's

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,869
community lead for nodejs that means I

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,460
get to spend like Joe a lot of time

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,189
working out with the community but also

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,549
working with our internal teams who are

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,939
you know building tools to help you

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,380
deploy efficiently with nodejs teams

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,590
that are deploying you know making

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,570
large-scale nodejs deployments and just

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,869
you know supporting our customers and

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,439
internal teams who are using nodejs so

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,390
today Michael yeah who says elephants

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
can't dance with nodejs and JavaScript

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,850
Michael well you know I sometimes hear

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,100
that people think iBM is a big big

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,159
company with like a lot of history and

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,680
you know has a hard time sort of

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,439
changing ship or or getting into some of

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,130
the new technologies yeah a hard time so

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,220
what's the challenge really you know the

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,810
challenge is is that you know sometimes

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,270
that perception gets in the way of

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:18,330
people engaging

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:19,980
and it's a sec sorry there we go

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,360
got the challenge sometimes you know it

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,190
gets that perception gets in the way of

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,650
people engaging and it's really a missed

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,810
opportunity because you know iBM is

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,900
doing a lot of things in the node in

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,510
JavaScript front in the community you

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,920
know internally and I think you know if

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,510
people really knew all the things that

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,280
we're doing that that perception that

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,000
perception wouldn't really have stuck

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,650
around for quite as long as it has I

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,240
agree I think of all I think of it as

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,190
like a big ship you know it takes a

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,400
little while to turn a big ship but big

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,160
ships do turn and you know IBM isn't

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,860
great at Tooting its own horn but we

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,710
really do a lot in the nodejs space for

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,660
sure yeah so I think if you look at you

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,970
know the reality of what happens is you

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,970
know iBM is really very active in the

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,120
open-source communities you know in the

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,060
nodejs project the open J's foundation

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,190
work in the CPC we've done a lot of work

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,130
in terms of making sure that note runs

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,500
on IBM platforms as I mentioned we use

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,190
node and some very large applications

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,080
internally or building great places for

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,510
you to deploy your node.js applications

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,380
and even working on tooling that you

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,760
know when you're doing your initial

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,760
development that will help you be more

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,290
efficient and help you make sure that

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,550
when your application does get to

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,800
production it's it's going to be

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,810
successful and then finally we you know

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,690
we spend a lot of time working with our

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,640
customers both internal and external you

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,500
know we have whole groups like the IBM

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,490
cloud garage that are that are oriented

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,740
towards helping customers come and use

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,900
new technology and solve new problems so

00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,750
really you know we're we're involved in

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,880
all those different areas I think this

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,190
isn't just no js' as well you know this

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,160
is a variety of open-source tools IBM

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,870
really builds on open-source and has

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,680
been involved in open source for for

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,810
many years you know no js' but also

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,750
containers we have a lot of work that we

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,239
do in that space as well really deeply

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,669
involved in open source yeah I know very

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,380
actively involved in CNC F and you know

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,150
I think we were one of the earlier

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,680
contributors to even the Linux

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,710
Foundation so it's been a really

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,180
long-standing long-standing contribution

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,610
involvement and I think it's just that

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,009
perception of you know a company that's

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,080
been around a long time that is maybe

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,199
slowing down you know people understand

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,820
people seeing the the way that IBM is

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,780
acting here so one of the things we

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,389
meant we talked about was the

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,770
open-source contribution so maybe you

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,509
know we should talk a little bit about

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,880
the open J's foundation I know you're

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,410
acting as the chair and it would be good

00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,780
to know a little bit more what's going

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:02,910
on there yeah sure so ibm's been deeply

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,810
involved in the open JS foundation we

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,930
had a number of folks play a role in the

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,570
merger of the node.js foundation and the

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,550
jas foundation and we were you know

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,360
involved in both of those foundations

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,460
before the merger i'm the chair of the

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,770
cross project council we have a couple

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,509
other members and the cross project

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,410
council that our IBM ours

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,580
including michael and the couple others

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,110
but in addition to that we have a number

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,099
of projects that were we're very

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,220
involved in as part of the foundation

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:42,030
including nodejs of course but also node

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:45,539
read the creator of node red is Nick

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,430
O'Leary he's on my team as well and also

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,180
Chris Hiller who is the lead maintainer

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,130
for mocha is on same team

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,070
so we talked pretty regularly and the

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,560
ability to to advance the work of the

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,659
foundation through the cross project

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Council as well as the board and I know

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:05,159
you're on the board Michael so I'll turn

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,050
it over you yeah I mean really I see our

00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:09,449
involvement is like grass roots in the

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,070
projects like you said to working on the

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,750
cross project Council to help with the

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,820
governance and help bring new projects

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,610
in but we're also involved in the board

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,740
Todd Moore has been the chair of the

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,680
board for for a while and he's been a

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,050
really big supporter of nodejs as well

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,780
this year I also had the opportunity and

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,490
privilege to serve as the nodejs board

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,740
representative for on behalf of the

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,270
node.js project and you know so I've

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,099
been able to be involved and and

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,219
contribute at that level as well which

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,630
is great you know so overall you know I

00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,940
think the open J's foundation

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,530
is really important because it's the

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,600
place where we hope people will come

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,770
together to collaborate on JavaScript

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,420
and and nodejs and to sort of give it

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,520
give a place where people can come and

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,350
do that along those lines like one of

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,240
the things I'm excited about is you know

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,610
I've made a proposal for collaboration

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,860
spaces and the concept there is to

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,350
provide a place for people to come

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,150
together and collaborate under the open

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:11,490
J's Foundation getting support with

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:14,220
things like you know github repos use of

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,540
our slack channels and zooms and all

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,560
those things those small things which

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,840
can actually make a pretty big

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,820
difference without having to be a

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,950
project so you know kedai the the

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,070
foundation already supports projects but

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,660
this would let you know non projects you

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,460
know have a people come together to

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,230
collaborate on areas under the

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,150
foundation that are not necessarily tied

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,580
to specific projects so for example if

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,980
people have an interest on security they

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,180
could come together and work on things

00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,840
that are important to JavaScript

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,640
security in a collaboration space yeah

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,530
infrastructure there are a variety of

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,290
places that I think could be great

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,120
collaboration spaces yep and and

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,310
hopefully the end result is more people

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,950
getting involved and coming out to

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,310
participate yeah so what

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,110
what kind of while work are we doing

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,160
within IBM sort of around some of those

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:07,770
spaces that uh so one of the big ones is

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,390
is the nodejs community of course you

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,370
mentioned some other projects in the CPC

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,370
but no js' is is one where we were

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,840
significantly involved and dude or you

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,790
know a long history of working with

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,960
enterprise customers our focus is often

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,490
on enterprise type requirements we were

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,490
involved from the very beginning in

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,310
terms of putting together the LTS

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,440
release process to support stable and

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,200
predictable releases we now know that

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,620
we're gonna get you know a new current

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,090
every April and October and that in

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,400
October that you know the previous

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,590
current from April is going to become an

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,050
LTS release so we know that you know we

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,580
have that predictability as well as we

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,360
know that we have you know thirty months

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,900
of support

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,040
once the release goes LTS

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,650
diagnostics is another one that you know

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,180
we're very active in that's important to

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,350
be able to support our customers when

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,570
you're in production you want to have

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,950
the best tools available note being a

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,420
little bit of a younger language still

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,770
has some some work to be done on that

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,870
front so that's one of the areas that

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,660
you know we're definitely active in and

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,900
working in Gerry spoon atoll is helping

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,850
to lead an effort there on putting

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,410
together some best practices and you

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,420
know then taking those best practices

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,690
and making sure we have good tools in

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,100
the node ecosystem to support them

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,350
security is obviously one that's always

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,640
important to people and you know we've

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,650
been involved in the security working

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,790
group helping to define things like the

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,590
security processes and helping to manage

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,820
the security releases there's a lot of

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,290
work just pulling together all the

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,790
different pieces of the puzzle to get

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,010
one of those releases out so we've been

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,530
pretty active there performance is of

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,820
course important because everybody wants

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,850
to get the most out of heart their

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,940
hardware that they're buying we have

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,710
some you know as I mentioned the OBM has

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,960
some large enterprise customers and and

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,490
many times those those customers run in

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,070
in a number of different languages and

00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,790
number different countries so

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,930
internationalization is important so

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,850
that's an area that we've been involved

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,260
in as well and then finally it's just

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,660
important that we have good quality

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,810
releases so we we help with the code

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,600
quality efforts things like the code

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,440
coverage site other aspects of the

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,350
safety net like Sid Jim was originally

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,910
contributed by an IBM er and just

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,260
generally doing you know helping out

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,470
with the infrastructure to make all that

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:29,040
stuff good yeah yeah we have a number of

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,560
collaborators in the know Jeff platform

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,090
as well right yeah I think it's a

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,710
recognition of you know how much we

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,570
contribute that we have 10 core

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,970
collaborators people who can review and

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,010
land commits as well as three people on

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,800
the technical steering committee who you

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,660
know help to figure out the the edge

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,250
cases where the collaborators can't come

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,840
to an agreement on their own and it's

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,460
it's great that we can be you know

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,400
contributing and helping to lead on on

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,090
that front and you mentioned releases

00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,450
earlier I know Beth of manages the

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,500
releases for the platform isn't she if

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,640
she's going to be interviewed by the

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,860
foundation for this event yeah

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,780
there should be like a featured article

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,700
on her so if you're interested you can

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,310
you can go check that out for sure and

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,350
then she has a talk I believe it's well

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,480
right yeah her talk she's talking about

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,060
some great work that's being done in the

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,820
package maintenance working group along

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,850
the lines of you know helping maintain

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,380
errs to be able to test not not the same

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,290
messaging but something along the same

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,260
lines in terms of being able to test

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,810
dependencies people who depend on your

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,370
modules and packages so anyway that

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,370
should be an interesting talk as well I

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:49,960
think you're giving one aren't you oh

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:52,410
yes anyone else yeah we have Chris

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:57,940
Heller is giving a talk on tooling I

00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:02,700
moderated a security panel and I think

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:09,700
there's a talk by on no dread as well

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:12,490
great great yeah excellent so what are

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,930
the other things you know this is in the

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,800
in the community but also this kind of

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,120
important is you know we have put a fair

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,970
amount of work to make sure that no GS

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,650
runs on IBM's platform so anything from

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,410
you know Linux on Z Linux on PE AIX or

00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:32,020
even IBM I where Jesse Gore's insky who

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,750
does a great job advocating for open

00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,910
source on IBM all I tells me it's like

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,070
up to 25 percent of our customers are

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,570
using node on IBM I now it's it's

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,940
actually when I go to the conferences

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,190
it's just great to see how excited

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,980
people are about nodejs in in that

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,140
environment where you know there they

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,540
are in businesses maybe they're

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,070
supporting manufacturing or some other

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,080
types of factories and it's it's great

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,210
to see them starting to use node.js for

00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,980
all that kind of work as well no json

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,260
the mainframe and that's right and

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,120
mainframe is is another area where you

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,910
know people there's significant interest

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,010
of people starting to run you know the

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,670
right workloads to get the advantages

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:16,940
that you do with known you know we have

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:20,060
a lot of internal use of node.js as well

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,800
multiple teams multiple projects of a

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,460
variety of ways where we're implementing

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:28,490
node internally and a very vibrant

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,080
community through slack channels an

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,430
assortment of them I think the nodejs

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,200
channel has 1600 people or more and some

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,230
some major deployments as well right

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,520
Michael yeah oh definitely and on that

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,050
major deployment front there were a

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,670
couple that we want to share today just

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,040
to show you the scope of some of the

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,290
deployments that we have in in in IBM

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,050
the first one is the IBM cloud console

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,650
so if you've ever gone to use the IBM

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,750
cloud it provides the UI and this lets

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,950
you know you create those different

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,400
services like whether you're creating

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,760
your kubernetes clusters virtual servers

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,290
bare metal machines cloud foundry type

00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,570
applications servers service

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,930
applications the cloud UI is a node.js

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,690
application supporting all of that it

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,960
also provides sort of a plug-in

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,790
framework in that when we want to bring

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,589
a new service because the IBM cloud

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,140
provides services in addition to those

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:27,080
sort of foundational components like

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,850
open shift and kubernetes we have teams

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,010
who want to deliver services through the

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,560
cloud and it provides a plug-in type

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,910
architecture where they can easily take

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,180
advantage of things like registration

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,910
onboarding access management billing and

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,070
usage without having to rewrite that all

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,650
and it's all written in node.js which is

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,050
great yeah that plug-in that plugin

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,110
approach is really smart it allows a lot

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,959
of teams to take advantage of the

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,880
platform and you know as we can see

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,410
there's over 50 teams who have taken

00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,510
advantage of that so that just gives you

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,190
an idea of how much use there is and

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,500
that we have 50 different teams who've

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,740
just contributed you know node.js

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,589
applications to the IBM cloud the the

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,830
application itself is over 90 micro

00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:16,040
services it's deployed to kubernetes and

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,690
it's distributed over 10 different you

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,610
know geographically load-balanced

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:23,300
clusters across the world so really a

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,760
big node application that we run 24/7

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,130
yeah the IBM cloud console is a great

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,660
example I think the weather company is

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,490
another one right

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,370
yeah the weather company is the next one

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,480
in that you may have even gone there to

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,480
check your weather you can get the

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,430
seven-day forecast you could also you

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,510
know it has a whole bunch of API and so

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,760
it can help you make your application

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:46,190
better by incorporating weather data and

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,930
in a lot of cases you know that can

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,840
really add value for example if you've

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,420
got you know a site that helps people

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,990
pick when they want to plant seeds or

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,810
anything else related to growing food or

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,580
or plants it'd be great to be able to

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,990
give them insight in terms you know

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,600
maybe when it's gonna be a good time to

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,720
do things based on the weather or not

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,670
yeah I was a part of all proof of

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,000
concept application that we built that

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:18,320
was a logistics company and we used

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,910
weather api's to know when a storm was

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,500
happening or going to happen and

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,600
reroutes shipping routes to accommodate

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,070
for these sorts of storms and such yeah

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,920
that stuff's really really really

00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,480
important yeah looking back to the

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,960
application itself again it's another

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,480
big nodejs application it's it serves

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,940
buildings locations you know all sorts

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,220
of cities zip codes internationalize we

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,250
mentioned internationalization before 60

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,040
languages 230 different locales and it's

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,080
deployed in four different regions seven

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,300
kubernetes clusters four hundred more

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,220
than four hundred worker nodes dozen

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,830
services which can be like maybe three

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,400
replicas or 100 replicas again all

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,900
running on the IBM cloud 24/7 so you

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,970
know another really big nodejs

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,270
application that you know IBM runs and

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,069
operates you know just showing that what

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,740
you can do with nodejs and how we're

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,569
using it yeah let's take a moment and

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,650
talk about deploying

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,180
nodejs on IBM cloud right we just want

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,810
to mention a couple ways you can deploy

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,490
nodejs you know one is the ivan public

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,839
cloud and the other one is IBM cloud

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,100
pack for applications if you don't

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,580
necessarily want to move all of your

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,970
workload up up to the cloud in terms of

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,190
the IBM cloud you know it's it provides

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,460
a whole bunch of services sort of

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,360
foundational services so things like

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:45,059
OpenShift kubernetes

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,650
over lists you know but in addition to

00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,360
that it loads in a whole bunch of

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,740
services so if you need a database you

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,720
can get a service for that if you need

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,190
to connect to I owe t devices there'll

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,630
be a service for that if you need to

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,660
send emails there'll be a service for

00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,000
that so it it's broadly you know has the

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,950
data centers all over the world and

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,809
really provides you all the components

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,059
that you'll need to deploy your nodejs

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:10,220
application successfully and scale as

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:13,440
you need to across the world

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,500
yeah and using the IBM cloud pack for

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,330
applications it's a great way to do that

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,919
yeah it's it's you know if you don't

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,290
want to move all your applications up to

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,840
the cloud the way I look at IBM cloud

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,720
pack for applications is there's lots of

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,460
great projects in open source and I can

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,260
go and collect all those together myself

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,790
but it's a little bit like building the

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,950
car by yourself do you want to go out

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,150
buy all the parts source all the parts

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,340
put it together

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,780
that's probably going to take you a lot

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
of time and effort just to get to that

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,780
point and once you've done that you're

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,309
you're probably on your own for support

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,880
because you've built your own custom

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:49,950
bespoke you know infrastructure IBM

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,000
cloud pack for applications builds on

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,660
those tried and tested open-source

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,940
applications but brings them all

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,799
together into a nicely packaged you know

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,429
offering so includes OpenShift

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,990
things like Tecton runtimes and packages

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,179
them all together as an integrated piece

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,580
you can buy and then get support for so

00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,530
if you don't want to move all your

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,090
applications up to the public cloud IBM

00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,419
cloud pack for applications is a great

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,740
option for you know having a cloud like

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,720
infrastructure being able to deploy

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,270
cloud native applications in your own

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,520
environment or some mix where it's it's

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,520
a hybrid you know some things locally

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,820
and some things up in the cloud as well

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,980
and you mentioned support as well right

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,780
yeah so you know once you get your

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,780
application to production it's of course

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,970
important to many people to be able to

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,559
have a trusted partner that can that can

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,240
help you out

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,660
not everybody has enough has as much

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,490
time and resources to be able to be

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,520
involved in the nodejs community so be

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,080
able to like you know if you find a bug

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,740
contributed PR or get it reviewed get it

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
landed and that's

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,770
something that you know IBM can do for

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,470
our customers because of our involvement

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,700
there we have a we have a number of

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,010
different options because you know

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,980
depending whether you're running in the

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,830
IBM cloud you're running on Red Hat

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,470
Enterprise Linux you know through our

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,179
Red Hat partnership or your you know

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,980
deploying on your own in the mainframe

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,300
you're going to need two different types

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,679
of support so we have a number of

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,270
different support offerings and you can

you can go to developer OBM dot-com

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,250
slash Technology slash nodejs it's right

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,970
on the home page of the developer dot I

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,890

a number of articles and tutorials and

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,460
deployment options and all the things

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,530
that we've been talking about are

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,940
available there as well yeah there's a

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,440
security and how to do deployments and

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,800
and that kind of stuff so we're just

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,660
gonna say that the weather company

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,830
architecture and deployment is

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,020
highlighted there as well as on the open

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,420
Jas blog yeah I know that's definitely a

because that would have been

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,140
