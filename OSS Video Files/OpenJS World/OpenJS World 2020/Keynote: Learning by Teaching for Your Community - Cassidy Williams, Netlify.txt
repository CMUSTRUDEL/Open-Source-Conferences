hello everyone and welcome to the

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,270
conference oh my goodness I'm so glad

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,730
that we were able to do this even with

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,490
the whole pandemic thing happening here

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,320
I I know that this is not the ideal

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,030
conditions for some kind of technical

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,949
event but I'm still glad that we're able

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,869
to have it together that being said I

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,060
wanted to talk a little bit more about

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,279
technical communities today because this

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,630
is something that I often don't normally

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,760
talk about I don't normally give very

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,070
technical talks but I think this is

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,929
something that's really important for

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,870
developers and non developers to know

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,180
about talk about and just understand and

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,210
really realize the value of what a

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,760
community can bring so that being said a

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,160
little introduction I'm going to get my

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,920

principal developer experience engineer

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,780
at nullify and my job is so fun I

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,909
haven't been there very long but I

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,799
really love just being able to interact

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,799
with developers a lot speak at events

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,390
like this one write blog posts and demos

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
and stuff for people to build with and

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,320
of course just work on that will file

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,390
together it's a really great team to be

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,460
a part of that being said I haven't

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,170
actually been at notify for very long

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,880
this is something that's that's a

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,009
relatively new role at the time I've

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,530
recorded this I think I just hit my

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,680
two-month mark that being said I've been

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,079
around a few different companies as you

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,090
can see her on the slide there there are

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,189
quite a few companies that have hopped

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,409
around to I first started it out of

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,600
college at venmo and went from venmo

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,490
over to clarify went from clarify Dell

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,229
for digital then to Amazon that Ducote

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,470
pendin to react training and to nullify

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,630
and all of these places were awesome

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,700
places to work for at venmo I was able

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,670
to do a lot of developer relations work

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,460
and also work on their both back-end and

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,229
front-end things and as awesome as it

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,500
was it was it was a great place to work

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,820
it was bought and it turned out that

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,979
PayPal the company that bought it they

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,450
were probably going to be cutting some

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,780
of the projects that I was involved with

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,020
and I didn't

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,900
want to have my projects be cut and so

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,490
as I was figuring out what to do I ended

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,590
up switching over to clarify and I

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,870
clarify I was doing developer relations

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,360
was loving it was working on the website

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,810
of things and had just an awesome time

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,180
working on that team and then kind of to

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,550
my surprise I was really tired of living

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,560
in New York City and it was a great

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,050
place to be in but I was ready to try

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,690
something new and so I ended up packing

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,340
my bags and left clarify to go off to

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,709
Seattle and work at a company called L

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,440
for digital l for digital was a creative

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,630
agency that was so fun to work for we

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,670
had a laser cutter in the office and and

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,050
got to play around with 3d printers and

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,300
also just work with some really

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,880
interesting clients and I loved kind of

00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,560
doing that creative side of coding and I

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,050
was doing some engineering management

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,390
work as well and as much as I loved that

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,030
they were bought I was part of another

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,880
acquisition and unfortunately with the

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,500
company that bought it l4 is no more it

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,450
was absorbed into this big company and

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,220
and I decided you know with all the

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,750
changes that they're making I guess it's

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,299
time for me to move on to another role

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,390
then I went on to Amazon and with Amazon

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,570
I worked on Alexa I don't want my device

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,269
to wake up in here and as as fun as it

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:32,110
was to work on that team you know she

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:34,180
woke up anyway as fun as it was to work

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,850
on that team and I got to work with my

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,640
sister as well which was always great to

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,200
be able to do it didn't really fit well

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
with me I realized that I didn't like

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,410
big companies and with some culture

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,720
shifts and in the company I just decided

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,609
that Amazon wasn't for me and so I

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,470
switched over to code pen the code pen

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,450
team is awesome it's pretty much the

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,640
exact opposite of Amazon size-wise it

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,799
was only eight people and I loved just

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,560
doing straight engineering work building

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,799
some awesome tools at code pen and and

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,690
loved it and then with that I was

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,060
realizing okay as much as I love coding

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,070
I kind of love speaking to I love being

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,829
with developers and interacting with

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,150
them more and as much as I loved code

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,400
pen this was something that I really

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,530
wanted to be a part of and so I ended up

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,110
switching over to react training react

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,270
training awesome company I was going to

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,759
speak at

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,220
conferences and give workshops and go to

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,560
events pretty constantly I was traveling

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,349
all the time I traveled more than three

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,110
times a month often and don't get me

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,720
wrong I loved it but it was it was a lot

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,190
of traveling and a lot of teaching and I

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,050
really loved being able to interact with

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:47,729
developers and then coronavirus hit and

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,500
unfortunately react training they had to

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,940
lay off all staff and it's something

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,060
that we didn't expect but it's something

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,530
that had to be done and after doing some

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,180
rapid interviewing and reaching out to

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,669
the network that's how I ended up at

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,139
natla Phi and I'm doing again developer

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,210
experience engineering here which is

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,159
part of the dev rel umbrella with a

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,949
little more coding here and there and

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,620
and I absolutely love it all this being

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,139
said to give you this very very fast

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,979
overview of my career history plans are

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,840
not real as as much as I've loved all of

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,759
my different jobs that I've been at and

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,770
being able to have the variety of

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,169
experiences that I've had I've never

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,300
planned on switching companies I've

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,849
never planned on going into a company

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,509
saying okay I'm going to be here for a

00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:36,479
year and then I'll switch I've never

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,969
wanted to leave a place and and this is

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,979
something that just happens factors

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:43,440
outside of your control can suddenly

00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,680
topple your career plans at a moment's

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,810
notice and this is especially true for

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,539
everyone now because of that pandemic

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,909
this is this is something that really a

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,520
lot of people right now are realizing

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,750
because you don't know if your job will

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,270
be at risk you don't know if your whole

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,330
company will be at risk you don't know

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,789
all of these things and and plans fall

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,569
through all the time and it's sad

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:11,460
sometimes it's frustrating sometimes but

00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:13,590
when something falls through this is a

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,900
quote from Kelly Hoey she's the author

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,520
of builder dream network when something

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,870
falls through don't lose the

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,699
relationship when you have an employer

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,199
that falls through an internship that

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,529
falls through a job offer that falls

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,090
through a role that falls through you

00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,880
shouldn't lose the relationships that

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,500
you have in those given companies and in

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,139
your given communities and I think that

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,759
this quote is very very powerful because

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,969
it really emphasizes the importance of

00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,150
people oftentimes when we are working on

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:48,240
such technical projects and coding day

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,729
in and day out it's sometimes easy to

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,879
forget the human side of things and it's

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,449
it's sometimes easy to forget the

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,279
communication that you have to have

00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,009
those people the the relationships that

00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,020
you have to build those people and this

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,719
is this is really the core of what I

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,680
want to talk about today is being a part

00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,469
of your community

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,409
you should really embrace your community

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:13,770
throughout my career of highs and lows

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:16,020
wanting to learn and grow I've really

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,529
learned that a community is the thing

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,229
that will keep me around in the industry

00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,900
as a whole whether whether you are in

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,400
tech or in some other industry this this

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,680
could really apply to all sorts of

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,500
things if you have a community that is

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,419
around you that will stick around and a

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,740
community that supports you you are more

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:40,110
likely to stay in that industry and

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,779
threw him out throughout my career just

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,550
in this past this past season of the

00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,710
pandemic one react training fell through

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,039
my network is what helps me get

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:53,189
interviews when I was moving from New

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,259
York to Seattle I was nervous because I

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,909
didn't know anybody in Seattle but I

00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,370
knew people who knew people in Seattle

00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,349
it's it's something that people don't

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,659
often consider when they're trying to

00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,729
move up the career ladder and trying to

00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:08,250
be the best technical person that they

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,279
can be we kind of just focus on the code

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,009
we try to just learn as much as we can

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,399
and and build as much as we can and that

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,649
being said the best way to learn and my

00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,659
humble opinion is to teach your

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,509
community it's not just about being a

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:26,580
part of a community and shouting around

00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,949
and saying oh I'm here it's about

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,479
teaching and giving back to they do say

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:35,070
that the best way to learn is to teach

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,169
and a few years ago personally I decided

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,180
to make my first online class for

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,880
beginner web dev so it was just a very

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,699
basic HTML and CSS course and I made it

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,550
with my sister and even though it was

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:48,910
just HTML and CSS is something that I've

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,130
been using since I was a young

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,060
teenager I learned so much in the

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,920
process about what it is in theory and

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,320
in practice and different things that I

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,930
had used before but never really

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,790
understood why I used it before just by

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,910
making this course for other people and

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:09,550
it really kind of opened my eyes to how

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,990
much you can learn by teaching and since

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,000
then I've taught a few other online

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,500
courses and of course I worked at react

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,130
training I was teaching courses in

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,020
person and online and when you teach

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,630
when you show people how to do something

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,130
you understand a topic that much deeper

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,600
so yes you can say oh I have no time for

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,700
people I have no time for building

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,860
friendships in the office I have no time

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,500
for building out a network I want to

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,840
build my apps but really when you teach

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,850
your community when you work on things

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,800
that can be shared with others this is

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,570
something that can teach you deeper than

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,790
you could ever imagine the whole concept

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,370
of learning in public is really really

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,170
important alongside the online courses

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,120
that I built I've built a lot of

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,730
tutorials for projects I was building

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,640
and by writing the tutorial at the exact

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,990
same time as building a project I

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,760
understood my project at a much deeper

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,730
level than I would have if I were just

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,710
building it another thing that I started

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,570
doing was I started a technical

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,390
newsletter that I've been sending it's

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,640
hard to believe almost three years now

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,020
where I've just been sending technical

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,240
interview questions every single week

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,070
where others can practice interview

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,630
questions and I can practice them too

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,400
and we can learn from each other to see

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,350
how people solve different things and it

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,820
has different web dev articles and stuff

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,200
I promise this isn't meant to be a

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,240
shameless plug this is just something

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,800
that I've done where it started as a

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,960
thing where I was like oh maybe this

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,730
could be useful to people where now it's

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,730
such an invaluable resource to myself

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,500
but also to others where we can learn

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,350
from each other and I've learned so much

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,210
just from asking a question that I might

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,190
struggle to solve and then trying to

00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,470
solve it but then seeing how others

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,830
might solve it and and kind of gathering

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,840
resources where you kind of open up your

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,760
newsletters of the week or your Twitter

00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,950
or your hacker news or whatever and have

00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,280
tons of tabs open of tabs that you might

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,310
read someday too now if I'm giving links

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,960
to other people

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,790
that kind of forces me to read those

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,070
articles and to understand the content

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,680
of those articles and learn the contents

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,590
much much better they there are so many

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,360
different things that you can do to kind

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,610
of pay it forward into your community

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,800
that will teach you so much better and

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:24,020
it's all about kind of giving and taking

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,420
there's this great quote by Erin Newkirk

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,430
she's the CMO over at local crate the

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,440
smartest people I know start building

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,230
relationships before they quote/unquote

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,720
need them and this is this is something

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,570
that's so true especially in the

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,660
technical field where we should build

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:45,740
relationships with people and be a giver

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,810
not a taker before before you ever want

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,360
to reach out to people you you want to

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,190
be able to be that person where you can

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,140
offer something to the community to make

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,880
it grow to make it flourish I don't know

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,490
if any of you have seen Parks and Rec

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,980
that it's such a funny show but there's

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,430
there's a scene with Leslie Knope where

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,710
she is trying to plan for a festival and

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,120
they need they need the police

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,420
department to be able to provide

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,990
security at this festival and they keep

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,060
almost asking favors and they keep kind

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,710
of holding back and and never actually

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,470
asking a favor and then eventually

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,180
another character Ben goes and asks the

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,390
favor for her and says hey would you be

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,760
able to do this and the police chief

00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,190
said you know for Leslie Knope yes she

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,830
gets whatever favors she wants and when

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,980
Ben asks why he says because for Leslie

00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,360
Knope she's doing these she's asking

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,490
these favors for other people

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,800
she's asking not from a selfish

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,360
perspective but to to help things and

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,670
that's not to say that you should never

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,700
be selfish of course but to have that

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:53,020
sort of attitude to be a giver first and

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,370
not a taker first is really really key

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,770
often when people network with others

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,080
whether you're at an event online or

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,570
offline or you're even emailing or

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,250
interacting with Twitter they

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,810
immediately think how can I get the most

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,450
out of this relationship and you can

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:11,000
kind of tell that right away this this

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,259
kind of this kind of attitude leads to

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,089
really awkward mentorship proposals side

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,220
don't do that don't just go up to a

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:21,609
person and say will you be my mentor as

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm sure that that has worked for some

00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:25,720
people but it doesn't really foster a

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,369
relationship it's just saying hey will

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,369
you be my mentor here's a series of

00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:32,889
questions you can its robotic you can

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:34,419
gauge my progress over time I hope you

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,579
get something out of this like I will

00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,309
it's that's something that you don't

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:41,679
want to do it being someone who is a

00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:43,660
taker first it leads to unrealistic asks

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,819
and honestly eventually people start

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,259
kind of screamin your emails and calls

00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,569
because they know that you're the kind

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,970
of person who will always ask things and

00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:53,859
never give back you don't want people to

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,600
even have the slightest bit of dread

00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,309
when they see a message from you this

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,839
also goes out to you managers out there

00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:01,419
you don't want to be that person that

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,249
says hey can you talk and then gives no

00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:05,350
context for the meeting and give someone

00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:07,029
stress for the rest of the day you

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,739
always want to be the person where when

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,259
people see a message from you they're

00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:14,379
enthusiastic about what you might be

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:16,269
asking whether it's a give or a take you

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,879
want to be the person that passes along

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,279
job leads shares information connects

00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,829
with others connects others together and

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,709
helps people grow you want to be the

00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,939
person where when people hear from you

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,669
they're delighted to hear from you

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:32,439
because it has something to do with the

00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:34,480
community and if you are doing and ask

00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:37,749
where it might be for your personal self

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,149
they're happy to ask to give to that ask

00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:43,149
because you're the one who has given

00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:43,779
first and I don't want people to step

00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,609
all over you

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,410
this isn't the kind of thing where you

00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:50,649
should say yes to absolutely everything

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,319
and just kind of let people ask you for

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:56,019
unrealistic things be discerning and be

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,029
rational about what you accept but be as

00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,179
much of a giver as you can because that

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:04,029
is what a community is about a community

00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:05,709
is a give and take and if you only take

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:09,549
that's not community building that's

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:12,639
just building yourself for what if again

00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:14,470
when plans aren't real and you're kind

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,869
of only taking things for yourself if

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,199
your job falls through if a pandemic

00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:21,759
happens if the unthinkable happens you

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,939
want people to be there who can be your

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,139
support and you get that support because

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:30,859
you support the community first

00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,929
so all this being said be the community

00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:35,749
member you want to see in the world as

00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:38,989
cheesy as the quote sounds being able to

00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:41,359
teach others to give technically so that

00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,040
way you can learn technically to be the

00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,899
person that fosters a community where

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,579
people want to say oh I bet that they'd

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,559
be interested in this technical project

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,109
or oh I bet that they would enjoy this

00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,660
and being the person that people think

00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:56,329
of because you have already thought of

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,309
them is such a rewarding thing and it's

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,199
something that fosters a wonderful

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:03,199
community that people want to be a part

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,179
of and that people grow you want to be

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,029
able to lift as you climb where as you

00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:10,129
move up in your career ladder and and in

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,049
a given community you want to help

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,660
people grow along with you so that way

00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:17,480
there's always room for more and people
