hey everyone my name is melta and i'm a

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,680
member of the technical steering

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
committee for the amp project

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
and the tech lead for the team at google

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,200
that's contributing to app

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,480
now i want to recognize that there are

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
worse problems in the world right now

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
than javascript frameworks and web

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,920
performance

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
i want to thank the protesters in the

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
streets and unequivocally state that

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
black lives matter

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
in today's talk i'll talk a little bit

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
around the original thinking about amp

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
how it evolved over time and how we

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,239
think it will develop in the future

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
now thinking back to like the summer of

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,719
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,320
this post by the wire even though it's a

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
little bit older it was kind of

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
capturing the sentiment at the time like

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,520
the web is that

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
native is taking over and also at this

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
time platforms like facebook instant

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
articles and apple news are kind of

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
coming up

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
and we were having all these

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
conversations publishers who were

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
talking to us and were worried about the

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,320
situation and wanted to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,000
find a solution that worked for them and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,760
work for users and kind of

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,879
made the web um become um viable for

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,400
users again and obviously

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,000
for us at google this was also really

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,360
important because we're extraordinarily

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
successful on the web

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,600
and kind of out of this sentiment um the

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
amp project was born

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,840
with the vision of creating a strong

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
user first open web forever now we

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
highlight user first because it's really

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,640
about rethinking how we can do things in

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
a way

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
that they really think about what the

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
users want and make it great for them

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
instead of for example putting a

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
you know pop-up app in front of everyone

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
however

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
for it to stick around forever it also

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,600
must work for publishers and merchants

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
because if their business aren't

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
successful you know that website will

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,799
just go away

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,399
now one good way i think to think about

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
how we wanted amp to be was

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
to kind of think about that performance

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
is this race

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,200
different race cars right and so

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
certainly in 2015 i'm not sure this

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
actually changed was that the average

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
mobile site you know just wasn't doing

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,799
quite

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
uh so well and was kind of there in the

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
back of that

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,960
race right and but we also realized that

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,879
there wasn't actually this is really

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
important that was not a technology

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
problem

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,360
you could make a website with great ux

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
great performance who was right there at

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
the top right if you just hand tune it

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
if you were an expert

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
now our goal with amp was to get up

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
there

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
in the front we were not aiming to win

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
against every hand tuned website in the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
world

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
we just wanted to be up there and and

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,040
this is really important

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,879
we wanted everyone to be up there right

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
all amp documents

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
and um this actually brings me to a

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
point i don't think it's

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
talked about enough which is that web

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
performance

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,319
is biased right roughly

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,840
the smaller a website is the less well

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,040
funded it is the slower it is

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,080
and i'm really really proud that amp

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,560
does not have this bias very roughly you

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
know

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
obviously there's some variation but

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
like i'm documents have a

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
quite uniform speed even though there's

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
huge diversity in how they look and how

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
their

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,840
experiences and you know i think it's

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
it's fair to say that

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
this worked in terms of adoption there's

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
now tens of millions of websites using

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
and billions of pages

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
you can't count them and you also like

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,319
it doesn't matter right like it's a very

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,080
large number

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
so that's that's kind of how how we got

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
started and then

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
as it does the internet got mad at us

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
all right and i actually want to

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,799
acknowledge that like many

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,879
you know there's complaints and

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
criticism about amp and i actually

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,720
personally agree with many of them

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,200
and we've taken that to heart and and

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
worked of them right i want to broadly

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,319
summarize the known issues that amp was

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,080
facing as

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,000
one of them being awkward urls on google

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
that was largely based because of the

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,720
iframe based viewer which created that

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
privacy preserving instant loading

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
and on the other hand there was this

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
feature called top stories

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,680
carousel on google that relied on a deep

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
amp integration

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
and thus was exclusive to amp and you

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
know if you didn't want to make an amp

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
page

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
you got sad right and i think that's

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,200
that's really fair so

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
um we've worked on these issues and and

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720
today

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
um with the sign exchange technology um

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,240
in support of browsers

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,520
those awkward urls are no longer a thing

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
and and secondly

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,320
this is announced really recently and

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
i'm going to talk about this a little

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,360
bit later in the talk

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
with google's page experience ranking

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,800
announcement

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,199
the exclusivity of amp for the top score

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,120
sale carousel is going away

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
now we worked on these issues but we

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
didn't stop there

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,560
um amp started like so many open source

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
projects

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,080
with this benevolent dictator model

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
which is awkward and weird and

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,840
apparently that was me and it certainly

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,680
doesn't represent all the constituencies

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,520
of this like vast open source project

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,280
with all these all these stakeholders

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,040
and so we updated it to modern open

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
governance model largely actually

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
inspired by

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
by node.js who i think was in the

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,639
forefront of kind of

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,240
rethinking how how open source

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,840
governance should work there's a

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
technical steering committee an advisory

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
committee

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
and so forth um the second thing we you

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
know

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
were planning to do at the time was to

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,320
bring this project which is you know

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,639
formally as in copyright

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
owned by google into our foundation and

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
so last fall

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,840
um it was announced that the amp project

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,240
would join the

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,720
incubation phase to become a

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,840
project of the open js foundation and so

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
today

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,000
i'm incredibly proud to announce that

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
the amp project has completed the

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
incubation project and is joining the

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
opengs foundation as a growth

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,240
project there's actually one more

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,360
announcement which i'm extraordinarily

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,199
happy about just came in literally today

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
we have a new member in the m technical

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,360
theorem committee kasiana

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
who's representing axia's media which is

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
one of the um

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,919
you know a very important publisher

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
in the digital native space and we're

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
actually really happy to have her

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
because um

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,680
so far on the steering committee that's

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
different from the advisory committee

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
obviously

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,479
we did not have a representation from

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,000
publishers with platforms like pinterest

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
twitter microsoft but like there was no

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,720
publisher or presentation this is really

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
amazing to have her now looking a little

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,360
bit ahead

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,039
i think the mission of continues to be

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,880
more important than ever

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,520
we still see that bias of web

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,319
performance being better for large sites

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
as a whole for the web and users also

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,240
you know continue to seek out the

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,120
streamlined experiences that we find in

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
wallet gardens now

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,840
i touched on this a little bit earlier i

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,759
just want to talk really quick about

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,960
that what google is calling

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,840
page experience signals and ranking

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,919
so this is largely based on something

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
called core web vitals which are three

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,120
metrics

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,280
largest contentful paid first input

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
delay and cumulative layout shift

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,479
now these are all metrics that went

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,840
through the respective working groups in

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,000
the w3c

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
um representing loading interactivity

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
visual stability of

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
our websites and kind of they're taking

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
together and they're bundled with like

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,720
other signals like mobile friendliness

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
safe browsing https i don't think

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
they're as important because nowadays

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
most websites actually kind of do

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
okay on them so it's really these

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
metrics which are collected using a

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
chrome user experience report

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
that drive um these ranking factors

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,039
right and it doesn't matter

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
how a website is built technology is not

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,319
taken into account it's just

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
basically what is the user experiencing

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,280
that's why accounting and so i would

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,360
summarize that a little bit like this

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
you know basically google saying hey we

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
prefer if you provide a good page

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
experience

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,680
we literally do not care how you do it

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
and some desks will say cool i'll use x

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
my favorite framework

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,639
and they're happy but we also know

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,479
there's folks who are going to say

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
yeah you know but like some guidance

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,680
would be nice um and

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,199
you know we want to make amp to be um

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
you know the framework of their choice

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
if they to choose right and and

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
again bring give everyone the

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
opportunity to be

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,879
right there at the top of that web

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
performance race

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
we want to make amp the most cost

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,280
effective and simplest solution for

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,840
publishers to create great

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
page experience and we want to match or

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,840
exceed the user experience

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,759
that closed platforms provide and do

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,639
that by default so that without

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,639
major ux project for every every single

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,520
web publisher on the web

while keeping the business goals of the

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,959
website owners in mind because

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,159
if they aren't successful the websites

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,159
aren't sticking around and that would

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,399
