hey everyone thank you for joining me

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,300
today here at open Jas I hope all of you

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,610
and your loved ones are staying safe and

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,460
healthy during these difficult times

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,560
that we're in my name is sana Ajani

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,600
and I'm a program manager at Microsoft

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,460
on the Visual Studio code team I'm

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,010
really excited to be here today I'm

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,560
coming to you from New Jersey from my

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,060
high school bedroom so today I'm going

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,570
to be showing you some really awesome

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,550
tips and tricks on how to be productive

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,640
inside vs code no matter what kind of

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,620
developer you are I hope you enjoy the

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,149
session please give us feedback tell us

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,640
what you want to hear from BS code and

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,239
let's get started all right let's get

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,190
started

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,860
today we're going to spend most of the

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,350
time inside the tool itself this is

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,510
going to be jam-packed with lots of v/s

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,520
code goodness I'll start with showing

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,289
some small quality-of-life tips and

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,719
tricks and then I'll go into showing a

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,670
demo of some of the latest github

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,589
integration that we've added and then

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,299
finally I'll do an overview of what

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,420
remote development is and I'll show a

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,580
demo of one of the extensions so the

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,520
very first tip is vs code insiders

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,439
you'll notice I have two versions of vs

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,020
code on my desktop here and I'm using

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,740
the one with the green icon or the vs

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,680
code insiders build this is the one our

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,180
team uses to actually work on vs code so

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,759
it's straight from master you're going

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,610
to be using the hottest bits if you use

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,920
insiders you get a lot of the latest

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,450
features that are still in preview or

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,000
things that we're experimenting with

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,189
that we would like feedback on and if

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,290
you find a bug or an issue and you

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,880
report it we can typically get that fix

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,799
within a day or two so it's a really

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,470
fast turnaround you can have both

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,110
installed side by side the stable

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,540
version and insiders they are isolated

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,600
from each other and you can go to code

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,079
Visual Studio comm slash insiders to

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,899
install it now let's go on to the next

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,270
part of customizing the editor I think

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,910
the best part of vs code is that it is

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,770
extensible and flexible to however you

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,870
like to code or whatever your

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,780
productivity workflow or style is

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,510
with extensions and settings even the

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,720
layout there is just so much ways to

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,400
customize vs code so my vs code will

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,750
look different from your vs code and

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,790
that's totally fine

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,910
right we want vs code to work the way

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,610
that all developers work so some of the

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,910
most important shortcuts and things you

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,880
remember the first one is the command

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,220
palette so every action that you do in

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,130
vs code can basically be mapped to a

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,050
command if you are on Windows it's ctrl

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,870
shift P or if you're in a Mac its

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,080
command shift P or you can use f1 so if

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,480
I do this this opens up the command

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,330
palette so if you're ever wondering hey

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,610
I wonder how to open this part or I

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,740
wonder if vs code can do this you can

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,560
search for something that you want to do

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,120
and they'll typically show up in here

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,070
extensions can also contribute command

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,320
to this so for instance you see I have a

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,500
bunch that are from like this github

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,210
issues extension or I can just type

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,280
things in so if I want to see all the

00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,950
git related things I can do there's a

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,489
whole bunch of commands that you can

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:30,340
access from the command palette the next

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:33,070
pro tip is the settings so this is going

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,020
to be control comma or command comma so

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,330
if I do this this will open up my

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,140
settings editor there are two settings

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,420
editors in vs code both a UI which

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,580
you're seeing right now and a JSON so if

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,980
you prefer one or the other you can

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,940
change this shortcut so if I search for

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,590
settings you can see here the setting

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,959
for settings editor so I have it set to

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,200
the UI but if you prefer JSON you can do

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,570
this go click that command command comma

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,019
and I'll open up your settings editor in

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,019
JSON

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,780
also while we're in settings if you

00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,480
don't already have this turned on you

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:22,270
definitely must do this right now

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:25,330
search for autosave autosave has

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,130
literally saved lives no joke this is

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,410
going to see your workflow if you don't

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,150
already have this turned on there's

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,580
different options that you can turn on I

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,730
have it on focus change so if I switch

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,720
editors or switch my window this is what

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:43,870
I prefer but also if you're a JavaScript

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,460
editor a developer sorry another thing

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,730
that might be useful for you instead of

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,740
for my autosave is format on save so you

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,750
can have one or the other typically set

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,050
and this is if you're you know using

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,120
something like prettier or some kind of

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,650
formatter and you prefer to use this

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,570
every time you see if it will just

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,670
format everything with your prettier

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:11,950
config so this is really convenient for

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:14,230
a lot of JavaScript developers let's go

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,090
into some other quick keyboard shortcuts

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,400
that are really going to help you when

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,810
you're coding inside the editor so I'm

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,550
open up the markdown file of this

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,250
copying line up and down so this is a

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,170
really good tip that I really like so if

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,490
you are using a Mac it's gonna be shift

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,500
option up or down so if I do this I can

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,510
actually take each line and just really

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,180
easily move it to the right place so

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,220
this is a really easy and important tip

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,860
that saved me a lot of time instead of

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,640
copying pasting another one is multiple

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,340
cursors this is awesome this is going to

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,380
save you so much time so there's

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,570
different ways to do this the one that's

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,450
easy to do a few if you prefer using a

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,760
mouse is option click so I can actually

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:06,490
place where I want the cursors to be in

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:08,320
this one or you can use shift command L

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,080
and this will actually highlight the

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,570
same word every time it's found so for

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,080
instance I can click on this and go

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,940
shift command L and it'll highlight

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,979
every instance of the word command or

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,760
customized and then I can start working

00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,140
on it here

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,570
so there's different ways to use

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,220
multiple cursors but definitely use them

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,220
in your workflow it's very very helpful

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:37,240
and now it's going to showing you how to

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,920
customize your vs codes layout so first

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,530
thing you can do is actually move around

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,510
things in the activity bar inside bar a

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,540
lot of people don't you can do this you

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,280
can move icons around that you get from

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,830
different extensions you can right-click

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,870
and also hide different you know

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,550
extensions icon so you can make your

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,320
activity bar a little bit cleaner if you

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,690
want same with the status bar you can

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,900
choose to hide things or show things

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,640
however you want but one of the latest

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,490
things that we've done inside vs code is

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,820
actually help you customize your layout

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,610
a little bit more so if you do ctrl or

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,070
command tilde or sorry backtick this is

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,930
going to open up a terminal so we want

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,910
to give you more freedom to be able to

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,670
move things between the terminal and

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,020
this sidebar over here so when you have

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,610
all this open it can be a little bit

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,900
much and maybe you want to move

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,230
different views to different places

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,810
based on your preferred workflow so for

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,360
instance if I wanted to maybe take the

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,350
search panel over here and move it into

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,100
my bottom view I can do that now and now

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,660
I get the same search functionality

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,240
still works still does the same thing it

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,950
would if it was in the other place and I

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
can also do the vice versa so if I want

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:53,650
to maybe take the debug console here and

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,840
maybe move it inside my debug view I can

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,930
do that too it's really sweet it's

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,940
really easy helps you really totally

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,460
customize and take control of your

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,140
editor and say maybe you are moving

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,690
things around experimenting and maybe

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,490
you maybe set something to a different

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,280
location you can just right-click on the

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,100
view and reset the location or you can

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,690
search for the command reset view and it

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,870
does the same thing so now everything's

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,060
back to where it was another pro tip is

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,670
I've heard from a lot of users that they

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,310
actually prefer this sidebar to be on

00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:31,120
the right side and not on the left side

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:34,710
so you can go to view appearance and you

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,710
can move the sidebar to the right

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,740
and some people prefer this because when

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,750
they actually toggle this it will not

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,700
actually move their code or their editor

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,430
but if it's on the right if it's on the

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,590
left side it will so I can move a bar it

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,120
back to the left and this actually moves

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,550
your code which it can be a little bit

00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,890
jarring so these are some really quick

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,600
and easy pro tips on customizing your

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,970
editor customizing your keyboard

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,490
shortcuts making use of them to really

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:08,320
be productive inside vs code and next

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:16,660
I'll go into showing some github related

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:18,400
features all right let's talk github so

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,780
on the vs Co team we want to make you as

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,300
productive as possible

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,340
when we talk to developers we often hear

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,620
things like there's so much context

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,380
switching so for instance when I move

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,630
from all my tabs I have open on github

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,210
and back to my code I lose track of a

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,760
lot of things I lose time I lose focus

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,340
so we want to make the stuff that you do

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,770
on github closer to you inside your

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,620
editor we want to bring the outer loop a

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,120
lot of the collaboration you know

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,280
documentation stuff that you do on

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,470
github closer to where you're actually

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,850
writing your code so that there is less

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,860
context switching you're not jumping

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,700
around as much and you can be more

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,410
focused and productive so one of the

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,820
extensions that you definitely need to

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,220
have installed if you're working with

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,580
github and any capacity is the github

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,190
pull requests and issues extension so I

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,300
can search for it inside the extension

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,790
marketplace it's the one that's

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,910
published by github so this lets you

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,310
create and manage comment on and merge

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,400
pull requests from inside vs code and

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:24,880
most recently we also added support to

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,410
let you work with issues as well so once

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,290
you have this installed it's going to

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,960
contribute this icon to the activity bar

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,490
and it's going to ask you to sign in so

00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,230
you have to do that once so now I'm

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,790
going to open up a new window so we

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,250
wanted to make it really easy for anyone

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,170
to get started with github as well so

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,300
this is a totally empty project it's an

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,790
empty window I'm going to clone a

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,340
repository so because I've

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,680
in with the github pull request

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,530
extension it's going to leverage that

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,960
and let me clone from github so you can

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,940
see here this populated a list of all

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,460
the repos that are actually associated

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,410
with me on my github profile this is

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,040
really neat really convenient for me to

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,500
be able to just clone a repository but I

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,150
can also search for any anything on

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,600
github so for instance if I wanted to

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,980
maybe work on a react project I could do

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,640
that I could just search for create

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,880
react tap alright let's clone that to my

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,070
local machine you can see here vs code

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,910
is doing that real quick let's open in a

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,830
new window and I have it installed right

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,120
that was really easy normally with

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,870
cloning something you have to go to

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,610
github no get the link bring it in your

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,620
terminal do all that so we want to make

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,160
it super super easy for you to get

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,350
started

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,080
so if I open up my terminal let's just

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,110
check if everything worked out all right

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,780
so Villa's code cloned it and set up my

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:56,620
remotes for me over HTTP this is really

00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,420
easy great to get started with the great

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,650
to just do it from inside your editor if

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,140
you want to alright I want to show some

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,780
more really cool things the github

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,390
extension lets you do inside vs code so

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,100
I've opened up a folder with a project I

00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,440
have called task runner and this is a vs

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,020
code extension that lets you view and

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,470
p.m. you know whatever tasks you have

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,360
inside your project so let's work on

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,370
this and show off how to use the pull

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,220
request and issues view so I can go to

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,600
this github view over here and you can

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,060
see I have two sections for my pull

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,650
requests and issues so I can click on

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,770
this and they'll actually just show me

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,720
all of the open PRS I have and I can

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,850
also have them in these specific

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,540
categories with these specific filters

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:46,060
so we have one that I can open it up and

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,040
view the description of this and this

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,120
view should look really similar to what

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,220
it is on github you can check out the

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,200
branch we heard that this was something

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,510
that a lot of developers didn't do as

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,280
often as they wanted to because there's

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,529
just so many commands with git fetch and

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,749
get add this just lets you check out

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:09,029
the PR branch and tested out yourself

00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:11,679
you can go into and view the actual dif

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,749
so this is really neat lets you view the

00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,669
dif if I want to change how I view the

00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:18,129
DIF I can toggle the view from this

00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:21,909
split one to an inline whatever you

00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:25,599
prefer if I want to I can add a comment

00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:27,219
looks good to me and just leave that and

00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:32,619
start a review or just add a single

00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:35,079
comment and then I can also use

00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,999
different ways to merge the pr so you

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,979
can create a merge commit or you can use

00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:42,459
squash or rebase whatever you prefer to

00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:45,789
do so this is a really easy way to make

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,879
collaboration and bring it back into the

00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:51,159
editor if I wanted to I can also assign

00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,769
reviewers that have worked in this

00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:56,759
repository with me or assign labels to

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,759
this PR as well

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,320
I can also get a really good integration

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:09,680
with issues so if you're working in a

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,279
repository where you maybe track feature

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,800
requests or bug fixes on issues you can

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,779
do that from inside the editor so by

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,579
default there will be two categories

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,790
here listed my issues that have been

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,760
assigned to me and then issues that I've

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,860
created so if you want to customize this

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,470
a bit further and actually keep track of

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,380
more specific maybe labels or more

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,959
specific things that you've been like

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,490
assigned with keywords you can you can

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,050
do that so I'm going to click on this

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,200
pencil here and it's going to open up

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,149
the settings for this extension and you

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,180
can see here all the queries I'm using

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,790
to populate this list so for instance if

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,680
you prefer to keep track of issues with

00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,700
a certain keyword or the certain label

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,010
we can do that

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,420
so let's add one maybe let's call it

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:02,269
feature requests and we can add the

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,310
query the query syntax is the same as

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,110
the one as you would use on github and

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,019
we've also added in a couple of these

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,180
variables because we can do that now in

00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:14,120
vs code so let's do the current

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,269
repository that I own this is my

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,970
repository and I'm gonna do the label

00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:23,440
feature request because that's what I

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,420
use for incoming issues like that and

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,839
now I get that as well so this is really

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:32,449
all about making it really easy for you

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,750
to see and keep track of and not lose

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:38,510
all the different issues or things that

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,300
have been assigned to you so we can also

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,130
just create issues and not just manage

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,390
them from this extension so if I go back

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:50,209
to my readme this is where I sort of

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,670
keep track of all the upcoming - do they

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:58,699
have for my project so let's add one

00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,560
here let's add a to do to get user test

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,540
running because I've been wanting to do

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,279
that for a while so the cool thing you

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,990
see here is there was a light bulb that

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,410
popped up when I did that to do comment

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,170
so this will give me a suggestion to

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:15,260
create an issue based on this to do

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,510
comment trigger but better

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,660
yet I can actually create the issue and

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:23,360
also assign it to someone so if I click

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,280
on at I get a list of all the people

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,470
that have worked on my project with me

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,180
that are on this repo and I can assign

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,230
it to someone so let's assign it to me

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,190
this is something I've been wanting to

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:37,220
do and then you let's create the issue

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,780
get user test running perfect all right

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,640
and that's what I did it created an

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,130
issue over here so if I hover over this

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,680
it gave me the issue number I can click

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,560
on it go back to it on github and I can

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,840
also view it now from the same view I

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,420
saw earlier so my issue is this is the

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,730
new one assigned to me it's ready for me

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,680
to work on really convenient really easy

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,140
I can click on this arrow and start

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,750
working on it so now you see I have

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:07,430
switched over to a new branch for me to

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:09,560
work on this issue and you can change

00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,660
these settings again from your settings

00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,699
so JSON if you don't want to open up a

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,770
new branch you can do that you can

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:20,150
choose whatever you want say I made a

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:22,459
quick change let's make the fix I can go

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,070
over to my source control view and it'll

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,170
actually autofill the commit message for

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,900
me and it will close the issue when I

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,630
check it in so this is organic really

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,060
sort of closing the loop you can open up

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,500
an issue search through issues and then

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,350
start working on them and just close

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,540
them from inside vs code no need for

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,510
context switching making it really

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,610
easier to bring that outer developer

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,590
loop closer to where you are writing

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,360
your code so install this extension

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,400
today it's really awesome really

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,290
convenient and now I'm going to go into

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,630
a demo of the remote containers

00:17:54,290 --> 00:18:01,160
extension let's talk remote development

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,590
so we started working on remote

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,600
development extensions inside vs code

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,420
about a year and a half ago so well

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,070
before the impacts of coronavirus and

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,200
the work from home situation that many

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,940
of us are in right now

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,800
back then we were talking to lots of

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,310
developers and seeing more and more of

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,770
them developing remotely we talked to

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:24,140
companies that had like huge mono repos

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,030
that maybe didn't even fit on a laptop

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,669
and so developers would just connect to

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,379
a really huge dev VM

00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,359
and nothing was really on their local

00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:35,029
box and they were able to just deploy

00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,720
changes and fixes with the VM in a

00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,179
couple minutes

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,489
we've also seen more and more that data

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,609
scientists are leveraging really

00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:45,830
specialized VMs that have lots of GPU

00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:48,919
and so that they can you know run

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:52,429
sessions on all their huge data sets and

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:55,820
train all their data so we see that

00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:57,980
remote development is now like the norm

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,539
for many developers and especially given

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,429
our remote work environments we're doing

00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:04,100
a lot of that now so we saw that

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,600
existing remote experiences for

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,450
development or ain't that great maybe

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,720
you are using remote desktop which can

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,330
be a bit laggy or you were SSH into a VM

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,279
and using the terminal and vim so we

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,830
wanted to bring a better development

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,980
experience to the remote environment

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,980
that you were working in so we created

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,499
four key remote extensions to be able to

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,179
work for different scenarios remote

00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:32,539
development inside a virtual machine

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:36,499
inside a container inside WSL and most

00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:38,659
recently inside the browser we wanted

00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,820
you to be able to develop in the context

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,429
of the remote host but still have the

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,489
richness of your vs code experience so

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:49,609
what we did was split the vs code into

00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:52,249
two components into a UI component which

00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:54,710
would run on your local machine and a

00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:57,409
server component which would let you

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,379
edit and run and debug your code on the

00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,929
remote machine basically the vs code

00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,549
server can be run anywhere else and the

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,769
remote extensions would let you

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,739
communicate between vs code and the

00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,960
server so I'm going to show you the

00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:14,179
remote containers extension and this

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,309
lets you develop in docker containers

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,499
which if you really just think about is

00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,409
kind of like another via the power

00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:25,820
really comes from the ability to create

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:29,029
an isolated reusable dev sandbox that

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,859
you can reuse and share with others all

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:34,730
the remote extensions work in a similar

00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:36,889
way so they will install this vs code

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,529
server component in any one of these

00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:41,900
remote contexts so we can search for

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:45,500
this remote development

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:48,560
tensions so if you search for this you

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,470
can see this extension pack which comes

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,170
with all three the remote wsl containers

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,350
and SSH and then you can separately

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,090
search for the extension that lets you

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,550
work inside the browser so this is

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,410
called Visual Studio code spaces I'm

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,960
going to show off containers so when you

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,780
have installed the extension pack it's

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,980
going to contribute an icon to the very

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:16,880
bottom of your window here and we're

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,680
going to try a sample so before I do

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,220
this let's talk a little bit more about

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,500
what is going to happen if you like to

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,780
dabble in projects you know that

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,550
sometimes you have dependency conflicts

00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,010
different packaged versions different

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,290
versions of node or for instance if you

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,660
want to you know clone an an open source

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,430
project and contribute but you realize

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,890
that to be able to build a project you

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,080
need something like rust or C++ I have

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,180
no idea how to install any of that and

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,560
to be honest I don't know if I want to

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,450
because I feel like I'm going to mess up

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,250
my machine or maybe installed the wrong

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,650
compiler or install the wrong package

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,930
manager this happens to a lot of us so

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,240
we wanted to make that easier to work

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,920
with the remote containers extension you

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,070
need to have docker installed and you

00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,050
see I already have it running so let's

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,570
open up my local terminal to see what I

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,820
have on my machine right now open up my

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,920
terminal let's type in to see what

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,810
version of node we have I have an older

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,960
version of node so let's use the remote

00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:16,700
containers extension to help us

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,150
basically create a sandbox where I can

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,650
use a specific version of my tools and

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,170
not actually have to worry about messing

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:29,330
anything up on my local machine so I'm

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:33,530
going to try a sample remote containers

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,590
and I'm going to try the node sample so

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,000
this is going this is a set of

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,040
repositories that we've already built

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,910
for you just to try out what it's like

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,500
to use this it's going to build an image

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,880
but I already built it once so it's just

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,880
going to connect to the container now

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,080
all right so you see here the vs code

00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,440
pretty quickly connected to this

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,690
container you see on the bottom left

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,389
here that I'm inside this dev container

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,850
so let's see what that really means this

00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:11,139
terminal looks a little different all

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,120
right it looks like I'm on a Linux

00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:16,179
terminal I am inside of a new

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,809
environment this is different from my

00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:21,600
local environment I'm on a Mac right now

00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:24,370
let's see what version of node I have

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,419
all right I have any updated version of

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,649
node for me to use so what happened

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,380
instead of running on my local machine

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm now running inside this container

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,679
I'm running vias code inside this docker

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,980
container if you're not familiar with

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,990
docker it's a way for you to encapsulate

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,389
environments from the OS down and then

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,730
lets you build more specific things and

00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:48,730
layers on top of it so the magic here is

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,179
really inside this dev container so I

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:54,490
have this docker file this is a really

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,830
standard docker file I'm not really

00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:00,279
doing anything fancy here vs code also

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,110
doesn't really interfere and get get

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,880
involved here it's just telling docker

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,460
hey go build this and run the container

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,860
so once the container is building then

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,679
we're going to inject a version of the

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,289
vs code server in the container not the

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,059
UI just the vs code server just the

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,240
things that give you language support

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:21,340
debugging support things like that and

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,740
now there's a connection between my

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,460
local client that's running my UI so you

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,350
see here I I still have the same vs code

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,870
theme I had on my local machine so I'm

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,539
running my UI locally but I've connected

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,149
to this container so now the magic is in

00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:40,120
this dev container does JSON this tells

00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:42,250
vs code how to setup my container for me

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,350
to be able to develop like I do locally

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,169
so it's gonna tell it's gonna point it

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,970
to the the docker file I want and it's

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:51,880
going to set settings so I can choose

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,070
that I want a bash terminal inside this

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,889
environment that I want these specific

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,750
extensions I have the es lint extension

00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:00,669
installed so you can see here there's a

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,179
difference between the extensions I have

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:05,440
inside my container and inside my local

00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:08,799
computer

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,860
and they can also list ports to forward

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,720
so that I can connect to them locally so

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,159
let's try running this let's just see

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,970
what happens where this is a standard

00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:21,129
Express app I'm going to open up the

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,169
main file this is just an Express app

00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:26,919
you see I still get a lot of the

00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:28,899
colorization if I wanted to I get you

00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,419
know the the autocomplete things like

00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:34,179
this that I'm used to I can get linting

00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:36,460
I can get errors this is all things that

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:40,809
I can do I can set breakpoints so let's

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,539
just run it f5 see what happens or it's

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,279
running on this local address and I'm

00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:47,620
able to connect to it like how can I

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,529
actually connect to this address from my

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,529
you know local edge browser like this is

00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:55,450
the magic of remote development you saw

00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,220
in the dev container that I set up the

00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,110
ports I wanted to forward you know

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,789
containers are isolated so if I wanted

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,769
to access anything from inside the

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,559
container I needed to forward it so I

00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,360
can access it from my local host so I

00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,730
didn't have to set up anything for this

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,620
to work right we are now in a specific

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,110
environment for me with a specific

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,730
version of my tools I didn't have to set

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,529
anything up besides installing the

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,049
containers extension and having docker

00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,820
installed so this is really really cool

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:24,340
all right like think about all the cases

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,009
of this could be used for it's really

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,559
great for onboarding people that are new

00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:31,149
to your team so you know we all know

00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,669
adding a new engineer to our team is

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,139
expensive they spend two weeks trying to

00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:37,480
figure out how to set up their computer

00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:38,919
you have to teach them how to run you

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,350
know the build tools show them really

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,360
specific things to your team's

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,120
environment but instead you can encode

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,940
this all in a docker file no you don't

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,490
have to spend weeks reading through all

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,960
the giant steps in your readme and you

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,490
don't have to pollute your machine or

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,000
install the wrong version of something

00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:00,580
you just pull any project that has a dev

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,289
container so vs code knows how to

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,779
connect to it and you can just build and

00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:07,779
connect to the container you can also

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,059
specify the vs code set up inside a dev

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:12,730
container this is also really awesome

00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:14,799
for maybe the education scenario think

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,139
about students learning to code in their

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,700
first computer science class so many of

00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:19,210
them get discouraged because they don't

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,880
know how to

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,700
you know install Java and the JDK and

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,190
their IDE at home but if you encapsulate

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,779
all the dependencies and setup inside

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,299
just a docker container that's all they

00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,250
need to know so I really want to thank

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:36,100
everyone for joining us this was an

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,620
awesome awesome event I'm glad you were

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,809
all here at open j/s so install the

00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,850
containers extension installed the

00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,649
github extension give us feedback on

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,630
what else you want to see from vs code

00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:49,860
and I hope you have a great rest of your

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,860
