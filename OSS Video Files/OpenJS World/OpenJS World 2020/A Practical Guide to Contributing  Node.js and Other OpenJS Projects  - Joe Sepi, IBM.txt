ever

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,070
my name is Joseph II and I work for

00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,699
IBM International

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:24,040
this machines we've been around for 100

00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:26,140
some odd years and Counting and I am an

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,220
open source engineer and advocate there

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:34,989
at IBM and I'm very lucky and fortunate

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,269
to have this role where I do the

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,510
majority of my work in the community I

00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:43,750
have worked in the node.js community for

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,540
a number of years and was a part of the

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,879
group who helped merge the J's

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,170
Foundation and the node.js foundation

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,440
into the now open J's Foundation which

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,960
happened a little over a year ago and I

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,809
currently am the chairperson of the

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
cross project Council which is the top

00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:08,289
Technical Advisory Committee within the

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,840
foundation and we work in the CPC the

00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:13,690
cross project Council to you know help

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,360
help projects to be successful whatever

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,560
that means for them and support them

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,630
with infrastructure or security or

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,880
standards or you know code of conduct in

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,320
moderation processes things like these

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,299
I'll also just add real quickly that we

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,790
meet every Tuesday across project

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,439
Council and we have lots of work to do

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,409
if you have any interest in the work

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,380
that we are doing please join us you can

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:44,079
find more information on the open JSF

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,430
dot org site slash collaborate gives you

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,729
links to slack and the github repos and

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,729
and the calendar and a variety of things

00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,590
that may be helpful so you know that's a

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,979
little bit about me let's let's talk

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:04,600
about contributing to open source I want

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:09,340
to mention at the outset that's the kind

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,380
of center of the road here for this

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,680
journey is talking about new

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,110
contributors but I hope that you know

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,090
I'll also raise things that will be

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,540
helpful for maintainer x' or other

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:26,199
seasoned open-source contributors along

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,720
the way as well so to get things started

00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:32,100
I think it makes sense to talk about

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,740
etiquette and kind of how you approach

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,540
open-source and and contributing to or

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,230
repositories in the open-source space I

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,290
know that this can in some instances V

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,030
be very daunting I understand that

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,650
because every time I open up node core

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,470
to get some work done I don't it myself

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,370
so I feel your pain there but so I

00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,040
encourage you to you know once you get

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,320
over that wall it's it's it's easier

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,380
every other time and and I encourage you

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,540
to get started I'll also add that it's

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,840
when you're interacting with folks in

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,700
open source remember to be courteous

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,620
don't be afraid to ask questions always

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,980
assume good intentions I would recommend

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,350
that you take some time to read

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,600
documentation around contributing and

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,470
the processes that are in place for

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,640
contributing to different repositories

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,790
well whether they be you know code style

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,250
linting or commit message format and

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,020
things like that make sure you put a

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,540
little effort upfront so you understand

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,330
what the project is expecting of new

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,740
contributors so that's you have less

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:58,390
friction down the line and I also

00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,790
encourage new contributors to you know

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,680
be open to constructive criticism it's

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,950
sometimes difficult to put code out

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,340
there and have it critiqued in an open

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,080
forum have people commenting on it but

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,209
this is a great way to learn it's really

00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,400
I've found the best way to learn and to

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,620
engage with with with folks around open

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,320
source because there really drives you

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,560
to you know think through things

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,750
thoroughly and to think about edge cases

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,290
and testing and and all these sorts of

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,630
things so remember that's most of the

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,020
people and open-source of humans and you

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,879
should assume good intentions and you

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,409
know just dive in and

00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,740
it's it's typically a good experience so

00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:44,690
I encourage you to to do that similarly

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,740
on the opposite side for maintained errs

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,159
and collaborators in projects remember

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,580
that it is daunting for new contributors

00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:58,099
so be kind be gentle

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,020
remember assume good intentions on on

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,729
both sides right there there are no dumb

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,129
questions let's be courteous to each

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,639
other be sure that you are contributing

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,409
guidelines and the things that go along

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,440
with that are clearly documented like

00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,539
what you expect from commit messages if

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,789
you are particular about that sort of

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:20,330
thing so you know on the opposite side

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,759
just make sure that that things are in

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:29,300
place for contributors to feel welcome

00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:34,460
and feel enabled and are lacking

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,500
blockers to get involved right so one

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,770
place that I would start to encourage

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,080
folks to look at is the community health

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,849
of a project so if you know a particular

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,949
project that you are considering getting

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,800
involved in I recommend you go to that

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,139
repository and you'll notice in the tabs

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,180
along the top there is an insights tab

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,639
and if you click on that there's a

00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,620
community sub tab I guess you'd call it

00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:05,569
and within that community view into the

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,940
project you'll find links to the code of

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,090
conduct contributing guidelines license

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:14,270
you know a few a few metrics that github

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,210
has determined are good indicators of a

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,460
project's health as it relates to the

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,169
community and particularly new

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,060
contributors so those are some important

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,229
things to check out of course you'll

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,300
want to look at the license and make

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:28,639
sure that that's that works for you and

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,389
if you're unsure about license ease

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,719
lysed licenses choose a licensed org I

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,919
think it is is a great resource for

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,580
learning more about the different types

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,400
of licenses and

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,139
what they mean as I've mentioned

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,610
checkout contributing guidelines and

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,800
such which are referenced in the

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,689
community health view there but probably

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,030
most importantly the the first place

00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,860
that I would go and look is the code of

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,560
conduct so make sure that there is a

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,789
code of conduct in place make sure that

00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,520
you are comfortable with it to make sure

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:02,639
that it is extensive enough that's that

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,710
it covers you know the different areas

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,689
that you may be concerned with there is

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,930
a contributors covenant that's a lot of

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,460
projects use and that that's great a lot

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,860
of folks have have landed on that I know

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,699
that there are a couple others but

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,440
definitely just make sure that something

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,479
like that is in place so there there

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,000
aren't any issues down the road I think

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,610
having a good code of conduct is a good

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,530
indicator that the project takes these

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,740
sorts of things seriously and is

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,180
welcoming to new contributors and I

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,330
would also on the flip side again

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,759
encourage maintainer z' and

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:38,639
collaborators to also view this page and

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,250
see how your repository stacks up there

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,120
I'll mention that if you go and look at

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,659
github comm slash nodejs slash node and

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,469
look at the community health profile

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,270
it's in pretty good shape

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,900
the I mean I think it's actually in

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,330
great shape there is it looks like it's

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,759
saying that the code of conduct I

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,110
believe is so the code of conduct or is

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,599
it the contributing maybe the

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,580
contributing guidelines are not fully in

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,580
place but if you click through to it

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,089
you'll actually find that the nodejs

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:17,669
project through its years of work has

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:20,879
really developed robust processes and

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:24,319
guidelines around things like code of

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,139
conduct and moderation and contributing

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:32,279
the documentation there is very well

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,570
fleshed out and I think that you should

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,699
find that very helpful and very

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,440
encouraging these are things that we've

00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:40,589
been working on for a long time so if

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,000
the community health profile you know

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,589
looks a little lacking just make sure to

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,370
click through and and and you know

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,380
double check for yourself

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:54,520
that the computers have got everything

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:56,190
correctly so moving on from from well

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,310
you know let me let me say actually I

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,980
wanted to also highlight this neat trick

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,220
that's I found someone posted on on

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,000
Twitter a few months ago perhaps that if

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,860
you go to a repository say for example

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,730
nodejs slash node which is the node core

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,550
repo

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,920
if you append slash contributes to any

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,310
repository it takes you to this really

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,470
interesting view that it appears to

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,160
collects all of the good first issue

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,740
labeled

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,730
issues but it also goes a step further

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,110
and I believe tries to algorithmically

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,570
determine other issues that may be

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,190
potentially good first issues and I

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,830
suspect that there's there are some like

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,050
documentation issues in there I don't

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,790
know how it does it but it seems like it

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,580
tries to pull out issues that it thinks

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,470
would be good good first issues even if

00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,350
they don't specifically have that label

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,100
on them so that's a neat trick

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:56,170
definitely check that out there's also a

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,200
link there for the contributing doc

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,660
directly from that from that view so

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,630
it's a really great place to get started

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,370
and again I'll mention to maintain errs

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,700
and collaborators who also go to that

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:14,110
page and see what your project looks

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,170
like in that view so moving on we have

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,110
talked about the process that a project

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,640
may have in place to contribute and

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,089
you'll definitely want to spend some

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,880
time going through the this

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:32,170
documentation so that you can be

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,430
successful in your contributions so you

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,640
know I think we've mentioned a couple

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,890
times now like get commit messages some

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,350
larger projects are very particular

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:47,290
about how you may format these messages

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,570
code style guide documentation style

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,670
guide there are a number of things that

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,750
you'll want to just make sure you're

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,579
aware of at the very least

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,230
may want to reference again before you

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,720
open your first poll request that you

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,079
are in line with with what is expected

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,439
and I did notice today that's from the

00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,850
node contributing guidelines there's

00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:10,160
this really helpful paragraph that says

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,779
and I'll read this directly if you are

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,819
new to contributing to node.js

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,189
please try to do your best at conforming

00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:18,199
to these guidelines but do not worry if

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,970
you get something wrong one of the

00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,649
existing contributors will help get

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,480
things situated and the contributor

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,399
landing the pull request will ensure

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,819
that everything follows the project's

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:32,300
guidelines so these are guidelines that

00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:34,129
are in place but you know don't feel

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,689
like it's such a barrier that you won't

00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,529
get involved because there are people

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:41,980
there that can help you now another

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,720
thing to be mindful of are any

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,220
prerequisites that may exist for

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,920
projects you know node has some when you

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,959
first get started and you are running

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,379
node locally there are some things you

00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:01,149
need to be aware of and this can be

00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:04,430
tooling this can be like underlying

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:07,490
dependencies but also it could be like

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,180
concepts so for example es lint which is

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:14,959
another open JS foundation project it's

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,959
largely based on the ast the abstract

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,480
syntax tree and so having a good

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,240
understanding of how that works

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,250
will be beneficial to you getting

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,920
involved in a project like that so there

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:32,170
may be some upfront learning that you

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,129
may want to do depending on the project

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,939
so now I'd like to take a moment and

00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:40,519
talk about like the typical github open

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:44,360
source contributing flow and what that

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:49,519
looks like and it's it's basically you

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:52,959
know fork clone set your upstream branch

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,490
make changes add those changes commit

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,220
create a pull request so that's kind of

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,640
the TLDR really quickly but I'll just go

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,579
into each of those

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,310
for a moment for folks that are new to

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,690
this process so you'll go to the

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,680
repository that you're interested in so

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:15,779
say no js' slash node and from there you

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:18,899
can fork that repository to your own you

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,690
know your own account on on github from

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:26,060
there you'll want to get the git link or

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:29,790
the HTTP link and clone it locally

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,170
you'll CD into that directory and the

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,060
first thing that I do is I check the

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:39,750
remotes I use hub which is a github CLI

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:43,079
tool and so I just type git remotes but

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,290
I think like get remote LS I can

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,670
remember exactly but you can see which

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,709
remotes are attached to your repository

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,880
when you first clone it it should just

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:55,950
have the origin set to your your your

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,769
git repository so the first thing you

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:02,910
want to do is do git remote add upstream

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:06,980
and set that to the upstream repository

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:09,510
so node.js slash node in this instance

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,560
if you don't have git configured

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,829
correctly you'll want to add your

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,190
username and your email with git config

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:20,190
username and the value and get config

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,899
you sort out email and the value so

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,980
there's a couple of ways to get things

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,930
set up it's it's best practice to create

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,769
a branch when you're contributing to an

00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,390
open source repository and this way you

00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,550
know if you have a couple of different

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,260
pull requests that may be open they

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,760
don't step on each other right so if you

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,459
keep everything in a branch you can work

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,019
on that branch and know that's the next

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,269
pull request you open isn't going to

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,380
include these other changes and muddy

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:52,110
the waters so always use branches you'll

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,029
basically do your work the changes that

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,980
you want to make and then you'll get add

00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,860
the files that you're gonna include in

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:03,000
this commit and I'll say really quickly

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:05,130
that it's best to keep your changes to a

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,640
small set that is focused on a

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:12,740
particular issue try to avoid larger

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,760
requests that may touch on a variety of

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,520
things you want to definitely keep it as

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,870
you know as tightly knit as possible as

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,280
small and focused as possible so once

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,980
you make your changes you'll add those

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,470
files get commit I'm sorry get add and

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,270
then your files or get add period is

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,880
what I usually use when when I'm just

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,100
focused on one little thing in a branch

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,380
get commit I typically add my commit

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,290
message in line whatever works for you

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,640
and then you'll get push origin your

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,880
branch right so that's kind of the

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,370
typical flow get your repository local

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,410
make your changes get add git commit git

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,670
push with a project that has a lot of

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,870
moving parts a lot of things changing

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:03,080
you may also want to get rebase your

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,820
changes from upstream so that when you

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,650
create your pull request it's in sync

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,470
with what is the latest and you may need

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:12,800
to do that on an ongoing basis basis

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,450
while your pull request is open but you

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,910
can do that with git fetch all get

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:22,520
rebase upstream master and then get push

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:25,820
force or force with lease a note that's

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,020
while rebase is is my friend i think it

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,880
should be your friend to you but you

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,130
need to be aware that when you push

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,080
something with with force it rewrites

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,630
history so it can be dangerous but you

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,460
know just use it wisely I use it all the

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:44,210
time so that's kind of the typical flow

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,310
I within that tool that I mentioned

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,870
earlier hub you can create a pull

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:52,450
request directly from the command line

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:55,850
and you know it's a simple it's a good

00:16:52,450 --> 00:17:00,080
workflow to to be using when you're

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,500
contributing to open source but I wanted

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,510
to highlight that's not all

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,640
contributions are code right there are a

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,199
number of ways to contribute to open

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,680
source projects and I think that this is

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,170
important to call out so just in general

00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,900
documentation is always a good place to

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:23,610
to get involved in fact when a few

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,850
months ago I was working on at Gatsby

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,079
site and I found some discrepancies some

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,290
things that weren't particularly clear

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,059
to me and I just went and clone the repo

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,300
brought it down and created a pull

00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,220
request and the gentleman that leads

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,020
that project his name is escaping now is

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,820
was really very courteous very

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,250
appreciative and I was happy to

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,100
contribute a really good experience

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,770
there so that docks are great if you

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,040
have interest in building websites you

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,940
know a website for the for the project

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,440
may be in place and you can help their

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,830
project management frankly is something

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,400
that is always needed in an open source

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:10,590
repository and then there could be other

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:14,030
things like social media community

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,030
outreach those sorts of things

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,740
and I'll touch on that more in a moment

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,570
I'll just also add to that with with

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,330
projects like node-red which is another

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,150
open J's foundation project you can

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,450
contribute nodes to the programming

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:33,990
interface loopback is another open

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:36,660
source project that I've contributed the

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,750
datasource connectors to and done work

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,160
outside of core that that's helpful so

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,620
there are a number of ways that you can

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,970
contribute that aren't just the core

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:50,490
code or even code and at all so another

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,820
few ways that you can do that with a

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:57,510
node is that we have these concepts of

00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,090
initiatives and teams and working groups

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,640
so so some examples are the the release

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,580
team which involves code for sure

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,600
because you're you may be back porting

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,309
some things to different release lines

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,679
but but but that's always a very active

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,080
team that that's you can get involved

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,890
with the build working group is another

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,170
team with a node there is a website

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,290
redesign team that's been active for a

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:28,830
while and that's a great place to get

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,720
involved too for a node you're writing

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,240
more kind of front-end code for the

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,700
website internationalization is another

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,840
great place there's there are not only

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,330
the

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,179
translations that are needed but also

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,190
the underlying work that supports the

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,440
translation effort the the

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,940
internationalization efforts so those

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,860
are those are a couple of good places

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,220
and then I mentioned in social community

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,230
outreach node has a newly formed social

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,520
team also there'll be a group of us that

00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:02,429
are actually managing the social media

00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,809
presence there's you know in the past

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,480
have been community and outreach

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:09,059
programs as well that are that are great

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,820
ways to get involved and then there's a

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,520
new initiative recently started for

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:18,149
examples so good straightforward simple

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,549
examples for a lot of common use cases

00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:23,190
so that's another place that's we'd love

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,070
some more contributions and speaking of

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,940
of all these things I want to mention

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,620
that the collaborator summit has been

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,360
was on Monday and is happening again on

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,840
Thursday and Friday so that's another

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,669
great place to to get involved in open

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,850
source and the work that we're doing in

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:45,570
the foundation and such so a lot of

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:48,539
people will ask me you know how do I how

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,190
does one get their company to get more

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,140
involved in open source and as I

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,970
mentioned at the beginning you know iBM

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,210
is very supportive of my work and open

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,770
source and Allah we have a lot of folks

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,950
in IBM that are working almost

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,630
exclusively on an open source but I've

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,510
worked in a variety of other companies

00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:10,409
where you know it was a little bit more

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:13,110
of a struggle to get company time to be

00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:14,640
involved in open source and there is an

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,149
initiative called open source Fridays

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,730
that I think is maybe started by github

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:22,770
it's a good website that that kind of is

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,539
helpful in trying to do more of the

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,899
stuff and particularly like dedicating

00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:29,549
Fridays to it what I found successful at

00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,580
my time at Behance

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:34,950
and Adobe was that we were doing a lot

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,679
of work in open source we relied on a

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,789
lot of open source tooling and so we

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,399
took the friday approach but we

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:46,320
alternated between one Friday would be

00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:48,740
like we would call it a bug bash and we

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,770
would just try to clear out you know

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,670
in our in our backlog we wouldn't focus

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:59,090
on sprint work and feature work we would

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,190
just try to knock out bugs and then the

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,020
other Friday we would alternate would be

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,240
an open source Friday so you know one

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,150
Friday's bug bash next Friday's open

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,980
source bug bash open source and so that

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,720
was a really great like kind of

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,390
middle-ground compromise that I think

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,200
could work for a variety of development

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:20,440
teams so you may want to consider that

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:24,740
I'll also point out a couple more

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:27,260
resources for getting started in open

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,150
source there's the great for new

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,200
contributors showcase that that github

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,610
has there's the open source guide which

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,800
is great it has a whole how to

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,020
contribute section there's also a

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,050
first-timers only website that's a good

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,490
resource as well and then I'll do a

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,030
little shameless plug as well I've

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:50,179
started in open office hours bi-weekly

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,220
meeting for the open J's foundation and

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,730
we meet every other week and sometimes

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,830
it's just the open office hours on a few

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,050
occasions we brought in project

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,130
maintainers someone from Express yes

00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:05,809
lint internationalization and nodejs we

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,200
have a few more that were lining up

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,730
after the event and that's a I think a

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,530
really good place for folks to come and

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,380
ask questions and to learn about how to

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:19,460
get involved in particular projects so

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:23,270
if you go to github.com slash open Jas -

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,929
foundation slash open - office - hours

you can see more there and that's my

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,570
talk I hope that's you all get involved

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,660
in open source and I hope that it's a

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,240
really great experience for you and my
