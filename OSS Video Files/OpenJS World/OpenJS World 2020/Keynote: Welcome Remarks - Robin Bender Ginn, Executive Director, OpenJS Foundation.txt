to give a thank you to all of our

witness anything please give our team a

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,660
shout at open joyous events at linux

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,860
foundation org or a DM on twitter at

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,460
open JSF you know this week is a special

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,809
one five full days of JavaScript the

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,820
community is coming together through

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,500
collab summit in the conference to

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,039
discuss the past the present in the

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,710
future 25 years since it was created but

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,590
it's you know also today is really a

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,229
historic time we're living through a

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,420
global pandemic that's really impacting

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,240
many of those that we love and it's made

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,720
us all change the way that we go about

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,640
our daily lives and it's also a time

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,340
that I believe is just long overdue

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,830
where the fight for equality and justice

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,290
is finally being recognized and heard

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,450
you know I am optimistic that things

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,119
will change and get better but I am

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,740
optimistic without ignoring the

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,159
experiences and the realities of

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,659
underrepresented communities today

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,170
there's still so much to learn and

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,990
actions to take to overcome bias so you

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,420
know this week I hope that open j/s is a

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,060
place that you'll find a tech home and a

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,280
sense of community where you can think

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,770
about you know how can I make history

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,869
with technology not only in what you

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:03,600
build but in how you build with others

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:06,570
through open source urban 90s for me

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,849
growing up in Seattle it was a decade of

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,200
grunge music it was also a banner year

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,860
for the tech industry

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,110
Larry met Sergey at Stanford were they

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,720
created a web crawler project that later

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,880
became Google Amazon shipped its first

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,180
book which interesting enough was on the

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,440
topic of computer mount modeling and

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,930
Microsoft launched windows 95 and

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,860
Internet Explorer leading to fierce

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:33,320
competition in the browser space and the

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,130
news that also hit that year was the

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,720
birth of JavaScript in 1995 javascript

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,940
and sun announced the creation of

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,160
javascript an open source cross-platform

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,770
language for enterprise networks in the

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,750
internet and we are really fortunate to

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,650
have Ellen wharfs proct here this week

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,810
to share more about its history so today

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,520
you know javascript is now the top

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,500
training programming language in the

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,070
world and you know many people are

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,340
surprised to learn that over 96% of the

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:06,140
world's websites depend on JavaScript so

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,250
most people are using javascript whether

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,060
they know it or not

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,720
and today the open J's foundation is

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,750
here to be the home in neutral home to

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,940
grow the JavaScript and web ecosystem if

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,860
you didn't know we were created by the

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,350
merger of the nodejs and the Jas

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,360
foundations about a year ago and I like

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,459
to say that we're new but we've taken

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,360
the best of both worlds and adopted what

00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,100
works so you know we just knew and know

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,799
that working together in an independent

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,010
foundation we can work together to keep

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,739
JavaScript safe and modern and we do

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,049
this a number of ways and really our

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,600
goal is to really promote the adoption

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,790
and continued development of key

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,920
technologies and we do this through open

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,540
governance and I'll explain a little bit

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,320
about how that comes together and how

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,450
all of you can get involved but first

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,239
let me give you a quick overview of our

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,959
projects the open J's foundation hosts

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,810
over 30 important open-source JavaScript

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,049
projects including appium dojo jQuery

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,700
nodejs a web pack and Wow they are so

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,920
busy all of the time and I wish I could

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,810
just share all of this all of the great

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,660
highlights but you know we had webdriver

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:25,220
shipping v6 dojo shipping these seven

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,210
nodejs shipping v14 gosh we launched a

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,190
node.js training

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,830
certification program a partnership with

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,660
notes arson near forum man and these

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,539
certifications they've just really been

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,660
a great way for developers to showcase

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:41,150
their talent and for companies to find

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,860
great talent in the job market I mean my

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,539
list can go on and on but you know

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,520
you're in luck because many of these

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,690
community leaders are here this week and

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,460
they're going to be sharing many more

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,470
highlights throughout the week so we

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,419
have new projects that open jeaious and

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,520
new projects start as incubation

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,110
projects and what they do is go through

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,479
an onboarding checklist to ready

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,970
themselves to join the foundation and we

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,650
welcome some pretty awesome incubation

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,430
projects since we opened our doors last

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:14,120
year including amp electron FASTA file

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,830
nvm we have a couple of project leaders

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,539
keynoting today to share some news and

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,970
truly our foundation could not survive

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:26,270
without our members members like Google

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,000
IBM giant Microsoft GoDaddy and more

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,949
they really make it happen if I put not

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,409
only providing the financial support to

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:37,250
fund our programs but playing an active

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,169
role in the governance process so you

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,820
know if you rely on our JavaScript

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,740
projects we would love to have your

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,199
company join us a member we have so many

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,090
growing needs to expand our programs and

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,310
support the infrastructure for many of

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:54,260
the projects that you all rely on so

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,880
what has open governance you know I'd

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,159
like to say open governance is kind of

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,860
like a manual for how projects operate

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:04,190
and how decisions are made but all in a

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,750
clear and transparent way and this open

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,539
governance it really creates this

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,039
positive place for collaboration by

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,680
setting a little structure and

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,110
accountability in the process and at the

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,259
open J's foundation since we are in a

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,060
Brella organization a big goal of ours

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,310
was to create a governance model

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,759
designed to give a strong voice to our

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,620
projects so for example each project has

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,990
its own technical steering committee and

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,360
a variety of business and community

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,770
working teams to really manage their

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,419
projects and then at the board or at the

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,370
foundation level we have our board of

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,160
directors who sets our

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,729
and direction are crossed Project

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,889
Council which is like a centralized

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,229
technical advisory and moderation team

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,380
and we have our staff that provides a

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:57,830
number of functions from marketing legal

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,050
and events like you'll see this week and

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,870
so really we want all of our projects to

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,150
operate independently while at the same

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,949
time sort of at that foundation level we

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,100
can kind of remove some of that friction

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:12,500
to allow you to work more quickly and

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,300
work more quickly with the community and

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,570
code and so one other cool thing is most

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,100
of our meetings that open jeaious are

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,740
broadcast live on YouTube and then

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,770
documented on github and you're enjoy

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,350
invited to join so you could simply just

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,000
tune in as an observer or you can just

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,490
jump right in and share your ideas and

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,410
input and if the time doesn't work for

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,449
you you can go to our YouTube channel

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,669
and check it out and go to github and

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,590
check out our notes so lots of ways for

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,010
you to get involved go to our

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,020
collaboration page on open JSF org and

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,520
you can add our meetings to your

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,020
calendar so a lot of people ask us like

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,870
just why don't you just put your

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,479
projects on github and call it a day so

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,950
you know we we know that neutrality is

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,169
important

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,710
so whenever a piece of technology is so

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,410
important you don't want one company to

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,419
control that so moving a piece of

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,320
technology to a foundation is sort of a

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:17,780
way to ensure that the future direction

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,539
of the project has really developed in a

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,910
community way so just take a look at how

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,919
some of the foundations today have

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:29,570
supported connect technologies over time

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:31,130
including Linux Eclipse and dotnet so if

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,589
you know you really want to build a

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,020
truly neutral organization and maybe

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,479
offload some of that non development

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,849
aspects of running a project the open

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,950
J's foundation is really the place to be

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:47,930
because you know everything we do

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,560
supports this so again we have a great

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,839
week

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,900
you'll have the opportunity to engage

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,200
with inspiring speakers who have simply

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,530
been

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,600
unstoppable in reaching their dreams so
