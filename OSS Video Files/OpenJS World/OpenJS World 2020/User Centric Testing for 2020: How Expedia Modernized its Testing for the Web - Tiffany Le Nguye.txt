all right Katalin scientifically I hope

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,280
that the weather is good to you ever you

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,119
are I'm going to be talking today about

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,369
user centric testing and how expedient

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,380
group specifically was able to build a

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,920
testing pipeline that is resilient to

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,150
change

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,429
so in expedient group we have thousands

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,099
of developers and millions of users

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,410
every day our changes have to be

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,469
airtight easily we're factorable and

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,870
consistent to use in the world all over

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,540
the year at the north and skeeter around

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,030
for the past two years now I was it was

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,820
built a user centric testing suite that

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,860
is now the standard at Expedia I wanted

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,270
to share how you could also build one

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,730
following a lot of the philosophies that

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,699
we've adopted in person thing web

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,480
interactions are quite complex

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,539
accessibility is a priority especially

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,700
if you're a company that wants to follow

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,580
accessibility guidelines and legal

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,850
guidelines and performance is essential

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,490
as well um updates also will always keep

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,320
us on our toes make certain libraries

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,090
how point have confidence that these

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,369
changes won't cause unwanted side

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,650
effects while minimally burdening deaths

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,290
so that they can move on for word and

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,390
make new things I want to walk through

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,640
of a modern and and testing suite which

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,030
puts users first for a maintainable and

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,220
scalable code base at the end of this

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,930
you should be able to identify who your

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,880
users are and test for their individual

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,790
needs while balancing cost and

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,409
confidence in your systems it's also to

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,100
be noted that the text used within

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,750
Expedia are

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,000
we presented our specific but the

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,740
philosophies can be used for which other

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,710
testing frameworks that you have in

00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:01,330
place so that that sound annoyed maybe a

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:05,259
little bit into a little bit of an intro

00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,570
on me so I took me and I am an engineer

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,390
at Expedia group and also any speaker

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,989
yeah and I've been an engineer there for

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,270
maybe the past two years and I work

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,370
mainly on the UI platform teams there

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,970
and also on building my new page of the

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,360
syllabus that you look up when you are

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,590
googling top ten hotels of man so I am

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,709
also a mentor for a fika camera and I

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,360
wanted to founders technically a

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:39,310
starship but I'm not ready to get that

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,810
rest and that's about that's about it

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,180
for me if you want to follow me or see

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,459
what I'm up to you and I'm super active

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:51,910
on Twitter but one day it could be so

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:55,060
you can find families all right let's go

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,570
into what a good testing pipeline is for

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,400
us again testing Python is one that

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,000
captures unintended changes affecting

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,070
your users it's also one that gives you

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,489
confidence that production won't break

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:13,390
with new changes does promoting a

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,299
culture of quality and finally one that

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,130
provides quick and effective feedback to

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:19,780
your developers this means that when

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,299
something breaks you want to be

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,109
immediate into knowing why that happened

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,220
and immediate into how to fix it that's

00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:31,959
all a little bit more into what this

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,970
means here we have a wizard or the

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,939
typical place that you would find

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,579
yourself if you were looking

00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:43,560
you would call this wizard put in a few

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:45,269
dates put in a few of the rooms and

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,260
guests that you wanted and then he was

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:51,629
search or poverty can't me have a test

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,189
that was able to cash that something has

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:58,129
changed on the page for our beautiful

00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,659
natural man bent bend national park

00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:03,180
image for the place with one of the

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,040
screen on frog this is something that

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,349
might affect the user maybe they don't

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,470
wanna be searching for a tiny more in a

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,840
place that has screaming frogs so this

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,060
is this this is a little bit debatable

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,979
but other examples would be for if

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,440
freaking out what the date picker did

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,419
allow you to input your dates or if the

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,560
header find hotels near banff national

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,419
park Alberta has either changed or

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,330
didn't show certain things that are

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,990
actually impacted the user experience so

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:39,060
we want to catch this here's an example

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:41,849
of initially the same page but now we

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,740
see that it was actually am each one

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:50,010
wrapped with a dip for a dis dis heading

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,750
and then there was a change made by the

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,520
developer and what he did is they just

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,710
removed the div because they saw was her

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,409
then there was no change that was

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,530
visible or affecting the user however

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:04,110
the test still broke this is a bad catch

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,169
its fragile and noise developers and

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,880
discourage refactoring with this and

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,800
it's

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,140
this is the same for if you were to

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,690
check for class names or the internal

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,070
workings in the view some prop dad and

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,310
it doesn't actually affect the way that

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:25,580
your component is being interacted with

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:28,040
a lot of this follows a philosophy of

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,950
testing us who a lot of you may know as

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,590
the creator of test testing library or

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,950
we have testing library and also a

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,170
phenomenal speaker so he tweeted out

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,060
saying Des Moines your tests resembled a

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,120
way to yourself where it's used to more

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,040
confidence to give me and this is a

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,170
philosophy that I want you all to keep

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,940
deep in your hearts because it's the one

00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:56,210
that just one to be following us all

00:05:49,940 --> 00:06:00,730
throughout this pipeline so Freud see

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,080
you as I said before Expedia is home to

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,100
a billion-dollar industry

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,180
with millions and millions of dollars so

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,160
we're always looking changes we're

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,540
always refactoring and we want things to

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,080
be consistent and of course not brick so

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,970
let's take again our page our data

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,780
analysts have found out that actually

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,390
screaming fox have brought more users

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,250
and so we're going to keep that we still

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,290
have again the wizard where you can

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,330
enter your check of these checkout days

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,860
and your guests and search as well as

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,860
some miscellaneous links

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,660
all right so who would you say are the

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:50,250
users of this page with this wizard they

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,380
are all of our customers so this is

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,330
anyone that wants to come in they're

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,200
gonna wanna search and enter your dates

00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,270
and search for properties no matter how

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,170
what kind of accessibility needs that

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,070
they may have if you need any any more

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:11,010
reasons to handle accessibility use

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,460
cases and follow the accessibility

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:16,770
guidelines under dentist to do there is

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,880
of course a lot of data showing that

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:27,230
it's actually good business-wise to to

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:31,160
handle and support these these customers

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:34,500
then we have data analysts these are

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,560
people that are not really our customers

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,180
but they are going to see what are the

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,950
recommends of the customer to defoe

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,870
making sure that our pages winning

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,420
properly and seeing if there's any any

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,420
anything that we can make better and

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,920
finally we have our boss these people

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,500
these are the people rather than on

00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,260
people that are going to be coming to

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,990
our pages and giving us a score making

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,760
sure that we have good rankings and

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,130
we're following all the proper carcasses

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,160
as well what they want is good metadata

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,420
performance and accessibility this is

00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
very important to us I just video

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,990
because we want to make sure that we are

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:23,040
recognized possible search engines okay

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,450
not into the brass tacks we have here

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,730
the pike when does most common expedient

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,669
initially we start with static checks so

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:36,690
things are any checks that are running

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,690
while you're programming or well while

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,539
you're programming or

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,090
before you're you're clicking code such

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,890
as if you're having tech script or any

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,140
lenders that would make sure that you're

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,920
catching any really cunning mistakes

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,810
for example forgetting to use forgetting

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,980
to initialize a variable before using it

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:59,920
and before you push your code then as

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,230
you go up into the pipeline once you

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,180
submit at Flores then you jump into a

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:09,910
lot of tests that we wouldn't run in

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:12,910
parallel we have here the adventists and

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,380
sorry the Union and integration tests

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,880
the eat hack attacks with antennae

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,340
visual regression tests with critical

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,650
flows or froman's and accessibility

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,150
tests with White House and then that

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,360
ends up getting deployed into

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:31,930
non-breaking smoke tests with which will

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,200
test for extremely critical flows across

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:39,040
device test and then cross device and

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:44,320
browse their tests keep in mind that

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:48,760
there is a serving performance at hand

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,360
keep in mind at the top really really

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,090
fast

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,470
you have community region tests which

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,290
you don't need to be running an entire

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,300
application to run your tests then you

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,680
have the intent test which are actually

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,240
building rendering and then going on an

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,550
actual browser in order to test your

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,050
application which of course is slower

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,960
Sigma synchronous and can also be a

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,150
little bit flaky here as well there's no

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,150
regression test which will actually take

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:22,839
screenshots of your page and compare

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,080
them compare them to different versions

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,390
that you had before

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,010
and finally you have performance and

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,830
accessibility tests as well as any other

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,450
tricks that you might have these depend

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,340
but for performance of it says

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,780
tests that we use in it's quite slow

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,940
because you are again having to run your

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,860
application and run DS lakehouse for

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,270
performance a sensibility tests on each

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,970
one and it has to go through the entire

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,520
Dom we're going to talk about this a

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:53,980
little bit more well a lot more detail

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:57,870
in the following slides so I want to

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,220
make sure that we are covering the cost

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,860
versus how much confidence we can get

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,300
from each stage of testing it's hard to

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,720
know where we can float where should we

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,640
focus our kite as well as to make sure

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,970
we're balancing the cost of the test

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,470
versus that confidence it gives us when

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,530
you're going as you can see as you can

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,870
see from the previous graph as you go

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,880
more into testing delete a user with an

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,850
actual device and how do an interactive

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,410
the page then you get into something

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,270
that gives you more confidence but it's

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,060
also much slower and more expensive

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,920
expensive can be monetary but it also

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,420
means that it's something that will

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,110
cause people were developers a lot of

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,020
time so the very very top we have device

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:45,100
which is actually running on a real real

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:51,190
devices at the time or it's going to be

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:57,370
running on selenium and and it's going

00:11:51,190 --> 00:12:00,850
to be a visual test again another quite

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,350
slow and M tests and then you see in the

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,800
middle bracket where we have most of our

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,690
tests visit duration it's a little bit

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,160
hard to define what integration what our

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,960
unit is and what an integration is

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:18,430
inside of UI code in most cases we try

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,410
to avoid those terms and kind of decide

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,480
your functional tests or they're allowed

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:28,000
to creation tests but there is of course

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:30,340
use cases for two or unit tests and then

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,990
we go to muna static tracks as well

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,070
which do cover a lot of these pieces so

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,100
those are things that you want to in

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,830
mind when

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,180
pipeline of what it is actually going to

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,620
cost you to add these tests and where

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,960
you should put them you always want to

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:53,300
have more confidence over coverage as

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,630
well all right let's go into the unit

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,060
test

00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:02,630
hey so we use just testing library with

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,700
the react one and just on exciting

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,770
second if you're starting from scratch I

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,230
would definitely recommend using testing

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,150
library which is favorite agnostic and

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,370
naturally encompasses the best practice

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,410
that's talked about here if you cannot

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,120
change your tools then trying to be mind

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,240
that user centric the lots of use been

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,800
talking about here and go forth with

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,810
what you have so if you're from units

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,940
best for example this would be checking

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,070
the input label and all image start

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,030
inside the document and in fact I was

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,940
getting set as well as overseas for

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,850
example taking a hint out the wizard oh

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,790
we had beforehand we can check that the

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,940
inputs and the images are on the Dom by

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,250
checking dental a was there or checking

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,420
and also tracking down our image to

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,190
screaming frog is there by its alt text

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,410
another example would be checking data

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,390
track events or second click sorties

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,080
number one here we are going to get the

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,660
button by the search then by its text

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,870
search and we're gonna click on it and

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,870
then once that's done we are just going

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,490
to check that it has been called the

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,030
track events half and cone with the

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,440
proper earnings other examples would be

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,260
checking air states from that customer

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,920
input and by care responses if you want

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,560
to cover

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,960
SEO in here and have metadata as you can

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,480
also check that or check that

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,040
and the public tags exist as well if you

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,940
wanted to do this here in the White

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,390
House stage as you can see here these

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,340
are pretty good at covering and

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,810
accessibility guidelines of course not

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,420
everything can be covered by this but

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:47,420
the fact that there's not really better

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,870
way to be testing this other than using

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,360
the actual alt text or a label text

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,790
insurance that you are actually using

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,570
those well during your development which

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:02,600
is great it makes it so that excessively

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,090
you know not an act of God and it is

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,200
something that your developers can get

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:13,010
used to as well other examples would

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,560
also be entering dates yes anything here

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,060
really is where you would have too many

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:23,210
different experiences that your user

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:25,820
would have as much as you can really and

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,710
we have end-to-end tests and that's when

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,080
you're actually building in running app

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:33,290
locally or in a CI a-- and interacting

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,000
with the page to a user so this would be

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,530
for example with entering dates and

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,210
searching and making sure it goes to the

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:42,920
proper URL again and on tests are quite

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,080
slow everything's happening the secret

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,500
and synchronously because it has to wait

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,630
until you have to wait if for something

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,100
to appear before but for most of the

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,990
time for example if you're clicking but

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,520
no it's a bad log you should wait until

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,100
the dialog appears before building that

00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,220
test that's why the only we'll really

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,200
want for a happy past and we use Cypress

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,340
because it acts the least like a black

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,320
box and runs on an actual browser we

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,150
also use Cypress testing library for

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,830
additional service commands that would

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:17,150
match the adjustments that I showed

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:19,640
previously let's go into an example in

00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,750
here we are going to be doing what I

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,120
just said

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,699
we're going to find a check-in and

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,980
checkout dates and your arts and click

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,629
on December and then make sure your diet

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,230
gets some of us to de crédito raw wood a

00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,959
quick correct query pounds what we do

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,079
here is some tax very feminine familiar

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:42,139
to the last line we defined illegal tax

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:45,560
attractive and then we type in June 23rd

00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:50,060
money then we go and we find check out

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:52,129
but and then we type June 24 2012 after

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,649
that some psycho Cypress is running

00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:58,069
sickness ly we know that these tasks

00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,009
have been done and we can click send by

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:02,959
finding the button and clicking it once

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:07,309
they've done that it's going to check

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,530
that the path name and massage has been

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:13,189
changed correctly so that it has gone to

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:15,199
a different URL that has hotel search in

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,439
this in this case and was given the

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,480
proper check-in and check-out date

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,039
it's all very human readable and very

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:29,270
easy to go through and see how it is

00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:33,039
that broke as well I want to show here

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,570
an example of how Cyprus would be run

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,770
let's wait a little bit until this

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,770
person who's done writing your test

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:55,710
there you go you can see it that you can

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,570
see that it was able to read its test

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,600
maybe go visit to a page and then actual

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,100
browser will be open for you to

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,960
interactive this is for development

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,120
purposes it makes it very easy to be by

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,640
the visitors a console that you can

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,390
interact with as well and it shows you

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,970
step by step the test running and what

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,980
happens once it gets to each each step

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,170
in this case it went in and went we were

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,000
out and found some inputs typed in it

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,000
and made sure that the bottoms changed

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,080
don't have visual regressions most

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,470
smaller applications don't need this so

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,670
that's something to keep in mind it's

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,200
useful when you have external UI

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:45,600
libraries and when you have applications

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,310
that you do really want to check any UI

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,680
changes that might have cosmic side

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,620
effects for doesn't know a visual

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,730
regression test is one that compares the

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,290
base image to a new image taken once

00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,640
changes have been made and make sure

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,030
that never no differences between them

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,850
in this reference so we have we have as

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,150
page that says welcome to updog with the

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:13,140
dot then once there was a change to

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,810
change each dog to a candy cane this

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,970
image was taken showing where were two

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,400
pixels that change we're pretty sure

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,700
that the app did not mean to change the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:30,139
dog dog into it

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:31,879
and now we know that that did happen and

00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:35,029
visual art fashion is really making sure

00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:37,039
that those those unintended side effects

00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,929
are intentional and not just having

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,210
updated a library and maybe not

00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:45,169
realizing that it propagated to some

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,749
little page down below we use Cypress

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:49,759
again 14 the screenshots and we use

00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:51,529
Cypress screenshot discs for matching

00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,919
speed shots and emotion running visual

00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,389
disks

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,190
there are a lot of different tools that

00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:57,919
you can use for this but we use sacred

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,710
screenshotted because well I made it so

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,809
this is the kind of self plug and it is

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,700
also allows you to have multiple

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,980
different speed shop folders so that's

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,259
useful for our repose that are following

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,899
those and now it works is you run this

00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:14,029
and look man and it's like Saigon match

00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:18,739
screenshot which is going to act pretty

00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:24,679
much the same as a match snapshot that

00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:27,019
we have inside objects and what you can

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,239
do is very simply go to go visit that

00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:30,889
URL and go find whatever element you

00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,809
want and take a screenshot of that so

00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:38,809
it's very again human readable which is

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:40,570
nice finally we have a rather almost

00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,999
like we have other checks

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,340
this means lake house for web minutes

00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:49,909
that check for performance accessibility

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,809
best practices SEO and also size limit

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,850
for websites making sure that when we

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,279
are upgrading libraries or making

00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:03,399
changes we're not going to be going over

00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:06,320
our science budget if you haven't Alan

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:09,140
this is really going to cover a lot of

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,470
what we want with box as well as

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:18,890
sure that we are conformed conforming to

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:21,950
the standards of the web really and now

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,950
actual finally we have cross-browser and

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,560
cross-device testing I do have to say a

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,990
warning that I say whenever someone goes

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,600
into cross Felder's cross device testing

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,570
plus our code isn't written by us

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,450
anymore react is test this cross browser

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,460
and it will handle events for you so

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,940
that to make sure that any of us that

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,500
you use our we also have a lot of

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,620
polyfills everywhere don't make sure

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,090
that code is compatible cross browser

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,830
there's a lot of static tooling that you

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,260
can use to ensure that you're not using

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,320
API start missing polyfills such as the

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,690
Atlantic planning compact and if you

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:07,610
really are in a position where you need

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:10,430
or want to use sorry use cross browser

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:14,450
and device testing then you should still

00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:17,240
make it only a small part of your your

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,560
testing pipeline because that typically

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,570
would mean that you need to use browser

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:27,860
stack so that were very selenium and

00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:29,780
that is extremely flaky and has a lot of

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,550
weeks and it's very difficult to do

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,430
tester and develop so shouldn't really

00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,790
not be the bulk of occasion or a matter

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,470
you're suspect that being said our

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:43,790
applications are typically large enough

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:47,420
and have enough users that we want or

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:51,140
need it for a few of our any spaces so

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,370
we do have it as a smoke test dad is not

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,780
ranking that means I it has been

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,530
deployed and is running on a deployed

00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:00,320
version and it notifies us if it has but

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,020
it is not something that would stop it

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:08,169
from deploying history

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:10,840
false positives that is about it so

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:12,610
there's a lot more to this topic each

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,830
section of this would probably need some

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,419
talk but left a time that we have and

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,399
this is kind of to give you an overview

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,630
and hopefully give you an idea of what

00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,760
you should be looking out for when

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,659
building and testing Atlantis was any of

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,390
the text you could apply for them thank

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:31,809
you all and I think that's time for

00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,120
temper questions if you ever want to

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:37,200
Bluff deeper into this feel free to

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,200
