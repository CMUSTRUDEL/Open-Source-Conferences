hi everyone welcome to the first day of

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,210
open J's world I'm so excited to have

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,519
the chance to meet all of you virtually

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,170
over the next few days and I'm very

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,240
excited to be one of the folks kicking

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,460
us off on Tuesday morning so thank you

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,199
all for your time and for virtually

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,029
allowing me and the other speakers into

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,769
your homes

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:25,109
so my name is Keeley Hammond I'm a

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,000
senior software engineer at envision and

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,400
a member of the electron core governance

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,130
team I'm gonna be speaking today on

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,960
behalf of electron we joined the open

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,030
J's foundation last year as an

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,770
incubation project and what I'm going to

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,020
talk about today is the growth that

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,000
we've made as part of joining open Jas

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,649
and how we're hoping to become more

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,260
involved with the larger JavaScript

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,360
community but before I dive in I just

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,510
want to stop and say thank you to the

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,489
entire electron team so these are photos

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,219
from our maintainer summits over the

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,109
past three or four years and they

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,449
represent not only the electron core

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,489
team which is a fairly small team but

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,170
also the wide network of contributors

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,479
and maintainer x' from companies all

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,189
over the world so I want to thank that

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,200
larger maintainer Network but I also

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,720
want to give a special shout out to the

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,520
electron core team they've done a

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,830
tremendous amount of work over the past

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,880
year and I'm very excited and honored to

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,710
be representing them today so some of

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,750
you may be familiar with electron

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,060
already and some of you may even develop

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,729
an electron already but for those of you

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,229
who aren't familiar with who we are

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:33,299
electron is a JavaScript framework for

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,509
creating desktop applications with web

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,030
technologies and to dive a little bit

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,979
deeper into what that means electron is

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,380
ultimately a combination of three major

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,210
sub dependencies the first is chromium

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,630
which gives us everything we need to

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,000
render HTML Javascript and CSS the

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,070
second is node and nodes VA runtime

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,509
which I suspect many of you in the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,630
audience are quite familiar with and

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,820
then we have a layer of C++ and

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,950
objective-c and that layer implements

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,380
the API is that you as a developer need

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,540
to build a native application so for

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,250
example if you want your electron app to

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,660
interact with the native window object

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,520
or if you wanted to send native

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,930
notifications

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,260
together these three dependencies form

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,950
the

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,689
datian of electron you may already be

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,269
using electron to your day-to-day life

00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:24,150
for example if you're using slack to

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:27,870
collaborate with your colleagues or if

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,640
you're using the s code as your IDE my

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,769
own team at envision is building an app

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,510
called envision studio which is built on

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:38,730
electron and there are a lot of reasons

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,500
for a developer to choose electron for

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,299
their project but some of the primary

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,819
ones that we hear are cross-platform

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,069
support so instead of having to support

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,079
multiple native teams you can just write

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,239
one electron app that works on Mac

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,879
Windows and Linux out of the box you

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,010
have access to both web and native api's

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,560
and you also have access to the larger

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,450
JavaScript ecosystem which will help you

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
with things like supporting an auto

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,280
update server or packaging and

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,769
distributing your app finally we've been

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,260
experiencing rapid growth in the project

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,480
itself as more and more developers are

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,099
choosing to use electron we own the

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,090
electron team are trying to respond to

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:20,940
that growth and as part of that in 2019

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,260
we joined the open Jas foundation as an

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,230
incubation project and since then we've

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,660
done quite a lot to improve the

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,060
developer experience both as someone who

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,099
is writing an electron app and as

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,609
somebody who wants to contribute back to

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,590
the electron project some of the major

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,049
changes that came as part of our open

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,449
Jas incubation period we're a formal

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,400
governance structure so in March of 2019

00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:49,109
we established a governance structure

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,449
that covers several key areas you can

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,220
see here as well as an administrative

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,909
working group that oversees the project

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,190
as a whole we've also made a large

00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,569
investment into automation as many of

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,849
you who work in open source can probably

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,699
sympathize with people are our most

00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:07,349
constrained resource and so whenever we

00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,180
can free up and developer by having a

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,449
computer do the work instead we try to

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,530
do that we've made investments

00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,090
specifically into automating our nightly

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,739
and beta builds and improving our

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,229
distributed build system so that

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,450
developers have a much easier time

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,639
developing quickly we've also built out

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,090
our CI CD pipeline to include more

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,040
coverage for Mac Windows and Linux

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,880
and I finally want to give a shout-out

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,770
to core member shelleyf or so electron

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,260
now supports multiple major release

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,810
lines and Shelley wrote to bots that

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,930
help with maintaining that the first is

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,970
trop which automates back porting PRS to

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,940
various versions so for example if I'd

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,590
submitted a PR for electron 10 trot pool

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,620
automatically back poured that 2

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,110
electron 9 and so on and the second pot

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,030
is unreleased which audits branches that

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,040
are targeted for specific release lines

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,960
and it checks specifically for branches

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,270
that either haven't been merged yet or

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,220
need to be manually back ported both

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,190
trap and unreleased have saved us a lot

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,600
of time and if you are an open-source

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,790
maintainer that's running multiple

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,919
release lines I highly recommend talking

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,539
to Shelley she is an expert in this area

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,270
we've also made a lot of improvements to

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,190
electrons core api's this is by no means

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,860
a comprehensive list but some of the

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,840
highlights include the introduction of a

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,460
new module called context bridge and

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,770
this is something that we're hoping to

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,300
use as we depreciate our remote module

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,539
to give developers a safer way to

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,539
communicate across contexts we also made

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,150
improvements to how we send complex

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:43,460
JavaScript objects across IPC we're now

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,280
using v8 structured clone algorithm and

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,830
we've been actively modernizing our ap

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,020
is a big example of that is converting

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,280
our internal api's to return promises

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,470
rather than using callbacks but I would

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,539
say arguably the largest change that we

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,990
made in the incubation period happened

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,940
in May of 2019 so we changed our release

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,570
cadence to match more closely with

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,940
chromium's

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,550
chromium releases once every six weeks

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,460
an electron now releases a new major

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,440
version roughly every 12 weeks and the

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,960
result of that is that consumers that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,880
are building electron apps now have

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,760
access to newer versions of chromium

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:28,400
faster so as we were making these

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,169
changes we were also continuously moving

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,930
through the open Jas foundations

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:35,180
incubation program and I'm very excited

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,430
to announce today that electron has

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,409
graduated from the incubation program

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,509
and is now an open Jas in

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,119
Packt project and we're very excited

00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,219
about this for a lot of reasons but

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:48,080
chief among them is we wanted to take a

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:50,809
bigger part in the larger JavaScript

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,759
community the JavaScript ecosystem is so

00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,409
interconnected many of our own

00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,869
maintained errs contribute to other

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,639
projects such as node and as electron

00:06:56,869 --> 00:07:00,589
continue to grow we want it to be

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,139
intentional about giving back to that

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,179
rich ecosystem and also inviting some of

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,779
you all into the electron community if

00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:10,429
you'd like to join us so in that spirit

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,110
if you're interested in getting more

00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,819
involved in electron or learning a bit

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,129
more about the project we would love to

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,379
have you we've made a concentrated

00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,389
effort in the last year or so to make it

00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,039
easier for new contributors to jump in

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,259
and start contributing PRS to the

00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,999
project we've done this through a series

00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,759
of contributor training events such as

00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:31,639
this one we held in January of 2020 and

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,829
we've also improved electrons build

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,110
tools creating an easy set of scripts

00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,969
for new contributors to use to clone

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,800
down electron locally and start

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,749
developing and I want to give a special

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,419
shout out here to four members of the

00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,449
core team shell Eve or Sam a turd

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,279
charles kerr and john Kleinschmidt the

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,229
four of them recognize this as a

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,169
considerable hurdle for new contributors

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:58,249
last fall and work together to put these

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,169
build tools together and if you'd like

00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,819
to learn more about electron but you

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,339
don't quite feel like jumping into the

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,289
core project yet electron fiddle is a

00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,689
great way to start exploring what you

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,579
can do an electron this is an easy

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,279
