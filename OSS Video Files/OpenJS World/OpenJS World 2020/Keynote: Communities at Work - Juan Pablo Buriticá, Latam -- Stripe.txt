hi I am Juan Pablo Latika I'm from

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,269
Bogota Colombia and I live in New York

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,429
City when I first accepted to get this

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,090
talk I was the VP of engineering at a

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,160
music company called splice there I led

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,900
a distributed engineering team focused

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,230
on building tools and services that help

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,359
musicians make more and better music a

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,910
month ago I joined stripe as the head of

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,769
engineering for Latin America now I'll

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,090
get the chance to help build financial

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,610
infrastructure for startups and

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,489
developers in the region with the team

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,260
I'll get to build this next talk is

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,690
about something I hold very close to my

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,730
heart I've been building communities and

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,730
teams for quite some time

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,900
a long time ago I had a boss who said

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,940
our company was like a family at the

00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,670
time I didn't really get why that

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,360
statement rubbed me the wrong way but it

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,420
did today after having led a few teams I

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,130
understand why I felt that way though

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,110
families aren't famous for being the

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,560
most functional organizational structure

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,960
I could have begged my mom to put my

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,030
brother on a pip because he kept leaving

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
his dirty clothes on the floor of the

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,759
bedroom we shared but my mom would have

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,700
never gone along with it believe me I

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,280
tried so when we're dealing with family

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,810
members we lower our boundaries and

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:37,490
tolerate things we wouldn't usually

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:39,170
because we are family I'm not the first

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,149
person to notice that families are not a

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,000
great example to mirror when you're

00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:45,590
building engineering teams Netflix is

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,100
famous for calling it out in their

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,720
culture deck I don't think my boss was

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,780
ill intended when they thought of our

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,119
team as a family but I've learned to

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,060
recognize it as a flag in the culture of

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,950
organizations or teams I encounter it

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,950
usually leads me to ask more questions

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,649
another common analogy used to talk

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,270
about teams as sports sports teams give

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,330
us excellent examples of what

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,319
collaboration could look like

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,590
high-performing sports teams achieve

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,930
incredible feat when they work together

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,000
so when I was trying to think of ways to

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,420
shape my principles around building

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,209
teams

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,300
I thought about sports there's some

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:33,470
excellent metaphors about teamwork

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:36,380
but the biggest problem I had was I was

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,700
terrible at team sports it's not because

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,180
there was a poor team player

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,450
I was just horrible at playing most team

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,610
sports not all of them just does you

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,580
play with other people that's why I

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,590
loved skateboarding the only one I'd be

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,580
letting down would be myself if I

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,290
couldn't kickflip imagine growing up in

00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,870
Colombia and not being good at playing

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,000
football

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,739
I'm not joking when I say my friends

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,769
would fight over who wouldn't have me on

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,489
their team but don't be sad it was

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,950
actually good

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,459
it meant I spent some of my research

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,610
time at the library working around IT to

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,890
try to get SimCity installed so now I

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,230
get to keynote next to someone who has

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,849
been to space just like the big nerd I

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,920
am but so sports weren't something I

00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:31,480
could base my leadership principles on

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:36,329
and families aren't right either what

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:39,250
then outside of computers in science

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:42,400
music has had an enormous influence on

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,500
my life now if you ask my partner

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,180
Melanie she tell you that those screams

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,459
are listening to shouldn't be qualified

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,620
as music and in some cases she'd be

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,220
right but there's something beyond those

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,430
screams I played my first show when I

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,680
was 13 somewhere in the middle of bogota

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,989
colombia i stood on a stage and i

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,290
screamed at the top of my lungs right

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,420
next to four of my best friends I looked

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,639
at the mosh pit and I felt like I

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,489
belonged the hardcore punk community

00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,859
gave me something I didn't have before

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,389
it was a place where people from very

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,090
different backgrounds and shared values

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,229
came together towards a common goal

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,690
some people work towards animal

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:25,150
liberation others towards increasing

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,510
social and political awareness or even

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,860
fundraising for benefit causes DIY as a

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:36,460
subculture comes from Punk this is word

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,410
tutorial jeans comfort I am Who I am

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,639
today

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,389
thanks to the communities that I've had

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,330
access to

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,700
I learned JavaScript thanks to all the

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,060
jQuery contributors who took the time to

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,760
write tutorials under virtual scenes or

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,950
blog posts without being conscious about

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,490
it I started building teams around

00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:01,090
principles that were very natural to me

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,740
community principles I used everything I

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,450
learned from putting shows together in

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,060
Bogota to start a few community

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,159
conferences in Colombia at the same time

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,659
I was granted the opportunity to build

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,439
high-performing software teams for

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,809
startups

00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,249
I'd like to share with you some of the

00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:17,110
community qualities I've tried to

00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:19,569
replicate in the organizations I lead

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:23,830
maybe these can help you build healthy

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:25,349
organizations of your own the first of

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,019
these community qualities is

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,639
collectivity many of the challenges the

00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,309
team faces can only be solved

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,019
collectively we're not talking

00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:36,429
specifically about the business problem

00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,889
that the team is supposed to be

00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:41,439
addressing but rather obstacles that the

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,559
organization faces from Whalen for

00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,259
example I prefer to lead and belong to

00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:49,779
teams that aren't homogeneous lack of

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,599
diversity is a collective challenge as a

00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:54,969
leader I am responsible for shaping the

00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,669
organization but it isn't something I

00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,889
can do alone this doesn't mean that I

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,379
asked the only woman on my team to

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,659
convince other to join us on the

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,610
contrary it means that everyone in the

00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:09,309
group understands a problem and actively

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,399
works to change it so when we are

00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:15,819
solving collective challenges we come

00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:20,849
together as a community to work towards

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:23,979
them the next quality I value is

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:26,319
education the communities I admire

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:28,779
invests heavily in the education of all

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,959
of their members this is how they grow

00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:34,469
together this is where as I mentioned

00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:37,419
before the DIY movement comes from

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,879
learning how to tackle technical tasks

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,269
and sharing expertise gifts tools to

00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,639
everyone hardcore Punk's or punks in

00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:48,969
general one in other people to learn how

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:54,339
to print t-shirts how to organize shows

00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:56,829
how to record how to share cassettes DIY

00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:02,319
scenes were the beginning of tutorials

00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:04,329
as a manager I have to create the space

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,599
and provide the resources for community

00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,159
education to happen in my company

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,769
whereas open-source communities rely on

00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:14,829
volunteers and so can music communities

00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:17,679
my business shouldn't it's a business in

00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:20,349
the end and everything we do is for the

00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:23,079
sake of the business so by combining the

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:25,000
community spirit of education with the

00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,400
business resources

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,310
provide support in foster community

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,310
education which leads to a better team

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,960
communities also characterize themselves

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,060
by their shared culture they create an

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,790
identity and they shape it from their

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,890
values communities at work can bridge

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:49,060
cultural gaps by creating a culture of

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,980
their own emojis memes in anecdotes are

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:55,030
all artifacts that connect members to

00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,100
their community for example you can

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,460
Audrey that when you use the tomato

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,100
emoji it means that some behavior needs

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,590
to be talked about you need feedback it

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,110
wasn't cool someone didn't take it the

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,150
way you thought and then that little

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,770
emoji takes meaning and it can help

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,520
everyone communicate around something

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,410
that may have been uncomfortable before

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,419
if you show this to any of the engineers

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,240
that I hired it splice they'll know

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,040
exactly what it means

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,130
it's an artifact that we created from a

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,650
phrase we coined in art first on site we

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,090
met in New Orleans and we agreed that we

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,320
wanted a team that was supportive of

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:38,080
everyone the base not the bassist is a

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,169
supportive instrument it carries the

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,110
rhythm and it has no ego it helps

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:49,000
everyone else shine it's what we wanted

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,200
our team to be I've come to value

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,360
communities that care about me

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,110
especially when I am someone who tends

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,050
to be different I am an immigrant I

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,780
don't play sports I don't like the music

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,390
everyone else does the JavaScript

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,160
community is a great example the

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,230
barodius communities in New York City

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,820
provide me with a place where I can

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,370
learn about a beautifully terrible

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,250
language that I love it has also become

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,520
my backbone as an immigrant I haven't

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,839
just been accepted I've been embraced

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,640
many of my friends have come to learn

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,480
and support the place where I come from

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,210
I love to provide those experience of

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,639
support to everyone I work with the

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:35,290
longing helps us work better

00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,660
another quality I value from communities

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,630
and try to replicate at work is the

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,550
concept of community leadership the

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,889
authority of being an engineering leader

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,980
or a manager doesn't confirm the

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,690
engineering knowledge on the contrary it

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,899
removes me from the context of building

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,970
software the only way I can get a deep

00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,279
understanding of the challenges that my

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,279
team members face is by building

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,709
trusting relationships with them this

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,740
helps you learn and also make better

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,180
decisions on our behalf

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,910
I've also learned I'm not the only

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,730
leader the authority over the technical

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,720
domain belongs to everyone who writes

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:19,029
code every line of code is a decision

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,209
that they are making on behalf of our

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:28,029
collective in the end creative workers

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,279
are problem solvers and have come to

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,070
appreciate Punk's who don't take my

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,019
authority for granted I like to think

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,930
that even though I am frequently wrong

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,420
we are collectively right and my team

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,440
members will help me see it

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,760
this way of leadership can be

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,949
challenging for people who favor

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,600
traditional management structures so I

00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,949
don't recommend everyone goes out and

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,240
hires a bunch of punks

00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:51,579
who consistently questioned the

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,940
authority but it's worked very well for

00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:57,339
me I like being questioned and pushed on

00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,430
every decision I make for the business

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,610
or for our team because I may have blind

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,810
spots that my team helps me realize

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,910
identify and usually fix an additional

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,310
quality I appreciate of communities that

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,930
value learning is how much effort they

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,990
put towards making it safe to make

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,050
mistakes if you've ever sat through the

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,990
intro of Brooklyn Jas which is almost 30

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,990
minutes you've witnessed firsthand how

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:30,190
much the organizers emphasize on being a

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,319
welcoming environment we feel safe we

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,440
can focus on solving problems other than

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:37,060
those that affect our safety here's

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,149
where I show you the Maslow's hierarchy

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:43,300
of needs diagram you laugh because it's

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,400
s Wi-Fi and then I highlight that after

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,860
basic physiological needs

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,960
safety is the most important thing in

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,170
the pursuit of self-actualization and

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,510
learning when we're building software

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,120
products we embark in a process of

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,850
continual learning in this requires that

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,110
we make many mistakes shout out if

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,300
you've ever dropped the production

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,400
database before I know I have but if our

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,730
workplace mirrors a community the value

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,950
safety then it can foster a learning

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,450
environment or asking questions or

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,590
making mistakes in the pursuit of

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:23,200
learning isn't chastised communities

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,730
that value safety are also very quick to

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,950
correct behaviors when new members

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,570
threatened the safety they build the

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,280
language to give feedback when new

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,830
individuals come from places were

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,980
pretending to be constantly right is the

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,660
norm you can think of these reactions as

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,730
the immune system for our team

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,250
since our community cares for its

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,020
members it also develops non-threatening

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,110
ways of giving feedback that could

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,570
otherwise lead to conflict for example I

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,220
gave my teammate splice an emoji of my

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,080
head that they could use to a never lay

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,440
felt like I was getting you know their

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,140
business

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,150
I should be trusting them instead and

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,650
they could use the emoji reaction to

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,180
tell me this finally the way healthy

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,840
communities foster and value less

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,490
glamorous work is something I admire

00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,470
members take on tasks because it's the

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,430
right thing to do for the group they

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,820
have to get done

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:18,580
for example door duty at a hard core

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,550
strong you'll inevitably miss a band or

00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,520
two maybe even your favorite but you

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,230
know it is necessary in return the

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,150
community may compensate you by giving

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:33,040
you a free ticket at work managers

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,020
aren't always in a position to take on

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,510
all of the administrative tasks needed

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,390
for the operation of a team so community

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,200
support can lend a hand if you go down

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,270
this path

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,550
I recommend that managers ensure that

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,880
there's an equitable distribution of any

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:53,000
administrative work randomizing may be a

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,709
better idea than asking for volunteers

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,720
I've been fortunate to have the chance

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,870
to build organizations filled with

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,550
wonderful humans I like to think that

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,500
the community environment we've built at

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,480
work is one of the main reasons why

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,450
these talented engineers chose us in

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,149
today's competitive environment but you

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,730
have to ask them the one thing I can

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,630
tell you the supportive culture beats

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,370
startup perks

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:22,110
every time I believe everyone deserves

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,020
an opportunity of doing their best work

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,089
in a supportive environment and I hope

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,760
that what I've heard today helps you

00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,610
shape the team's you built or join in to

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,190
supportive communities at work if you'd

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,990
like to learn more about my work or have

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,230
any questions you can follow me on

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,120
Twitter thank you for having me and

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,230
thank you open Jas
