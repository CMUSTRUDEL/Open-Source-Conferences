our journey towards a sustainable

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,910
solution to open source sustainability

00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:17,630
starts a few years back in April 2014

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:23,970
exactly who here recognizes this logo

00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:31,040
any takers yeah it is the logo of the

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:34,230
heartbleed bug a bug so bad that it

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,149
compromised the confidentiality of four

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:42,059
and a half million u.s. patient records

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:50,250
and cost the industry an estimated 500

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:52,640
million dollars that bug was a pivotal

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,000
moment where the tech industry realized

00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:02,539
that open source was ubiquitous critical

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,549
and highly underfunded ubiquitous

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:09,960
because the open SSL library that had

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,630
this bug was actually relied upon by

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,509
two-thirds of active web sites on the

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,840
Internet critical because the open SSL

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,150
library was responsible for encryption

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,560
keeping communication private making

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,159
bank transaction jacksons secure

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:37,680
securing medical records etc and

00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:40,740
underfunded because open SSL only had

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,820
one full-time maintainer and was

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:51,680
operating on a ridiculously small budget

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,680
of roughly $2,000 per year

00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,479
of course this created like a sis

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,790
mashach in the industry and everyone

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,969
started talking about the problem of

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,410
open source sustainability of maintainer

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:13,170
burnout and people starting started to

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,709
try to find solutions the

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,880
solutions that emerged were very much

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:25,230
focused on preventing another heartbleed

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,690
bug the first one was the core

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,650
infrastructure initiative there was an

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,739
industry-wide

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,020
effort backed by the large tech

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,760
companies and organized by the Linux

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,989
Foundation it had a pretty large fund

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,459
that was administered by the Linux

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,830
Foundation itself and a steering

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,709
committee of composed of industry

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,290
experts and its goal was really to

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,230
harden the security of key open source

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,069
projects but because its focus was

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,730
essentially on core infrastructure ie to

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,160
prevent a new heartbleed it really was

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,739
not looking at making open source as a

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:12,980
whole more sustainable as a result a lot

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:17,370
of other efforts started existing a

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,670
really interesting one was open source

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:25,769
developers deciding to leverage existing

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,720
tools such as patreon so patreon is

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:32,700
originally aimed at artists musicians

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,670
and writers you know it's its goal is to

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:40,200
create a meaningful revenue stream for

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:45,230
artists and it had in the person of a

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:51,060
value pictured here a real success story

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:53,970
Evan was able to quite quickly collect

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,810
roughly seventeen thousand dollars per

00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:05,390
month in order to fund him working

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:09,170
full-time on the VJs project however

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:13,200
there there aren't that many other

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:16,079
similar examples of a single open source

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,410
developer being able to essentially get

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,760
the equivalent of a reasonable full-time

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:26,250
tech salary to focus fully on open

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:32,750
source outside of working for

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:35,940
company let's look at another different

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,590
attempt to create a similar kind of

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,510
revenue stream for print source

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,700
developers get coin so what exactly is

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:49,860
good coin won't get coin is actually

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:52,440
multiple things but sensual to it is a

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,020
github issue market where as a developer

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,290
was the owner of a project you can

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,250
essentially add bounties to github

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,140
issues and developers submit their work

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,740
as a pull request and claim the bounty

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,230
as such and the platform actually has

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,840
been distributing quite a bunch of money

00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:16,500
over half a million dollar in 2018 only

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,919
right its blockchain based so developer

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,020
has actually received bounties and ether

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,540
but what's quite interesting about good

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,480
point is it's a whole ecosystem so it

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,740
also provides a patreon like solution

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:36,150
called grants and a small ad network

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,360
code fund what is coach fund while code

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,870
fund leverages the fact that open-source

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,490
projects usually have websites and that

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:52,740
those websites are great places to find

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,650
developers interested in a specific set

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,290
of technology right so the ads are very

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,180
much focused on hiring and the

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,479
contextual hands so you know they avoid

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,070
all of the tracking issues that

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:10,680
advertisement usually has on the web

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:14,040
from a financial perspective code

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,400
funding has been roughly creating ten

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,610
thousand dollars of monthly revenue of

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,160
which 60% so six six thousand dollars

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:28,260
per month is redistributed to project

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:31,220
maintainer x' open source sustainability

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,180
has even attracted venture capitalists

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,030
which was OSS capital have created a

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,630
venture fund specializing in open source

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,720
base

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,440
companies another really interesting

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,180
project is open collective so open

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,410
collective initially was designed for

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,960
essentially communities to self-organize

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,780
and it has been applied quite

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,820
effectively to open source so open

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,950
collective even created an open um of

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,020
501 C 6 so a nonprofit to collect funds

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,020
for open source and provide the

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,290
transparency and then redistribute that

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,540
money to the maintainer of open source

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,330
projects as they saw fit

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,360
so the real big success story of open

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:25,890
collective is of course webpack which

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:30,360
has been funded in four to five hundred

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:35,130
thousand dollars per year and created

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,380
like a really really win-win situation

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,560
for key sponsors there's a really

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:44,090
interesting story about how trivago

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:48,150
funded webpack threw up and collective

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,880
and essentially as a result got a ton of

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,010
interest from javascript developers who

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:59,490
wanted to join a company because they

00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:03,450
saw it as really caring about open

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:06,660
source that said open collective has

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,550
somewhat of a long tail problem because

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,620
essentially most of the money is going

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,400
to a few projects that have a lot of

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,130
visibility and the rest of the projects

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,220
on getting as much money and so in order

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:23,880
to solve that open collective created

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,670
back your stack the idea reeling back

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,860
your stack is that as the owner of a

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:31,020
project or was a company that relies on

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,660
a bunch of open source projects or has a

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,870
bunch of projects on their github you

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,110
can basically just run a code and it

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,910
will tell you not only your dependencies

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,360
but the dependencies of your

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:48,390
dependencies recursively and then allow

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,800
you to essentially fund the whole

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:56,519
dependency tree through open collective

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,059
this is actually a very similar scheme

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:04,350
to what tide lifts another company

00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:07,470
operating in this space has created as a

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,129
business model so what is tide lifts

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,350
exactly well it's essentially um red

00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:17,819
hats business model but for the long

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:20,910
tail so it provides two companies in a

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,860
number of things around and open-source

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,850
projects including security updates

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,209
maintenance legal insurance etc for all

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,660
of the open source projects that an

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:35,730
organization relies on and how does it

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,379
does it how does it do it sorry well

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,410
that's the really interesting aspect is

00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:42,420
it do it by paying the actual maintainer

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:46,679
of the projects to do the work to keep

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,049
those projects up to date and secure and

00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,029
so contrary to the other projects that

00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,540
we've talked about there's no real

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:57,269
success story yet of a set of developers

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,759
having build a business on top of tight

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:07,110
left but they're certainly like a lot of

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:11,129
interest for it so you know we've looked

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:14,309
at a few solutions around open source

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:20,009
sustainability but I think it's also

00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:23,100
time to consider taking a different look

00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:27,529
at those and seeing whether they really

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:33,179
'trust a problem in a way that seems

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:35,610
like a good fit and frankly there are a

00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,089
number of limitations of addressing open

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:42,629
source sustainability through just the

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,089
lense of funding right the first problem

00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:47,610
is whether or not it actually skills

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,369
like is the current level of funding

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,949
that we're providing realistic compared

00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:54,919
to the ubiquity of open source to the

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,860
fact that open source is everywhere

00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:01,589
secondly we can really wonder whether

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,399
money is really the problem and what's

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,600
missing from over the source wait so

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,319
essentially only asking them

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,680
problem was this thirdly and I think

00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:19,310
that's also really key as it's important

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:23,360
to wonder whether solving open-source

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:25,920
sustainability through funding alone

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,949
would create the kind of outcomes that

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,680
we want to see in the industry don't we

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:35,250
don't we risk a future where we'd have

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,860
on one side charity funded open-source

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,769
developers and on the other sort of

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,819
corporate developers writing essentially

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:47,490
glue code and so you know being fairly

00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:50,970
well paid but having really really

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,800
boring jobs and lastly I think and

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,209
that's sort of where I believe is the

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,079
real answer to open-source

00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:00,870
sustainability long-term is to have a

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,490
different look at what the real value of

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,360
open-source is you know and to try to

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,000
address this issue

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:15,060
what's that perspective in mind all

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:23,040
right so let's look at scaling first so

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:27,259
this is $100 bill if you stack $100

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,430
sorry a hundred bills of $100 you get

00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:34,139
$10,000 in this nice little stack here

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,560
for reference that is the monthly

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,259
revenue that code fund that we've just

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,939
talked about is making from

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:48,779
advertisement now if we stack a hundred

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:54,180
of those right so two orders of

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:56,490
magnitude more we get to $1,000,000 so

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,899
this is roughly the amount of money that

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,480
opened collective is collecting um

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,370
higher or at least was in 2018 and 2019

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,750
I don't know what the numbers are for

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:12,810
2019 sorry but roughly around that

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,279
that's also the amount that tide lifts

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,490
the other company that we talked about

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,160
earlier has committed to pay developers

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:28,519
from all the VC funding

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:31,920
they received but how much is really

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,800
$1,000,000 comparing to sort of like the

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,079
size of open-source in the world and and

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,540
a good example of that a good way of

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,360
thinking about that to me is to sort of

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,379
have a look at the worldwide developer

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,560
population and see how many developers

00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:53,459
there are actually as a story and

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,009
secondly um to start thinking about how

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,709
much money are these developers paid

00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:02,189
like what's them was total mass of

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:04,410
salary paid to developers worldwide so

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,899
this is data from developer census that

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,540
was won in 2018 and it basically says

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,899
that there are roughly 12 million

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,670
full-time professional developers a

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:17,750
little over 6 million that are working

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,149
part-time and roughly 4 million that are

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,790
non-professional right so a bit above 20

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,310
million developers one way let's do some

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,740
some quick back of the envelope math to

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:34,139
see what kind of like salary the total

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:38,790
salary that creates worldwide so if we

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:42,079
take a 65 South thousand annual salary

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,439
for developers for full-time developers

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:50,220
this gives us roughly seven hundred and

00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:53,600
eighty billion dollars spent worldwide

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,790
on full-time developers and to that

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,370
roughly thirty five K for the six

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:03,449
million part-time developers per year

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,699
and you get another two hundred and ten

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,899
billion dollars if you add this up it

00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:13,860
gives you roughly one trillion dollars

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:16,680
spent in wages per year on software

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,750
developers so that doesn't account for

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,259
everything else right from the computer

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:26,360
to the rooms in which they work to taxes

00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:29,490
paid on on the salaries etc etc right

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,709
just salary you know you know those

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,470
numbers might be high for some parts of

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,140
the world

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,640
they're also you know 65 and 35k but

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,450
they're also quite low for other parts

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,330
of the world mate

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,820
um so it a trillion dollar gives us a

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,310
good sort of like you know guesstimate

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,830
of roughly how much money is spent

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,650
so now let's sort of like compare it

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:56,920
back to the 1 million dollars that we're

00:15:50,650 --> 00:16:01,560
spending on funding open source so if

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:07,960
you take a hundred of those sort of like

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:09,790
a stack of $100 bills you get a pallet

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,040
like you wouldn't palette and and you

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,940
stack it all those and that gives you a

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:20,530
hundred million dollars right now get 10

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:24,190
of those and you have 1 billion dollars

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,640
right 10 pallets four hundred dollar

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,230
bills 1 billion dollars but remember the

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,830
wages were talking about there's not 1

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,590
billion

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:37,330
it's a trillion dollars so let's have a

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:41,230
look at what that means right here you

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,600
have 10 billion dollars right so you

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,740
have for size of a phone a full-size

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,630
truck on the left let's have a look at

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,410
what one trillion dollar means you need

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:57,190
to stack a hundred of those to find a

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,260
one trillion dollar right so one

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,460
trillion dollar is that skyscraper right

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,830
there are made of hundred dollar bills

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,290
on wooden pallets on stack wooden

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:10,090
pallets for science remember down there

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,710
we have a $1,000,000 right so what can

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:14,110
we say about this well that there's a

00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,670
huge discrepancy between some of the

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,750
money that is spent on developers

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:27,700
worldwide right and the money that is

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:31,720
used to fund open source right now and

00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:34,390
so that begs the question is money

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,130
really what's missing right are we

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,770
trying to solve the right problem here

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,950
and so what an interesting way of

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,640
looking at this is looking at the amount

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,800
of developers that are actually

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,080
fully employed by a company and they

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,540
were not looking for actual funding

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,040
right so the open you know them the

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,810
Linux kernel is an interesting example

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,900
because we have data for this from the

00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,570
next kernel development report so in

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,190
2016 right at ears have done heartbleed

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,230
bug but that was that has been

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:11,310
consistent before and was consistent um

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:13,840
after roughly 93 percent 92% sorry of

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,910
developers working on the Linux kernel

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,190
we're employed then we're doing data

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,120
support of their job so it's it's not

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,710
like it's suddenly you know they will

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,770
certainly spend more time because

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,300
they're paying for it then they you know

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,250
they get funded for it right

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,900
it's Smallville Washington may me do

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,900
they have enough time to work on this

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:45,160
and you know before we sort of like dive

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:48,250
deeper into if it's not money then what

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,320
is it I think it's it's worth spending a

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,340
bit more time considering what would the

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,470
the outcome be um if we really found a

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:04,230
way to fund open-source developers on

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:04,230
one side and really for me a really key

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:13,600
quote and in that space is one by DHH

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:17,860
the creator of Ruby on Rails who wrote

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,410
in 2013 in an article called the perils

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,420
of mixing open source and money the

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:29,290
following thing he said this part of the

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,530
reason much of open source is so good

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:35,680
and often so superior to closed source

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:39,100
commercial projects is the natural

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,410
boundary of constraints if you're not

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,020
being paid or otherwise compensated

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,750
directly for your work you're less

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,700
likely to needlessly embellish it you're

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,970
solving the problems for you in your

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,700
mates likely in the simplest way you

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,940
could so you can get back to whatever

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,120
you originally intended to do before

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,450
starting to shave

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,530
yeah so what is th age talking about

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:10,660
here he's essentially saying that there

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:15,290
are real benefits in having a culture of

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:19,420
developers working on projects one on

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:23,180
products on software and as part of that

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:27,140
taking a little bit of time to package

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,600
sort of like well scope solutions as

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,510
open source projects that they can open

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,960
source rather than build a whole

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,600
industry and a whole organization of

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,420
people doing the sort of open source as

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:45,620
a business so I think that's a really

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:48,920
interesting aspect is to say that the

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,800
frugality of having to build open source

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,890
projects like this makes the project's

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,960
really really focused on solving

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,250
specific problems and not so unlike

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,030
development for the sake of them enough

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:10,550
development again as I said before the

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:15,130
other real risk for me of really helping

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:17,690
to fund open source strictly through

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,750
essentially money charity like the

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:23,210
nation's is the real risk of Bill of

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,270
building this sort of like separate

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:29,960
culture we have on on one side open

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,179
source developers funded by large

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:37,309
corporations creating open source

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:41,720
software that is then you know and and

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:44,260
and these developers living not really

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,900
well like not really having ends meet

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,080
having to to go from funding to funding

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,420
having to fight to sort of like a hustle

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,160
to sort of get enough funds to continue

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,170
being able to work on a project right

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,470
with the risk all the risks that we've

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,000
seen before maintainer burnout etc

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,790
projects getting closed security issues

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,700
not being resolved the projects not

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,760
being patched etc and on the other hand

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,630
you know this is sort of like corporate

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,220
cast of

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:18,500
of developers was really nice salaries

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,960
but essentially writing gluco the mail

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,710
and open source software greeted me

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,310
elsewhere and that doesn't seem like a

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,010
really beneficial um great environment

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:35,090
to work in for actually neither of the

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:36,860
Pipers in this script and i think this

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,230
sort of brings us to a last question

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:43,280
which is what is the real value of open

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:47,150
source and isn't it time to sort of look

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:51,050
beyond the value of just the source code

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,610
and consider all of the other aspects of

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:56,900
open source and all of the other

00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:00,830
benefits of contributing to open source

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:05,450
that you can have outside of just the

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,880
source code itself so you know the way

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,340
that we've been sort of thinking about

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,980
this open source sustainability problem

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,540
is to think of open source as a pool of

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,010
Commons like all of the software

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,590
available to everyone

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,530
built by open source developers that you

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,010
sort of see around this point here you

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,780
know on the other hand like across the

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,810
border in the middle corporations

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:33,110
relying an open source software to build

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,640
stuff and so we've realized that there's

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,050
a real problem here because no one's

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,060
paying for these open source developers

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,550
and as a result the software has

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,400
problems and so we're just throwing

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:46,300
money at the problem right so funding

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,920
open source essentially through cash

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,400
with the hope that this will motivate

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,320
all of these different actors in this

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:59,120
mythical open source ecosystem to

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:02,960
contribute to the pool of Commons and as

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,570
a result that corporations funding this

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,940
open source projects in the and the

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,120
other ones just benefiting from those

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,750
funds well be able to sort of capture

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:20,660
the perceived value of this pool of

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:23,180
Commons this in my opinion really misses

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,590
the big picture of what the true value

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,820
of open source is

00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,639
and if you've been part of an

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,740
open-source ecosystem I mean and to some

00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:33,440
degree all of you being here today are

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,480
about a part of one right at different

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,090
levels obviously but you've realized

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,970
that a lot of the value and it opens

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,919
with ecosystem isn't just the code being

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:46,490
funded right

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:50,899
it's the code being worked on sorry it's

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:53,090
actually all of the interactions all of

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:55,610
the warnings all of the benefits of

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,119
being in a community that is working

00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:07,220
together on solving a really complex and

00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:09,470
difficult coding problems um so the real

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:14,480
value and I've talked about that then in

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:18,139
in other talks but the real value is the

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,879
the benefit in the learning that as an

00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:22,429
individual participating in this

00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:24,769
community you're getting right and so

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:29,149
the real value all of you are actually

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:31,850
taking back with you home but also to

00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:33,559
the company's debt unable with you to

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:39,169
work in this to participate in this

00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:46,249
ecosystem and so the real question then

00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:49,610
becomes um not sort of how you can

00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:51,830
capture the value as a corporation right

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:55,009
the capture the value of the code but

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,990
how you should really refocus your

00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:59,629
attention to sort of understand how you

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,090
can capture and how you can capture the

00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:05,539
value that is created by this whole set

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,119
of interactions and to better understand

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,450
that to better understand how companies

00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,519
should get involved in open source it's

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,950
good to stop looking at corporations as

00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,019
just these like entities but also

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,360
consider that these entities are full of

00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,249
developers that are themselves quite

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:28,580
capable of actually contributing to open

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:31,190
source and in lots of cases do and so

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,279
instead of really focusing on just these

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,649
developers coming to open source let's

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,360
remember that the real value of open

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:43,370
source is in

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:46,490
of these interactions right you know so

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,560
you know if you actually allow as a

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:52,510
company your developers to participate

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,030
in this ecosystem right all of those

00:26:52,510 --> 00:27:00,170
interactions are going to help your

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:05,510
developers influence the project learn

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:08,510
from others etc right you know that as a

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,120
result of these interactions as a result

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:13,190
of this community your developers

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,040
participating in that ecosystem will

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:18,410
actually bring all of the value that

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,370
they have acquired back home and that's

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:26,870
how corporations truly benefit from open

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:29,930
source not only not just by using the

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:33,470
code that's the output of this whole

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:35,630
process but really by getting their

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:40,220
engineers involved in a process and

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:43,460
leveling them up improving allowing

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:45,740
allowing them to grow and benefit from

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,200
this ecosystem and becoming better

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,760
engineers understanding and adopting

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,380
better practices etc you know you know

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,480
as a conclusion I think it's really

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,690
important to understand that charity

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,180
likes funding to open source alone is

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,220
not going to be the solution right of

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,850
course it's a great ad and it's

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,720
wonderful if we can allow a number of

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:13,550
community members to live open source

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,010
differently and more can open source

00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:18,860
full-time are not necessarily working

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,410
for cooperation if that's what they want

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,140
and if like the whole ecosystem benefits

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:28,190
as a result right but the real way

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,830
forward is to normalize engineers like

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:35,780
you all contributing to open source as

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:38,780
part of their day job and to make that

00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:41,240
possible the best solution is to make

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,990
corporations and organizations really

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,790
understand the return on investment of

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,970
having their teams contribute to open

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,970
source

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:56,010
voila that's it for today people I love

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:59,400
to have questions about this and I'm

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,600
happy to 'trust them in the chat thank

00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,130
you so much for your coming your

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,130
