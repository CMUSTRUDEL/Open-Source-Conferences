hey everybody I'm an eel - from glitch

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:11,370
and as some of you might know glitch is

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,660
a tool that lets anybody easily create a

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,790
full stack web app right in their

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,949
browser and hopefully have fun doing it

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,539
it's also a community where people code

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,010
together collaborate together share the

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,470
apps and the projects they've created

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,939
and it's really been something special

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,789
over the last couple years to watch it

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,019
grow but what I wanted to do is share

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,550
some of the lessons we've learned that

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,430
are applicable way beyond any one

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,930
product or any one company and

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,700
interestingly there are sort of two key

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,940
lessons that are particularly relevant

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,250
to the open Jas community one of the

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,800
first insights we had was what seems

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,129
like a small idea at first that we don't

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,510
code alone and you know we started it as

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,829
sort of a superficial level thinking

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,570
about the fact that you could edit code

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,449
together and that was where that idea

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,190
really started but the more we talked

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,920
about it the more we thought about it

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,989
the deeper that idea seek I'm gonna come

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,850
back to that one of the other early

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,890
choices we made was that while any

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,590
programming language or any toolkit can

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,110
work on glitch we were gonna focus we

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,119
were going to make a choice a decision

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,030
about what community we wanted to be

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,250
part of and choice we made was to

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,530
support JavaScript now obviously that's

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,210
not that radical a choice to make these

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,759
days but you go back a couple years ago

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,560
and it wasn't as obvious because the

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,570
truth is what we've seen this trajectory

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,799
of JavaScript over the last several

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,750
years is extraordinary these days the

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,579
majority of developers who work in the

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,500
world have JavaScript as part of their

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,640
toolkit now it might be for build

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,990
scripts it might be something that's

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,030
helping out as they use another

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,909
programming language but it's there

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,490
and that's radical because there's no

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,780
point in history before now where

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,659
there's been a programming language that

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,890
most developers use it's really

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,500
extraordinary and it's gone kind of

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,619
unremarked that this milestone happened

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,369
but it speaks to the power of what

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,610
javascript is and the truth is that's a

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,920
question worth asking what is JavaScript

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,690
because it's not just a language and

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
it's not even just a family of languages

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,090
I mean these days we see typescript is

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,640
so ascendant the tools are soaked

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,950
and I'm old-school enough I remember

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,290
back when we had jscript an actionscript

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,910
anybody still remember jscript I mean

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,980
there's been a family of languages and

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,640
tools for a long time so what's

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,050
different well a lot of times the reflex

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,489
when we talk about what's different is

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,739
to go to thinking about the language

00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,299
itself maybe it's the way it uses curly

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,560
brackets and semicolons maybe it's

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:37,930
something to do with you know

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,000
inheritance and and the truth is those

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,319
things matter those things matter as a

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,390
programming language becomes more

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,370
popular but a lot of those things were

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,829
in place when it started 25 years ago

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,390
and yet there's been a renaissance over

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,180
the last decade let's call the last 10

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,650
to 12 years where JavaScript has just

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,599
been ascendant and is actually

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,390
accelerating and its importance in the

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,430
ecosystem and so when we start to ask

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,290
the question of why especially in the

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,209
case of a company like ours a team like

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,940
ours that's making a bet on JavaScript

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,370
as the foundation of what we do we need

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,590
to understand why it has become so

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,730
central to the way that all of us work

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:19,299
and what we realized is JavaScript has

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,970
become a network maybe even a network of

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,380
networks and that's not an obvious

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,700
statement to make we can talk about as a

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,200
language we can talk about it as a

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,639
runtime when we talk about there's a lot

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,950
of different things but talking about

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,230
JavaScript as a network is a little bit

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,209
well controversial to some people so I

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,859
won't explain why I say that in what

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,160
ways is JavaScript a network what does

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,840
that even mean well take a look at the

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,760
period in which JavaScript has taken off

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,410
over the last decade and see what other

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,120
tools and technologies and platforms

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,450
have been ascended at the same time

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,519
let's look at sharing answers with you

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,130
let's look at sharing answers with each

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,230
other on Stack Overflow let's look at

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,630
sharing code on github and the other

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,519
places that we store our code and let's

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,590
look at the ability to reuse each other

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,030
each other's work easily with NPM and

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,829
there are many many other tools that can

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,419
fall into these categories but these are

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,519
the ones that are sort of anchors to

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:12,400
this experience and what you find is

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,400
there are networks effects building

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,900
around coding in JavaScript that are

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,190
unlike anything we've seen before and

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,500
really unlike anything in any other

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,030
language because while obviously there

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,729
are tons of different languages used on

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,810
github and tons of different languages

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,750
that get your questions answered on

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,880
Stack Overflow

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,350
we're not seeing that same network

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,820
effect take places we're seeing in

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,920
JavaScript where it's becoming the glue

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,250
that binds really almost the whole

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,440
programming world together in fact if we

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,290
want to understand these behaviors and

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,630
the shape of the activity around

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,370
JavaScript it starts to look more like

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,900
almost a social network

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,520
it looks like the apps we use to keep in

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,530
touch with our friends or that we use to

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,760
share photos it doesn't follow the

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,320
typical pattern of a programming

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,940
language especially because most

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,220
languages of a certain age start to

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,680
crescendo and then decrease in

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,850
popularity they become irrelevant but

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,130
that's not the case here so now when we

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,960
start to think of maybe there is a

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,630
social network that is formed around

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,070
JavaScript the question arises of whose

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,990
network is it who is it designed for who

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,820
had the idea to create these things at

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,470
whose welcome on that network and these

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,800
questions are important because we've

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,630
had those same questions arise on

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,150
conventional social networks right we

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,790
think of well a lot of times the flaws

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,040
in my case I think of say Instagram

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,870
having filters for many years that

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,210
didn't work for my skintone or a lot of

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,100
other people's skin tones or I think of

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,350
Twitter and how long it took for them to

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,140
address issues of abuse or harassment on

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,930
the platform or platforms like Facebook

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,310
or whatsapp or YouTube and how much

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,610
they've struggled with misinformation

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,540
that has led to real harm in the world

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,500
social networks can have a lot of

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,000
unexpected side effects and if the

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,620
programming languages that we're using

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,440
are becoming part of a sort of

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,820
equivalent to a social network well then

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,750
we have to understand who that network

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,760
was designed for and who it serves just

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,070
as importantly we have to think about

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,600
the ideas that underpin the creation of

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,130
these networks because there are a lot

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,410
of assumptions that go into creating any

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,169
technology sometimes they are a common

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,110
set of values sometimes there are common

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,210
set of delusions and in either case it's

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,090
really really important to understand

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,350
what those assumptions are so that we

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,979
know what it is are actually building

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:36,530
together I think the values often get

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:40,009
expressed as stories and so we can ask

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,740
the question of what stories do we tell

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,300
and I grew up in a time when even before

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,279
open source had become as popular as it

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,020
would become or as much the default and

00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,580
how we collaborate together and there

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,289
were narratives that were told that one

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,879
of the phrases that kept coming up all

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,189
the time that open source was valuable

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,949
because many eyes make all bugs shallow

00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,899
and then a lot later people talked about

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,490
how software was becoming more

00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,020
influential in the world and we start to

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,089
hear that phrase software is eating the

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,529
world there are lots of other sort of

00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,719
pithy phrases like these but I think

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,830
these out is two of the most common that

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,259
you tend to hear especially at

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,360
conferences like this one but also just

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,849
in the general discussion about how

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,370
software technology the tools that we

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,949
use and the tools that we make are

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,319
impacting the world around us one of the

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,270
biggest questions is are the goals of

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,210
the people that share these stories the

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,839
same as the goals that we have I'm not

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,139
so sure because when we think about a

00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:37,330
network being created and we think about

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,639
what the negative and positive

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,020
implications could be we have to really

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,749
really interrogate that question because

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,969
there's a non-obvious truth here which

00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:49,399
is that networks have power and power

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,649
exists in a context and that power can

00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,169
be conveyed to the people who are on the

00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:57,259
network or can be denied the people who

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,240
are excluded from that network there's a

00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:00,559
lot of these dynamics that I think

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,939
actually are really obvious to us when

00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,589
we think about social networks but are

00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:07,129
not obvious to us when we think about

00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,769
programming language networks give me a

00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,149
small example I've had this peer

00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:12,469
experience a number of times probably

00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,930
all of you have had this if you've been

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,789
coding for more than a few years where I

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,639
picked a toolkit framework that I really

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,589
like and I made it part of my standard

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,199
dev setup and that was how I had started

00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,029
up new projects and at first it was

00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,949
awesome because I got really good at it

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,199
and I felt like I could just you know

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,639
whip up an app really quickly that would

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,810
solve my needs or that would feel like

00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,839
it was really productive and rewarding

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:38,630
to me and then after a while I noticed

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,550
that I would get sort of you know

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,329
teasing jokes from other people and they

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,050
were kind of kidding kind of not or

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,610
people start saying oh you're still

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,110
using that framework because there's

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,569
like the new hotness and I don't know

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,730
why you haven't moved on to it and it

00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:53,570
started to feel like being frankly out

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,700
of fashion

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,260
it's a little weird way to think about a

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,230
programming framework but it was

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,490
definitely that sense that the network

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,470
was moving on without me

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,130
and it manifested in a lot of different

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,800
ways we start to see fewer updates on

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,240
that toolkit from the creators you know

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,250
whether they're the core committers or

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,750
the company that owns it you know that

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,360
framework starts to become something

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,460
that decays over time that framework

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
starts to become something where the

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,770
documentation comes a little bit out of

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,900
date and that's just a minor example

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,090
that was just something where I felt

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,070
honestly a little bit coerced into I

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,380
better move on to a new framework this

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,240
thing is well not the thing I should use

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,390
anymore even though it still solves the

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,030
problem that I wanted it to solve but

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,250
there are a lot deeper problems that can

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,810
come from the network having this impact

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,480
on us especially if you think about the

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,950
idea software eating the world because

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,010
the network impacts people who are not

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,740
coders and not programmers you know the

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,420
truth is the world of non coders has

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,670
started to think of us as authorities on

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,280
domains that we don't necessarily know

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,080
anything about what you think about data

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,170
we know it is something that is dirty

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,790
and often inaccurate and often has the

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,820
same bugs as the software that created

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,250
it right we know it's imperfect but

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,470
outside of the role of coders people

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,430
treat data as if it were authoritative

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,010
and correct

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,810
they treat it like it's the truth we

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,890
would never assume the data we get or

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,360
the truth and so that's a lesson that's

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,930
often not obvious to people who don't

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,880
code and that keeps repeating in more

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,320
and more serious ways the network of

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,960
programmers in the world is having

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,620
impact on spaces that we didn't even

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,260
know we would impact one of the ones

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,630
that jumps out to me most clearly it's

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,330
going back a few years ago several years

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:52,370
ago now when I first started hearing

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:56,570
about the increased attention to police

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,640
violence here in the United States and a

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,790
lot of the solutions that were proposed

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,700
going back years and years now involve

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,070
technology they involve things like body

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,780
cameras for the police

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,390
and the idea was that well to use the

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,190
programmers phrase many eyes make bugs

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,310
shallow the idea is that lots of people

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,320
seeing and witnessing police violence

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,740
happening would cause it to stop

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,980
happening and truthfully until four or

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,060
five years ago I believe that too

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,800
because it had been framed in the

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,200
rhetoric of the software industry the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,580
technology that was eating the world I

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,440
bought into it

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,000
I believed well you know this might fix

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,570
these problems this might fix these bugs

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,170
in society and the truth is as we've

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,450
painfully seen it doesn't there were

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,460
some incorrect assumptions here using

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,750
the logic of software in a world that

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,270
has nothing to do with software it

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:56,120
doesn't work using a technological

00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,470
solution to a problem that is cultural

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,020
and social doesn't work and I didn't

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,790
catch it I didn't want to see it I

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,840
wanted to believe that our technologies

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:14,030
would help and there was a deeper lesson

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:16,130
here which is that violence wasn't seen

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,190
as a bug by the systems was being

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:23,600
reported to the videos could show up and

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:26,510
they wouldn't fix the problem technology

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,740
was not the answer and so there are

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,920
limits to these networks there are

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,530
limits to how technology will imitate

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,410
echnology cool approaches can fix the

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,000
problems we have in society think of it

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,240
from a technology standpoint you can't

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,270
fix the lower levels of the stack

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,910
beneath the tools that you're using you

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,410
know reporting a bug is meaningless if

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,270
the institution are reporting it to

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,780
doesn't consider it a problem it won't

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,780
fix it

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,309
that's a lesson

00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,979
was painful for me to learn but not

00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:05,919
obviously nearly as painful as the

00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,789
impact that it's had on society because

00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,259
politicians believed it

00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,089
elected officials believe that many

00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,189
people believed that if we would just

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,910
apply technology to a social problem it

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:18,379
would work but it's not enough now

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,169
that's not to say that networks don't

00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:24,079
give us power they do but only in

00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:26,869
certain ways that the network of

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,579
technology that we create can move power

00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:31,249
around within people in that network but

00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:34,399
it can't bring new people in right and

00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:35,839
it also can't challenge us to

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,779
interrogate what are the assumptions

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,479
that network was built around because as

00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,759
painful as that example was there's also

00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:46,819
a lot of power there's honestly a lot of

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,459
hope that I see because you know we joke

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:51,259
about the size of there are node modules

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,999
directory right and and how it's so easy

00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,049
to just pull down you know gigabytes of

00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,410
code that we don't even know what

00:13:54,049 --> 00:14:00,799
they're doing but the truth of it is we

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,959
can instantly almost automatically reuse

00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,029
the work of thousands of other coders

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,470
around the world millions of lines of

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:11,089
code it's almost automatic to be able to

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,649
not just stand on the shoulders of

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,499
giants but take advantage of the

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:18,919
brainpower and the generosity of

00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,299
programmers around the world and I think

00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,089
about the way we share code and share

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,019
your answers with each other and it's

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,119
it's almost like we take it for granted

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,149
but this is an extraordinary act of

00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:31,100
kindness that coders extend to one

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,829
another it's it's actually the most

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,109
positive and optimistic sense of the

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,759
work that we could do is to say I hope a

00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,949
stranger might find this valuable

00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,749
someday and that it lightens their load

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,879
it makes them more able to create the

00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:48,259
things they want to create I mean that

00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:52,879
is honestly well that's the promise of

00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:54,619
technology right and so there are two

00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,399
sides to this there is this great

00:14:54,619 --> 00:15:01,039
optimistic and altruistic sense of how

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,350
we share our great technologies with one

00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,999
another but there's also that reality we

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,519
all know where even aside from the

00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:09,049
profound social ills we know every open

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,299
source libraries might have bugs in it

00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,720
we've all seen times when a bug goes on

00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,240
fixed for years and years

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
nobody looked at that code you know the

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,660
theory might be many eyes make bugs

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,570
shallow but a lot of times many eyes are

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,190
looking at something else we keep

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,820
assuming somebody else is going to fix

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:32,510
that bug and a lot of times somebody

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:34,440
else thinks we're going to and that is

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,900
what we have to really challenge

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,570
ourselves on because we have also seen

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,280
the positive potential all of us have

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:45,090
had that moment where a bug gets fixed

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,760
for us almost for free right the we do

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,170
an update of our you know dependencies

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,370
and all of a sudden that thing that we

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,800
have been struggling with is fixed

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,420
almost magically we are able to extend

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,300
that to each other to the people that

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,070
are already in the network and it does

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,620
feel like magic I mean I think about

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,900
even just from a language standpoint the

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,570
fact that we talk about dependencies we

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,120
depend on one another to help each other

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,870
out to solve our problems to fix our

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,610
bugs but we only extend that to the

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,710
small number of people who are able to

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:23,220
clear the hurdles to be part of a

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:25,550
community like this one so I've tried to

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,210
challenge myself a little bit about

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:33,120
whose choices I am accepting

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,280
unquestioningly you know the truth is

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,690
every day I use tools made by

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,730
organizations that I don't agree with

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,340
every day I use software and code made

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,160
by companies that I would like to not

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:47,010
support and I feel the other side of

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,690
that very acutely - you know I work at a

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,690
company where a glitch we do hope you

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,160
use our tools but I know that people

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,170
need to make their own judgments about

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,490
do I feel good now using these tools do

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,040
I feel like I'm supporting something I

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,089
can believe in and so we've pushed

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,310
ourselves at the ground can we have a

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:03,690
business model that doesn't involve you

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,220
know surveillance based business models

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,540
we're not doing creepy things with

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,040
people's data we're not you know

00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,760
reselling their information somebody

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,680
else but it's hard because we also have

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,790
to compete against companies that do do

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,189
those things and so we end up with

00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:23,130
imperfect answers I am NOT preaching

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:25,380
about we do the one right thing by any

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,430
means I'm not pointing any fingers at

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,610
anybody that I couldn't point

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,080
myself I just think that we have to push

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,140
each other to work a little bit harder

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,670
you can think a little bit harder about

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,650
who is making the choices around the

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,440
technologies that we use who were

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,240
supporting when we use them and who

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,160
we're excluding when we strengthen our

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,930
networks and give power to our networks

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,380
but don't think about who is excluded

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,640
from those networks what I'm hoping is

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,760
that we can challenge each other and

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,130
that we can see our acts of creation and

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,170
collaboration encoding and take pride

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,240
rightfully and the fact that there is

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,550
such a generous spirit you know I see it

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,710
every time I go to any event with coders

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,750
there is just this general genuine sense

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,920
of camaraderie and a willingness to

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,330
share knowledge to share insights but a

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,290
lot of times we don't push hard enough

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,430
around thinking about how others take

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,600
the code we make the ideas we share

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,900
apply for the problems that may not be

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,060
appropriate for apply them in situations

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,220
that we didn't anticipate and cause real

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,990
harm and so we need to lift that

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,880
importance of those ideas we need to

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,070
challenge each other about our

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,420
responsibility to one another and I

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,870
think most importantly we need to

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,670
remember that we don't code alone we are

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,290
always coding in collaboration with

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,570
thousands or millions of people around

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,090
the world and we are also always

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,540
creating an environment there are

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,920
billions more who don't have a say we

00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,220
have to be mindful of the fact that we

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,010
are part of a network a community that

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,870
has a tremendous amount of power and we

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,650
have to be responsible in the ways that

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,450
we wield that power I'm gonna challenge

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,520
myself to try and do better in those

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,130
regards and I'm gonna ask all of you to

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,980
do the same and I hope we'll each hold

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,240
each other accountable as we do I hope

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,040
that we'll deliver on the promise that

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,870
we all had the first time we ever wrote

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,910
a line of code that we thought we could

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,980
make something useful we thought we

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,810
could solve real problems we thought we

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,150
can maybe even make the world a little

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,770
bit better and I think if we hold each

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,410
other accountable that's exactly what

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,410
