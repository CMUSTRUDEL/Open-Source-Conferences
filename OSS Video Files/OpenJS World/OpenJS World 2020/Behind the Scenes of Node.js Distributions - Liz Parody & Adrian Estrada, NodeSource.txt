hi everyone my name is Lisa Fadi I work

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:11,450
as developer relations here at NASA

00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:14,030
Al I'm addressed rather I am the VP of

00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:17,750
engineering and outsource and today we

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:24,020
go behind the scenes of notes there's no

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:27,110
genius distributions the agenda for

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,210
today we start about an intersection

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,180
then a little bit of history of her

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,070
notes first got involved in this project

00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,100
the process of how a new releases

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,100
creative English no June side and also a

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,290
bit notes recites the nuts and bolts in

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,750
ball and sounded the manager used to

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:48,620
support this project some very

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,450
interesting SPAC also recently to spores

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,550
and traffic peaks when there's a new

00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,650
release and how you can get involved and

00:00:52,550 --> 00:01:00,740
conclusions at the end notes there's no

00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,950
G binary distributions man things the

00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:07,189
availability and allows the usage of no

00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,409
genius inventor Linux community if

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,810
you're selling no genius in production

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,280
in a Linux platform there is a big

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,640
chance that you're using notes

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,530
associative binary distribution a binary

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,229
distribution is an awkward package

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,899
containing executable binaries or

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,079
programs that are ready to be executed

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:31,520
in this case it would be known and NPM

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,959
compiled cuticles but now you would be

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,450
wondering why is this important well

00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,749
note sirs no J's binary distributions

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:45,709
was not noted over 50 million times

00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:48,799
world while last year there's 50 million

00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:52,249
times people have been able to use learn

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,729
interact with no giant thanks to this

00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:58,880
project just as fun it wasn't eleven

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,039
million times and basically millions and

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,099
applications and web pages are using it

00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,590
because of its availability East has

00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:09,289
proven over two years to be the best

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,410
source of installation and extensive use

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:16,330
of notice in Linux allowing the

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:18,959
expansion of it to use in the market

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,240
okay so

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,670
you may be wondering what kind of

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,330
distributions are supported so right now

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:31,800
we have this slide as you can see we

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,380
four major Davian room to RedHat centers

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,110
on federal releases and many different

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,720
distribution space and those as you can

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,510
see you know the list can't go really

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,420
very long but we are always trying to

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,489
add more there we are going to see later

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,120
in the talk how we you know how this

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,120
process works

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,209
also if you are using coal as

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,709
infrastructure the major recipes or

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:04,080
formulas or plugins that includes you

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,620
know not J's insulation usually work

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,160
using not G is not religious by

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,569
religions so you're using this ansible

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,610
check prepared salt you're already using

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:21,300
nudges not religious and are

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,829
distributions if you linux is

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,140
recommended by me

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,420
not since Tyler does what the NPM

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,670
documentation sets also what they know

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,280
Gia's official documentation says so

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,870
it's proven to be the best source of

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,880
installing these packages ok let's talk

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,880
a little bit about the history of this

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,640
project how not to actually got about so

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,950
here are an important miles or project

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,470
everything start with grizzly he was

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:58,410
actually supporting a PP April 1 to 2014

00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:01,799
he was the main source of not J's 401 to

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,500
and basically he joined forces with

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,329
doctors in 2014 to create this project

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,630
so initially we started supporting

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:12,780
Debian and we're going to win not gs-12

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:16,169
zero point well I mean and we were also

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,780
supporting 0.10 really early version and

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,630
a couple of months later we start

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,100
supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,849
Santos Fedora

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,170
Oracle engine Amazon Linux which is the

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:32,080
nerve center pride distributions

00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:35,770
later we created a script to make the

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,370
process to insult easier because you had

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,030
to manually add the TPPA now everything

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,430
is automated and later when IJ's was

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,400
born we immediately start supporting a

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,820
sporting decree you know the port that

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,200
lead to create the foundation later we

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,990
did the same with every LTS and stable

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,350
reasons that not just president has been

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,740
releasing and in 2018 we started

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,290
delivering nudges in snap packages which

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,270
is a compelling format with multiple

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,550
energy solutions that you can use and

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,040
since then we have been expanding

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,060
support for many compatible dinners

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,670
distributions now let's talk about the

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,610
process of how a new release is created

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,450
there are two processing goals in a new

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,930
version of note first one from the know

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,790
project itself

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,950
I'm the second one from the notes no

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,820
genius pioneering distributions for the

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:39,100
Linux operating system so it's useful to

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,440
understand how the release lines work

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,970
all the releases are scheduled and

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,460
planned in advance

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,380
there are three stages on a version of

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:53,020
not current deltas and the end of life

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,450
current is the most recent OGS release

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,020
line in the graph is colored in green as

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,590
we can see here and this phase lasts for

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,660
six months from April to October

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,580
LT s is an acronym for long term support

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,680
and is applied to relief lines that will

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,290
be supported and maintaining fight

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,770
energies projects for extensive period

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,700
of times

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,430
LTS divides into active and maintaining

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,900
active is the blue as we can see here

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,390
I'm maintaining integrate active is the

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,330
one that lasts for 18 months and

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,940
maintain this is a police line that is

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,470
the end of life the end of life our

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,640
persons are not going to longer

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:40,730
and not be touch with cities or books on

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,890
any known security vulnerability when a

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,560
person reaches enter why is very

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,970
advisable to upgrade the whole process

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,190
lost for three years

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,910
also there is three types of leases

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,540
major beliefs that are for incompatible

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,340
APA changes from version to version

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,830
major release can also include changes

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,770
that would normally be included minor or

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,460
patch please then we have minor please

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,780
there is backwards compatible

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,420
functionality changes and the press

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:15,110
release include non-breaking bug fixes

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:18,980
and security patches so every new LT is

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,290
a major brief this is the process for

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:26,920
the non project side now agent will

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:30,290
explain how to release happen okay so

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,380
let's get really understand how energy

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:38,000
is person screen right so every time a

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,970
new version is release it so everything

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,690
starts from not relaxed so we already

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:47,660
have an integration that naughty pious

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,060
in specific channel there is a you know

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,490
a new version available so that means we

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,919
have to get to work and during the new

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,710
version for that we have some automation

00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:01,760
in place that makes our life easier

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:04,910
right so we have a bot or infrastructure

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,000
but it's called control tower it's

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,080
something we use internally for all

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,350
everything in our infrastructure so

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,200
control tower allows to run a single

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,010
comment to generate the new version so

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,169
that will communicate with pipeline with

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,590
12 different pipelines that we have in

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,710
AWA is called pipeline and that will use

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,330
AWS code build to actually do the

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,640
building of the package and all the

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,039
packaging right it will generate all the

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,240
different banners we need to all the

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:41,000
different packages that we need to

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:44,630
distribute Debian rpm and other formats

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,500
and then after build those it will coach

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,260
to a machinist

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,330
pocket from there we have a CDN that

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,000
will serve for you know all these

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,240
packages for everybody in the world so

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,600
that's how it works actually it's a semi

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,150
automated process with a lot of

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,970
automation involved okay now let's see

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,870
some very interesting statistics

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,820
involved in this project

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,020
the total downloads of the binary

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,480
distributions last year 2018 was over 50

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,900
million times and the total mangoes from

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,160
this year from January to May is twenty

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:26,310
seven million describes is that a node

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,170
five month in terabyte whatever is equal

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,810
to a thousand and twenty four gigabytes

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,530
in generate that last year it was

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,970
another forty four terabytes of binary

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,460
distribution there is a lot of data

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,680
there is a very clear ice in Tennessee

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,940
of downloads and this year they done

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:49,980
those in just one year the increase was

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:53,000
about 85% of downloads here it hit to

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,800
pick up a hundred terabytes standards

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,380
again this is like a lot of data and we

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,390
expect this number to keep increasing in

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:05,670
the future as a node project itself

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,890
expands okay now we are going to analyze

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,940
the numbers by person so this is very

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,300
important

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,510
let's take a look this was 2008 19 right

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,660
so as you can see there is people still

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:22,200
very you know getting really old person

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,550
slice your point something um before

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,690
right

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:32,120
same as p6 which was the pre-k obviously

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:35,250
and carbon was still you know in place

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,860
last last year a lot of people you know

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,530
most people actually is getting that

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,890
version then we have 9 and 10 tens

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,250
brigade

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,210
stronger and a few people this actually

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,910
in 11 12 and 13 with it was launched

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:59,850
now let's go to analyze the current

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:03,180
stages so this is the 2020

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,120
and you know as you can see still all

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,060
people using be eight persons that

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,550
there's already duplicated but the good

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,339
news is most people it is in ten which

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,560
is supported and twelve which is the

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,529
latest LTS that we are actually

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,790
supporting and so adventurous people it

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,500
is in 13 and 14 is really good if you

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,959
want to try these things on production

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,930
is real good we are you know these are

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:35,690
stable versions but we always recommend

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:38,810
to use the latest LTS in production

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,760
now let's see where those downloads are

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,340
happening in the world and where people

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,220
are consuming now J is the most the top

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:49,610
five countries consuming no J's binary

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:54,080
distributions are the US Germany France

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:56,750
Ireland and another followed by UK China

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,330
and Canada many countries in South

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,300
America are also consuming binary as

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,880
well as Russia and Australia the only

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,600
African country on the list is South

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,430
Africa

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,430
let's hope more can just keep using

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,920
okay so here we have some recent

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,190
Diesel's that we are reporting so as

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,880
religiously inspired assembiy and ladies

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,240
cleanest mean boss puris Crisco and as

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,620
you can see many compatible

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,930
distributions we are always expanding

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,190
these lists we are always looking to add

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,960
more disciplines and you can request

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,890
support if you want later we are going

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,890
to find half

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:46,560
so it's possible to see a peak on the

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,980
day of the release of Nigeria's as we

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,570
can see in this image on June 3rd this

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,690
year it was a relief and it reached 700

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,070
megabytes per second downloads so every

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,800
time there is a new release energy is

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,610
there something on downloads with binary

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,610
distributions

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,960
to talk a little bit about whole

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,120
duplicating versions words so this

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,400
projects over two kind of duplications

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,910
so the first one is when a Nadja's

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,450
person bridge and up line so end of line

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,670
means you're not going to receive any

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,030
security update or any bit patch in the

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:32,480
future so we always recommend that you

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:35,000
stay in the current supported version we

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,950
one thing that is important to note here

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,140
is that we do not remove the old

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,330
packages so even if you are using a

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,970
pretty old version of not yet you can

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,270
still keep using notes or such as binary

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,850
descriptions but the other process is

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:53,030
when Ali distribution goes and of mine

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,800
so basically your Linux distribution

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,680
your operating system is no longer

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,160
receiving any update any security of

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,730
their support so that means we you know

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,680
we all would recommend to you keep in a

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,830
proper and untainted version of your

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,380
operating system so still we do not

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,280
remove the old package so even you you

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,070
are is not really all not like Linux

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,720
distribution then you will get support

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:26,480
to get those not judge not expect this

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,340
okay but even if you're using a pretty

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,680
old version we try to warn you right so

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,570
please update you're not Jason or you

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,970
will see this thing when you're

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,630
installing the Nadia's version that

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:45,740
you're trying to install so we present

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,870
this duplication warning and we make you

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,960
wait 20 seconds so you can read the

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,430
message and realize that maybe you

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,730
should be obtaining you're not this

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:58,070
person so as we can see if there is a

00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,950
lot of people that are using versions

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,500
that are no longer supported actually

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,140
last year do with about 5 million

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,960
downloads of no jurisdictions that were

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,210
no longer supported and we want to note

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,030
you can find this a great you know Joe's

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,280
version so here what we have for the

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,420
future so we are going to start sporting

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,820
flat-pack packages it's a new way to

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,690
packages for different lineage

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,190
distributions

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:29,950
actually it's a very good idea so we are

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,230
going to start in this format also we

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,080
are going to work to support social

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,060
enterprise which is a major lien

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,380
distribution that is no longer covered

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,150
by or natural no J's distributions but

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,450
we are going to work to get that done

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:50,100
and as usual we're going to continuously

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:53,830
expand the compatible distributions

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,530
support so if you want to have a

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,720
distribution supported you can go

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,750
directly to the project and this is

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,340
going to explain how to get involved so

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,490
how can you get involved in this project

00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:09,010
there are many ways to contribute first

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,350
you can go to this link this is the

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,410
repository of where the project is host

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,310
and you can submit me she commits an

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,650
issue or a pull request and it's mostly

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,570
supporting new distributions to upgrade

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,450
the distributions are to create an

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:28,150
update script to download a certain

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,090
distribution and iy is to keep updated

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,950
documentation even new version over

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,050
distribution changes it should be

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,920
updated on the docks as well

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,390
one is to be an issue or to request

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,890
suggestions to be made to keep

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,980
compatible with the rest of

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,320
distributions and submissions are always

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,510
working if you can run with this

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,420
progress for 3 months you can ask and

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,330
you can be included in this repo as a

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,910
collaborator some conclusions using

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,420
notes there's no genius distribution is

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,730
the best most recommended way to stop no

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,010
chickens in limits for productions

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,590
environments no source has been able to

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,280
deliver no genius fresh to your limit

00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,280
system

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,420
PR you package manager within hours or

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,820
even minutes not days or weeks of the

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,860
formal release pipe energy is project in

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:26,740
many company for its syrup in multiple

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,210
times not risk infuse expanding support

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,650
for new packages for mass and

00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,440
distribution this is very important

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,160
because we want for more people using

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,620
Linux to

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,750
not JC production also we are looking

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,150
for more community involvement in the

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,090
project so the majority of scripts are

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,700
open source and as you can see there is

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,950
a lot of activity in the report that we

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,730
just mentioned so please come join us

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:54,250
and be part of this big effort to form

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,720
multiple different distributions in M

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,899
production environments for Nigeria's

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,679
thanks for watching our turn we hope you

00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:04,649
enjoy it

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,870
I hope at the start you can understand

00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:09,570
the magnitude of this project and you're

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,100
willing to collaborate also these are

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,440
some of the notes with channels so you

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,320
can follow us hey thank you very much

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,049
for attending this talk as you can see

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,039
there is a big effort from the nutters

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:26,669
to actually bring node.js in production

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:30,889
in linear distributions so help us to

00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:32,970
reach more people at for more use cases

00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:35,309
announcer's we really care about the

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,679
node.js community are we created a new

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:41,039
platform dedicated to energy as content

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,710
news and updates in one place this is

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,929
divided into four sections pedia blogs

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,210
no Jigga's binary which is the talk we

00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:50,070
just did our community where we're going

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,379
to celebrate keep people in the no

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:57,440
genius ecosystem you're welcome to

00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:57,440
explore read and be part of this project

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:06,259
thank you thank you very much see you
