hey everyone I am so excited for my

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,280
discussion today at the open GIS world

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,599
keynote interview with Alan worst Brock

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,660
of worse Brock associates Alan was a

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,150
project editor of ACMA script

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,160
specification from 2008 to 2015

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,670
Alan thank you so much for joining us

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,019
thanks it's great to be here

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,369
[Music]

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,689
open Jas conference now Alan you're

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,489
gonna have to tell us a little bit about

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,260
this paper and the conference that was

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,149
supposed to be a part of it was supposed

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,879
to be about from the history of

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,730
programming language conference that

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,800
happens every 15 years but it couldn't

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,420
happen this year tell us a little bit

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,670
about this fascinating college that

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,520
makes me think of Tolkien almost yeah

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,860
well the ACM Association the Computing

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,410
Machinery holds this conference it's

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,719
every 12 to 15 years depending on how

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,219
they get organized and it tries to get

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,019
into the conference the people who are

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:10,049
involved with major programming

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:13,500
languages to write down and document how

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,560
that language came to be to provide the

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,720
history of really a record of where we

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,729
came from and so as we go forward people

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,290
understand why things are the way they

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,720
are I really like to borrow from Douglas

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,090
Crockford who you write about in your

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,100
paper and Douglas Crockford was very

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,479
instrumental in in the evolution of

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,420
JavaScript and he said it's JavaScript

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,790
is the most misunderstood programming

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,630
language well it's you know it starts

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,240
with the name right because it has Java

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,340
in its name so people assume that it has

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,920
something to do with the Java

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,860
programming language yeah technically

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,810
it's a very very different language and

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,110
is designed to do different sorts of

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,259
things but people come into it expecting

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,810
it to be like Java and a visit now the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,119
reason that actually goes back to the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,640
really very origins of the language

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,830
because in 1995

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,370
Netscape was trying to introduce for the

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,740
first time programming into the

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,480
capabilities that people developing web

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,760
pages had before that all there was was

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,290
HTML declarative HTML and they thought

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,090
they would do that with a scripting

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,910
language but at the same time that

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,850
happened Sun Microsystems came along

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,200
with the Java programming language

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,750
incited promoting it for a web

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,090
technology and so they're within

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,520
Netscape there was essentially kind of

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,830
this race between the simple scripting

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,650
language in this more complex language

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,200
that Sun was was promoting and in the

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,239
end there was sort of an internal deep

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,080
they thought that said what we will do

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,060
both will incorporate Java and but will

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,370
also have this simpler scripting

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,080
language to not confuse the world

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,769
although it ended up doing just the

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,940
opposite

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:11,610
well we'll name the language JavaScript

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,220
to make it appear that they're tightly

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,350
integrated now you wrote in the you

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,880
wrote in the book that Brendan Eich

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,600
recalls that the rallying cry

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,459
articulated by Marc Andreessen who was

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,910
at Netscape at the time and is famous

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,489
for his time there was saying Netscape

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,250
plus Java kills Windows which seems to

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,530
me now kind of funny because this was

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,820
really more discussion if you think of

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,290
back about really the kind of the

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,190
conversation is more about the web

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:46,709
really you know then grand Java versus

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:50,100
windows it was Microsoft in Windows that

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,120
was dominating all of personal computing

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:57,060
and stuff and and for anything new to be

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,180
in the news that wasn't originating with

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,700
with Microsoft was very unusual and very

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,609
difficult to accomplish and stuff and so

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:12,420
if you think of the web as a new

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:15,329
different sort of platform that platform

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,479
to some degree needed to compete with

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,970
Windows and so that's part of that

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,260
slogan really then what were the impacts

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,840
of javascript at the time what

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,840
about it showed how deeply integrated it

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,000
was into the web stack that how did that

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,300
distinguish it from Java yeah that was

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,870
really probably the biggest difference

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,480
Java was its world unto itself it it

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:45,010
wasn't really native to the web it was a

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,200
add-on to the to the web and Suns you

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:51,070
know their slogan was right once one

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,320
every run everywhere and it would run

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,260
the same in the browser as it would on a

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,870
desktop as it would on a server and it

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,000
was Java that was defining everything

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,130
about the world what the UI would be

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,480
like how you interact with it and stuff

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,350
JavaScript as it was developed at

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:15,130
Netscape it was highly integrated with

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,650
with the native web technologies the

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,380
first versions of JavaScript the only

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:24,760
way to include JavaScript code was

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,740
computed inline within your HTML files

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,440
right there was script tags

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,840
kanpei JavaScript but there wasn't the

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,630
option to point off at an external file

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,810
containing your code it had to be there

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:42,780
right in line and then the interface

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:46,840
from JavaScript into the the browser

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,210
technologies into HTML Javascript

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,490
essentially invented the Dom at the same

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,460
time javascript has been invented the

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,370
Dom was invented and so when you program

00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:01,360
the JavaScript you directly manipulated

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,790
the same abstractions the same concepts

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,720
that were you used when you wrote the

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,430
HTML so now looking back on it before we

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,110
get into the discussions about the

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,470
standard because things were developing

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,070
so rapidly at this time but who are the

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,340
people who what was it about this group

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,790
of people that made them so unique for

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,810
the time what was it about them that

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,290
that really do you think is special

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,910
because javascript and some respect has

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,850
always been underrated but this was

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,860
actually a time when there was just

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,520
really kind of intense innovation

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,229
happening

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,810
what is it that you reflect upon about

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:46,660
this group of people successful like

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,479
Brendan with JavaScript was people who

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,930
kind of understand what their piece of

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,990
the technology fit into everything that

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,870
was going on around them so you know

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,900
trying to make a system that they're

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,020
part of work versus there's always lots

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,270
of people who have their own thing their

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,909
own technology they developed and try to

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,780
find a way cool can I use this new thing

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:17,050
to leverage what I when I'm pushing or

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,620
what I'm devoted to and stuff and so I I

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:24,789
think case of the web was the people who

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,099
really embraced and well you embrace the

00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,370
ugliness if you will as the web there's

00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:34,419
a phrase worse than better we originated

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:37,090
from Richard P Gabriel who's one of the

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:39,639
developers of common list but he's

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,520
basically saying the technologies that

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,169
tend to succeed are those that are just

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,990
barely good enough they're good enough

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:50,199
to get the job done but they don't try

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,840
to be the best possible solution and

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,820
those those tend to be the most

00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,300
successful

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,490
no worse is better and this also was a

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,290
time when you know now that you were

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,810
opening up you know the browser for

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,670
programming you were thinking it as a

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,380
wet as a web stack but there were all

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,290
kinds of different developers who were

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,840
you know building things and are all had

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,420
to work together right and so now you

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,300
have this what you call browser game

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,310
theory developing and how how did that

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,520
manifest in creating a standard and I

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,250
want to move into that party this person

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,970
really started with as soon as as soon

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,669
as JavaScript was introduced he had

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,070
Microsoft who was trading Internet

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:40,120
Explorer to compete with with Netscape

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,010
and the original HTML they kind of had

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,180
to be the same but now there is this new

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,090
thing javascript and if you didn't if

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,210
Microsoft didn't have JavaScript in in

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:54,670
IE and Internet Explorer then web pages

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,750
that use JavaScript wouldn't work in

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:01,510
Internet Explorer so so you know even

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:06,820
though they hated the idea they wanted

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:09,910
people to use to use BC for scripting

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:15,210
and stuff they they realize they had to

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:17,470
provide JavaScript to simply or people

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,100
webpages wouldn't work and the whole

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,770
point of the web was anybody could

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,410
create these pages and anybody can have

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:29,410
a browser and there were multiple people

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,730
building browsers and so you had to have

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,230
the same technology and all of them and

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,500
part of what we call a browser game

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,560
theory is this idea that if you are if

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:46,540
you're a Netscape or a Microsoft or a--

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,050
or a mozilla or even a google and you

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,350
have this great idea for browser feature

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,870
and you add it in you add a new part of

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,240
the technology scrap staff that a

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,990
developer could use well if it's only in

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,460
your browser nobody trying to use it

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,800
yeah and it really then laid the

00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,650
foundation for lava but technologies

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,720
that we see today and how we think about

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,850
activity really I think you know that

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,260
the most abstract in terms of how you

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,880
think about you know we hear a lot of

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,290
discussions today about microservices

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,970
you know all the components that must

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,490
have work together but here we're

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,160
talking about the browser and so the

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,320
standards became incredibly important so

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,670
you say that they were essentially what

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,620
we started to see was like this

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,750
bifurcation though there were these two

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,730
separate design efforts that were

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,650
happening what happened there

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,590
so Brendon Knight created basically

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:43,300
created the first versions of JavaScript

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,700
and that was copied fairly closely by by

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,590
Microsoft and other people who were

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,980
working on browsers and stuff in that

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,940
and that then led into the creation of a

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:58,060
official standards effort under Emma and

00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,250
for the first four or five years through

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,500
what's called Ekman script three most of

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:08,020
what that committee did was was simply

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,050
rubber stamp Brendon's design we had

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:15,030
clean up clean up some rough su rough

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,560
edges clarified some things that were

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,170
not clear but it was really the original

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:25,000
design work was Brendan Ikes

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:27,700
but by the time in 1999 when neckl

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,670
script 3 was was completed Brendan was

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:35,590
was had gone off to help create Mozilla

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,890
Netscape was in decline as a company

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:42,040
Microsoft's market share was was growing

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,050
and it was had less interest in in

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,390
JavaScript that the Standards Committee

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,090
was still there and it was responsible

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,250
for moving the language forward but

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,620
nobody on the committee had actually

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,800
done any design work with the language

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,850
before they they'd only sort of done

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,550
maintenance and now suddenly they had

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,950
the job of trying to move the language

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,630
forward you know so now we then came

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,430
into the next phase of it of your book

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,990
where there's the failed Reformation

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,870
when we started to see the difference

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,980
between really those web technologists

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,310
versus the more traditional Sigma

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,280
colleges who said this is just not

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,430
really applicable you know really this

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,800
doesn't make any

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,120
sends to our you know to a judicial

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,339
technology practices essentially if you

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,960
go back to worse is better you can you

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,050
kind of say well the worst is better

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,660
people launched her web to the point it

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,630
was was well on the way to taking over

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,920
the world and the better is better

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,690
people came in and said well this is

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,490
this is kind of ugly this isn't so good

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,660
we could do better than this

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,790
let's in many cases let's start over and

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,170
see if we can replace what's there was

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,690
something better and this wasn't just

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,500
happening with JavaScript it was at the

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:07,700
same time XHTML was being introduced and

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,360
the w3c even said I think it was in 1998

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:15,080
that HTML was going to be put into

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,860
maintenance mode and that hopefully

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,870
nobody was gonna create any new EML

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,240
pages anymore and stuff well similar

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,980
thing was going on in the standards

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,160
group this JavaScript they say not work

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,570
we're gonna create this new thing from

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,060
script four and it's going to be a

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:36,110
serious programming language and we're

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,200
going to you know do all the technology

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,620
we have available that all the academic

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,910
programming academic language designers

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,529
have come up with that we're going to

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,440
apply this really gonna make a good

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:53,089
language here that's good enough for the

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,750
web you got involved in around 2007 so

00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:00,670
you were witness to some of these failed

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:03,860
or affirmations what did you find that

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,020
was noteworthy now I mean you talked a

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,000
little bit about it in the book perhaps

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,000
you could highlight some of those for us

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,720
technologies is so I actually came from

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,600
a small talk background and one of the

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,910
things I recognized there was that when

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,430
people try to drastically change the

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,370
language to fix a perception that

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,290
usually didn't work out because for

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,480
various reasons it because the like it

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,459
didn't delay which technology didn't fit

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,769
together and the

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,959
Justin users wouldn't adopt it and so

00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,309
when I was asked to look at what was

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,889
going on with equi script

00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,929
standardization and I kind of recognized

00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:47,230
as one of these situations where

00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:50,769
somebody is taking what was a dominant

00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,470
versus better style solution and saying

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:55,480
we're gonna fix this and the way we're

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,869
fix it here is a whole long list of

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,139
things that are kind of fundamental to

00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:04,629
what the existing language is so static

00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:08,230
typing versus dynamic typing for

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:10,769
examples this was a big one but really

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,509
picked this long list of features and

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,309
we're going to change the language so it

00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:18,459
embraces all these other things and that

00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:20,199
was where I said well efforts in the

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,689
past I've seen to do this with other

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,740
languages tended to have not worked out

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:29,920
that's why I personally thought it was

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:34,420
worthwhile trying to get things on

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,339
course of one more where you build upon

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,319
what you already had there in JavaScript

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,259
and what the developer community was

00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,959
doing and what they were used to and yes

00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,670
recognizing there are improvements that

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,059
could be made things that could be added

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,459
but they had to be done in a way that

00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:53,679
preserved the existing web or as we now

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,329
say in the standards area don't break

00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,379
the web it had to be done in a way that

00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:02,939
didn't break the web so you were part of

00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:07,480
the 3.1 working group crack what

00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:09,910
impacted es6 out of 3.1 well the big one

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,499
did was showed that there was an

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:17,199
alternative to this complete redo effort

00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:19,089
that was es4 showed that was practical

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,629
to do something that was incremental

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,579
building upon the existing standards and

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:27,249
the existing language system used and

00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:29,139
that there could be agreement among the

00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:32,139
people in the standards group and among

00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:35,649
the people who build browsers on how to

00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:38,470
move JavaScript forward in an

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:42,399
incremental way feature-wise there was a

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:45,699
few new things in yes-yes-yes 3.1

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,309
eventually was named es5 but so there

00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:52,360
was a few incremental things like the

00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:54,100
addition of Jason support and what have

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,230
you but the most important thing about

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,199
it was saying here's a way we could go

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,529
forward here here's here's a way we

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,990
could work together on the foundation we

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:08,919
have and add to it

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,419
now we're 2020 so what are the

00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,270
developments that you're following now

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:15,549
why they related to JavaScript who are

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,850
the people that you're following what is

00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:24,130
this story that you're following as it

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:27,579
moves forward well so JavaScript now is

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,679
completely different when I first got

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,149
involved there was literally a handful

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,929
of people who were involved in

00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:37,389
JavaScript standards and over the course

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,419
of development of Atma script 6 there

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,010
was really only about there was various

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:45,549
people involved but there's really only

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,440
about 10 people involved it continuously

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,899
through the effort to really set the

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,970
direction now because of the success of

00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:53,950
that and the success of JavaScript

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,080
that's come on to it it's probably over

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,139
a hundred people who are officially

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,779
registered as participants now in the

00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:04,289
equus crypt standardization process so

00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:06,580
it becomes a much more different

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:09,250
different thing and there's lots of

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,470
people now each with their own idea of

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,080
what direction to go and so it's it's

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,870
it's it's a it's a more difficult

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,100
process to move things forward because

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,929
of that popularity

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,600
one of the problems with programming

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,520
languages is if you add too many

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,529
features even if they're all good

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,760
features of language itself becomes too

00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:34,840
complex so I think the balance today and

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,899
going forward is one of cheesing what

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,510
are the really important things to add

00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,399
and there definitely have been a few

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,230
over the last five years that are really

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,940
important and there are others that

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,429
people are thinking about but there are

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,320
so many good ideas and you can't add

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:53,020
them all and when you're dealing with a

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,659
large group of contributors it's hard

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,809
it's hard to search those out because

00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,740
people don't become involved with a

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:03,040
language effort these

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,860
after standardization effort to not do

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,940
stuff they come there too oh this is my

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,540
opportunity to to add my favorite

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,300
feature to the language everybody does

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,130
that you get a mess well Alan I want to

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,679
thank you very much for taking the time

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,559
to talk with us for the open J's world

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,200
keynote interview Alan worst Brock who

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,850
was project editor of the atmosphere

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:35,410
specification from 2008 to 2015 and the

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,059
author of the book sighs journal ACM

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,640
history of programming languages

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,370
conference so we're coming up with a
