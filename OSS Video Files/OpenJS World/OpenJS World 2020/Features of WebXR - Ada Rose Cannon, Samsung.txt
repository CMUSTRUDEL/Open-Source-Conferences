I I made a rose cannon I'm here to talk

00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,890
to you today about WebEx are

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,160
both what it can do today and was

00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,619
planned for the future

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,330
first a little about me and who I work

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,860
for

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm developer advocate for the web

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,140
browser

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,750
Samsung Internet

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Stang Internet is really good highly

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,450
customizable Android web browser

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,070
we have a focus on privacy and security

00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,460
we also have built-in tracking blocking

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,559
and extensions for ad blocking

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,809
as a developer advocate I try to help

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,809
developers with the latest features in

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,340
the web platform the build website which

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,500
meant the most of everything the web

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,390
browser can offer if you have any

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,760
questions about Samsung internet or

00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,300
while it's our please reach out to me

00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,060
either through email or social media

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,320
as well as being a developer advocate

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,930
I'm also co-chair of the w3c immersive

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,020
web working group and the immersive web

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,840
community group these two groups work

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,030
together to develop web standards for

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,630
working with immersive hardware such as

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,080
VR headsets the core part of this effort

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,320
is the web excited by API or WebEx after

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,950
short

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,050
while XR at his core an API designed to

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,200
access the sensors and displays of

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,270
immersive hardware such as VR headsets

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,219
and AR headsets

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,310
by knowing what the user is looking at

00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:44,400
we can render a scene using WebGL from

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,710
the users point of view

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,490
we can then send this view to be

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,860
displayed on the headset

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,110
that when they move their head they see

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,229
what they would be seeing if they were

00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:00,750
inside the virtual scene this is how you

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:03,240
get the virtual reality effect

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,810
remain difficult part in building these

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,390
AP is supporting the wide range of

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,240
immersive devices with their wide range

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:16,220
of capability first type of headset we

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,790
supported were immersive VR headsets

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,650
like the HTC vive and the oculus rift

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,830
sometimes of immersive VR had attended

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,750
computers and are very powerful but

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,210
usually require a direct wired

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,150
connection is usually both have very

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,610
high quality tracking and very good

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,030
graphical fidelity there are other VR

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,190
devices the old gear VR which is no

00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,830
longer supported was a very popular

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,160
headset but it was driven just by a

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,160
phone

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,260
modern standalone had sex like the

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,239
oculus quest

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,340
are similar in power because they are

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,140
also driven by phone chipset

00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,459
they have the great tracking which you

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,269
would typically find in the more

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,269
high-end headset

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,690
because of this great tracking giving a

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,790
very good mersive experience and a very

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,130
good user experience on their ease of

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,700
setting up these have proven to be a

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,970
very popular type of headset nowadays a

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:21,450
bit later than immersive VR headsets aim

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,550
immersive augmented reality headset has

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,070
also known as mixed reality

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,130
headsets like the hololens and the magic

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,470
leap there was a potential of immersive

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,140
augmented reality

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,670
these work by overlaying virtual content

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,340
onto your physical surroundings

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,780
scan your environment objects are placed

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,000
on the floor walls and tables

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,270
a very incredible experience you ever

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,260
get to have a go at it

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,350
these headsets are normally very

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,170
expensive currently they're more popular

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,660
in industry and with consumers

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,650
immersive technology isn't just about VR

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,650
headsets anymore

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,909
the beginning a popular method of

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,040
engaging users in web fear was to give

00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,069
users a preview of the virtual reality

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,900
experience on their handset so it kind

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,209
of looks like a window into the virtual

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,130
world

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,829
something which needs to be supported

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,199
today through WebEx are a few years ago

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,740
Pokemon go took the world by storm

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,770
and is still pretty popular it was a

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,830
huge commercial success and it showed

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,470
how bike we are you can combine and held

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,800
augmented reality with a really engaging

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,020
user experience build a fantastic

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,599
product

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,330
and this is just enough this is another

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,470
kind of experience the WebEx our device

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:53,980
API should find support

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,620
and these examples really show that the

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,870
mersive content in the web isn't just

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,450
head-mounted anymore

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,970
I mentioned just now the API called web

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,030
via

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:09,060
well fear had just targeted VR headsets

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,990
it is in the top left quarter of this

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,280
chart

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,410
because of the wide range of devices

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,200
that now needs to be supported

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,660
well VR was going to work long into the

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,430
future a new API needed to be developed

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,310
to handle augmented reality and handset

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,270
based experiences and that's where we're

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,270
XR comes in

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,430
no web PR was deprecated at the end of

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,280
last year I hope this is big at the

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,600
beginning of a long future of virtual

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,600
reality on the web

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,710
this is what virtual reality on the web

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,650
looks like today

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,980
in this example the user navigates to a

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,980
page

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,630
to be our button and then they are

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,460
placed in an immersive scene where they

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,720
can use their controllers to interact

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,580
with the world

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,030
this video was recorded in Firefox

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,970
reality the oculus quest but because it

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,400
uses WebEx ah it'll work in any BR

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,970
headset if the browser faretta supports

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,970
WebEx are

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,420
you can try it out here if you want

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,830
headset try using it in that you have a

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:27,360
cardboard headset by opening up in your

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,219
phone

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,819
trying it just on your phone and then in

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,819
the cardboard headset

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,730
it's demonstration though only shows off

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,700
the very core module of WebEx are and

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,070
there is so much more to WebEx are than

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,960
what is shown here

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,590
and that is what I aim to speak to you

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,590
about today

00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,390
the first feature i'd like to point

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,270
is a really important one

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,970
because when I recorded that demo I was

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,960
using the oculus quest headset the

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,540
controllers look like this but if you

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,620
remember that's no other controllers

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:11,409
look like in my hand in that demo

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,999
I was holding those gray sticks

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:15,369
and ideally I want to see the real

00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:18,029
hardware I'm holding in my hand in the

00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,029
virtual scene

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,500
the WebEx our device API has two things

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,610
which work together

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,689
accomplished there

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:33,270
first is the WebEx our gamepad API this

00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,990
tells you what buttons are being pressed

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,789
on the gamepad normally in WebEx are the

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,400
only events you get are the selective

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,789
end which is usually the device trigger

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,949
and the squeeze event which is from the

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,280
button usually triggered by your other

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,280
three fingers

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,540
at API if your gamepad API

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,540
representation of the controller

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,340
because it's a gamepad API it's polling

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,340
based it's not a vent Bay

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,760
um but it it behaves exactly the same as

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,410
you would expect from the JavaScript API

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,940
the only difference is that you can't

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,960
access e XR controllers from the gamepad

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,690
API itself

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,690
these are exposed on the Xin port object

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,280
the second part is a library which is

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,280
maintained by the immersive web groups

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,150
library is a complex project with three

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,140
main parts

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:40,469
has a large suite of 3d models or as

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,599
many VR controllers as we can get these

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:45,810
models are usually provided by the

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:50,330
manufacturer and they're ready to use on

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,330
the web a fully rigged for animation

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,490
you also have Jason files which describe

00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,000
how the various controller buttons from

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,500
the hardware

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,500
index the gamepad API

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,870
so that when you push the button and it

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,020
is revealed to the gamepad API

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:16,760
you know the corresponding part of the

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,760
3d model it represents

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,129
the library to help handle this

00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,129
connection

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,300
hardware vendors can update the library

00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:28,720
to add the new hardware never new

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,879
hardware is released

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,829
enables virtual reality experiences to

00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,829
continue to work well into the future

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,800
the end result is that while holding the

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,529
real hardware you have in your hand you

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,899
can see the model and the buttons on the

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,530
model will move as you press them on the

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,450
actual hardware

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:54,210
this functionality is even built into

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,440
some of the popular 3d libraries they

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,440
make it pretty simple to use

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,900
once we built this functionality it's

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:09,110
where we considered WebEx our we are

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:12,529
complete and ready to replace web via

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:16,300
study hard audio of the XR story the

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,300
other half is augmented reality

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,990
20 the reality is is bought to epochs

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,000
are by the a our module

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,480
it primarily handles making this green

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,480
transparent

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,200
by having the cameras on the outside of

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,830
the headset a their image behind your

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,830
rendered scene

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:43,089
phones it will use the rear camera

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,709
displayed the world onto the screen

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,410
my ass has set already have a

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:50,260
transparent screen and this enables it

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,480
to work on those as well

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,570
many VR headsets have externally facing

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,830
cameras do

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,720
but they only use them for position

00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,390
cracking and don't let them use them for

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,790
AR

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,090
but this is missing a key feature of

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,760
augmented reality

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,760
although you can render any content you

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,770
want on to the users environment

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,050
you don't know where in the environment

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,140
you should render it because you can't

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,120
tell whether where their tables and

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,180
walls and other objects you might want

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,430
to place objects on are

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,400
oh we need to we need to work out where

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:32,050
it is and to do this we use

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,740
a hit testing API hit testing API allows

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:39,880
you to cast array out into the world and

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,790
get the position in the real-life

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,220
position relative to the organ is

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,100
reality steam

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,939
in this video I'm placing a dinosaur in

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,379
my living room

00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:55,269
at the beginning each frame

00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,399
about the new position from the center

00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:00,179
of the screen and I will place the

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,179
dinosaur there

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,519
like at the screen

00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:09,800
stop using the hit test API and just

00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,690
leave the dinosaur over at last was

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,500
is said stays in place and I can

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,500
interact with it

00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,130
by combining the abilities and the real

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,320
world

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,290
and display virtual content over the

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,040
real world we have the cornerstones of

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:29,060
augmented reality and can build many

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,430
experiences

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,680
you can try this out in chrome today and

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,900
it'll be coming to Sam Seng internet

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,120
very soon

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,210
now we have the core features for

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,529
virtual reality and augmented reality

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,529
how do we actually build me

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:52,570
well firstly because WebEx art is WebGL

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:56,740
based you need to make a WebGL scene

00:12:52,570 --> 00:13:00,150
you can't use any HTML or CSS with WebEx

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,150
are at least not yet

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,959
the trouble with working with WebGL is

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,140
that is extremely verbose and very

00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,600
low-level

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,120
for just rendering a single cube is

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,370
hundreds of lines long

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,570
so it's best to work with a library of

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,570
which there are a few

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,030
or some of the libraries I've come

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,030
across in my day-to-day work

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,460
Regius is probably the most well-known

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:34,320
it's maintained by the community and

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,320
it's a really good BB engine

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:41,350
there's a frame a frame built on top of

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,310
3GS by providing a web component wrapper

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,590
for at

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,160
Aven Andreas is another really good 3d

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,720
engine is maintained by Microsoft and as

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,500
many features for doing high fidelity

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,500
graphics

00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:01,529
react 360 is kind of like a frame and

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,529
that is a wrapper around 3 - yeah

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,180
is a react rapper rather than a HTML

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,619
finally play canvas which is

00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:14,420
the really good 3d engine I'm gonna go

00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,730
through all of these I'm gonna show you

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,190
a frame first this is the one I probably

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,170
use most of my day today

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,320
a frame is a web component wrapper

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:27,050
around three Jas

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,279
to create a 3d scene declaratively using

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,850
HTML

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,529
do you write this this is a full HTML

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,889
document

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:42,609
tags and body tags and everything

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:45,040
and you put in elements like a box here

00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:47,050
in a cylinder

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,620
and it renders it with Webb tree out of

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,540
the skin

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,270
and since it just uses normal web

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,890
component you can control them with the

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,819
same JavaScript you would use on a

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,720
normal HTML document

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:05,929
also extremely extensible and is built

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,529
on 3GS if you're handy with JavaScript

00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:12,049
and okay with 3j s you can start writing

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:14,660
your own components but take it even

00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:18,079
further and it has a large and active

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,529
community so is the finding help isn't

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,529
too bad

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,620
out-of-the-box it's ready to use virtual

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,529
reality and augmented reality whenever

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,889
the browser support set

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:37,369
this is really incredible it's a great

00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:39,439
way to get started building um we are an

00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,729
AR if it's your first time doing any

00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,729
kind of graphics development

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,139
but since this is JavaScript conference

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:51,439
you'd probably prefer something more

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:54,610
imperative such as 3ds bothers them

00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:56,260
declarative like Avram

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,220
I'm gonna go through how to set up WebEx

00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,220
are in Twitter yes

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,670
but this is assuming you already have

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,050
some kind of VR scene set up and ready

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,209
to go in three Jas

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,690
Alton a 3GS has really good

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:14,000
documentation loads of examples and a

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,740
large and active community the finding

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,149
some boilerplate code to start from

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,149
wouldn't be too bad

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,670
once you put your seen setup

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,279
you need to import the via via button

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,819
module

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,980
this module that you get a busting

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:37,350
tournament you can add to your your

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,470
document this is the button the user

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,750
needs to start virtual reality

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,089
this is because a user interaction is

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,050
required to start to start the web

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:48,050
excite of I say I

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:54,559
thanks you need to set exile and need

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,209
this is because some laptops have

00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,100
multiple graphics card

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,120
VR headset will be driven by the more

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,920
powerful one

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,669
but if your scene is rendered on the

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,020
lower powered um graphics card then it

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,600
won't be able to be displayed on the

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,890
headset we need to make sure isn't is

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:18,170
rendered on the high power one

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,329
also need to use built-in animation

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,329
and this means he may seem strange

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,010
because if you use three GS or you've

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,260
done any kind of animation in the web

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,710
before you may be used to the

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,320
requestanimationframe api well this is

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,960
what this is using under the hood but

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,410
what Excel provides two different

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,880
animation request animation frames

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,030
there's the one for your normal monitor

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,550
the one you uses normal but there's also

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,670
the one for the headset because the

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,910
headset will have his own frame time

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,549
on the headset will run a lot faster and

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:58,549
the frame timings of your monitor

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:01,039
your headsets can run not just at 60

00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:05,710
frames per second but sometimes ninety a

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:08,889
hundred or even 140 frames per second

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:13,009
this gives you very tight budgets or

00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:16,659
rendering your scene but be wary making

00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,659
sure stuff can be rendered efficiently

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,060
but now we've covered what you can do

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,590
today

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,370
let's take a look at what's coming

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,370
around the corner

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:36,350
lastly I'd like to show you

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:38,840
don't overlay API because right now you

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:43,270
can't use HTML for anything in WebEx are

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,270
it's purely a WebGL API

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,820
daaamn overlay api will let you pick a

00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:52,070
HTML element and you can take it into

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,170
the WebEx are seen with you

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,480
is it lets you make controls and

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,750
interfaces using just hated email and

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,450
CSS which can be interacted with in the

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:06,320
usual fashion you like javascript add

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:09,470
event listeners you can let classes and

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,200
everything you would the Dom overlay API

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,870
very similar to the existing JavaScript

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,000
all screen a PA

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:22,020
the Dom overlay API similar to the

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,380
existing JavaScript will rename the user

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,539
agent will take care of wet playset so

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,659
if you're doing Ole Miss value on a

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:33,419
phone you'll probably just replace face

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,520
it fullscreen on the phone on top of

00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,600
your scene

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,810
if you're in an augmented reality

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,740
headset you'll probably a set head

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,740
locked around the you

00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,700
and it'll do other things er as well

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,410
but using HTML like this is really good

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,300
by the user-agent a way that looks much

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,570
clearer especially for doing stuff with

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,280
text it's um you'll get a much better

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,280
result than if you were just rendering

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,030
texts were bitmap texture and then

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,010
displaying it on a 3d model you also

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,430
gain access to the accessibility

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:20,920
features of HTML so it should work fine

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,920
with a screen reader and be very usable

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:28,910
that you of all the 2d layout power or

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:31,250
CSS so you can build really fancy

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,080
interfaces the kind of thing that'd be

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,070
very difficult to complete from scratch

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,070
in WebGL

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,790
nation

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,980
biting estimation enables virtual

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,090
objects to approximate the lighting from

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,880
the surrounding scene when virtual

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,309
objects are lit in a similar way to real

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,860
objects from the users environment it

00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,850
feels like there are much more natural

00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,070
part of it

00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,580
this enables a much more engaging

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,440
augmented reality experience a features

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,929
had a similar effect in which is very

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,269
subtle but gives a huge improvement

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,289
his anchors

00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,659
and I haven't got a good illustration

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:14,559
for anchors because the effect is that

00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,559
subtle

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,620
and it looks to solve an issue

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,710
Oh as a arsons run the underlying

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,920
platform and the coordinate system might

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,650
need updating

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,960
but if you do this what happens to the

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:36,170
objects you've already placed in the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,050
scene if you have to change the scale or

00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,520
slightly move it all over the object

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,020
they're going to get slightly shifted

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,020
they're gonna drift slightly

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,899
but if you place something on a table

00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:51,330
ten minutes ago and you come back to it

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:54,090
you might find it smooth by a few

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,090
centimeters and this just doesn't feel

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,660
that realistic

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:02,390
but by placing an anchor items can be

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,920
attached to that instead when the

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,990
environment is updated

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,690
the underlying system can make sure that

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:12,600
anchor stays in the same place it would

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,610
have done so any objects connected to

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,480
that anchor will also maintain their

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,430
position

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,230
this greatly increases the visual

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,590
fidelity of the scene in a very

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:28,060
subconscious way everything just feels

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:31,480
more real more anchored in reality is as

00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:34,620
you move your head stuff doesn't lowly

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:39,090
drift um or move as you look around it

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,090
it's a much better experience

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,360
this is a feature that many of the

00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:45,070
higher-end

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,230
[Music]

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,700
when Randy platforms have built-in and

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,700
it just feels really good

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,549
the next feature is layers layers are a

00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:01,309
method of its efficiency displaying

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,380
images and videos on simple shapes in

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,260
the theme

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,660
simple shapes a rectangle

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,960
inside of a cylinder or the inside of a

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,960
sphere

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,590
the rendering of these layers is handled

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,480
by the user agent instead of by using

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,650
WebGL

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,559
it provides two significant benefits

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,559
is far more efficient because you don't

00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,860
have to copy the textures from the video

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,710
element into WebGL just to render them

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,330
to the headset the user agent can just

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,600
render them directly

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,760
it also gives you clearer rendering

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,800
because they can be rendered a lot

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,490
closer to the time when the actual

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,820
people's elves light up on the screen it

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,530
gives you a much crisper experience

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,940
because they're not slowly moving as the

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,940
users eyes and head move

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,820
normally reading text in VR is something

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,030
that's not recommended and usually a

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,550
very poor experience but if you do it

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:11,060
using this technique actually not too

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:14,650
bad the text really does stay in place

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,650
and is very comfortable

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,650
the last feature I want to highlight his

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,410
hands

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,150
Oh some AR and VR systems and the

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,250
capability of tracking your hands

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,290
instead of using controllers

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,200
this is a really naturalistic a way to

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:39,010
engage with virtual objects you can poke

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,440
stuff or pick it up or inch to grab it

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,950
it's a really nice way to interact with

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,680
a scene and really makes you feel as if

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:51,690
you're part of it

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,690
- overtime very much looking forward to

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,340
if you want to find out more please

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,340
check out these resources

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,990
I maintain a website called immersive

00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:07,330
web depth where I try and keep up to

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,870
date information about useful tools and

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,909
techniques some articles and some

00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,870
instructions on how to get started with

00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,870
different systems

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,320
if you want to see what's being worked

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,039
on right now in the immersive web

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,360
working group check out I get hub

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,940
everything we do was done in the open

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,320
you can read our old minutes you

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,330
couldn't look at the standards as

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,890
they're being written account the PRS

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,830
and if you want

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:40,679
see what's coming and some of some of

00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:43,019
the more features which are on our radar

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,940
check out our charter in which we

00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:48,499
outline someone's stuff which we intend

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,499
to look at over the next couple of years

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,820
and finally if your company is a w3c

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,730
member and you want to get involved in

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,430
building some of these standards ask

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,600
your AC rap about participating in the

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,600
immersive web working

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,860
thank you so much for listening

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,990
I've been a DeRose cannon and I really

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,210
hope you have fun making immersive

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,210
