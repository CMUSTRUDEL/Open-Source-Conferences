everyone I am a telco Lina and today I'm

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,910
going to talk to you about community

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,690
frameworks because yes in the JavaScript

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,400
community we really like frameworks and

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:18,270
maybe a little bit of my personal

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,760
history but probably not you don't care

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,180
but I think that I can I have a story to

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,789
tell

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,340
anyway if you have some time please

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,670
follow me on Twitter it's you know I

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,340
tweet about open source things and

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:35,309
JavaScript so yeah maybe you would find

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,100
it interesting so let's let's jump into

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,640
it

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,610
long time ago I was I wanted to be an

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,100
open source developer and you know it

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,559
was and I tried very hard and I built

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:59,120
things with Ruby with CoffeeScript with

00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:02,789
nodejs JavaScript I you know I was I

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,460
tried very much and I tried very much to

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,229
become an open source developer I really

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,100
wanted I really really wanted to do it

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:15,060
and yeah I don't know I don't know I

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,040
didn't go he didn't go really well you

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,700
know it's one of the key things that I

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,270
wanted to do was to build open source to

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,820
other developers build build amazing

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,070
things and yeah this was one of the

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,159
greatest stuff that you know I wanted to

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,979
I really felt I wanted I wanted to do

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,759
this and I wanted 12 publish other

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,799
developers building software and

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,000
probably don't feel as mihrab miserable

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,270
as I felt when I started and scrum I

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,820
don't know something like that a little

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:59,310
bit of the success came when I Mosca in

00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,200
13 at that point in time I was I was

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,060
doing my I was doing my PhD and

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,459
[Music]

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,869
essentially it's as part of my PhD I was

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,410
researching things on the Internet of

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:16,020
Things and I needed a very flexible and

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,480
DT broker MQTT is you know fantastic

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,210
project checkout note read as well so

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,780
hey we are part of the same kind of

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:30,930
family and when when I was developing

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:34,530
this this broker you know I I made few

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,220
mistakes the first one was it was a

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,910
completely unmaintainable really

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,740
maintainable architecture internally I

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,100
made some mistakes I didn't know how to

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,330
structure a large and successful nodejs

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,600
application back then it's also I never

00:02:51,330 --> 00:03:00,660
spent enough time in in automation and

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:02,160
in making sure CI was stable this was

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,810
actually really problematic especially

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,580
if you're building a distributed system

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,020
working in distributed systems and this

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,510
is really really critical I didn't spend

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,620
any effort in building a community of

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,620
maintainer

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:23,910
I wanted to retain ownership of the

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:29,190
project and however it it really gotten

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:31,860
some nice traction and it's and with it

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,990
there was I don't know maybe I can I

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,270
thought well you know even though I did

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,030
this as part of my GED maybe I can make

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,660
some money out of it you know I can help

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,680
me it can help me grow my career however

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:50,790
I had no real funds I didn't want to

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,540
raise much was not much of venture

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,040
capitalists in Italy back then not that

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,760
there is much now what a little bit

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,090
things a little bit better and the

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,580
project essentially failed it was a

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:09,930
galactic failure for for a few reason

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,470
well the main reason was that you know I

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,470
built a master and this monster was as

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,180
too many dependencies really too many it

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,340
was doing too many things it was not

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,090
modular it was night with that no

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,370
community and I thought it was it was a

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,240
mirror I was a Nero and I could

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,729
development in the software and make it

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,000
great which turns out the case that's

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:42,150
not our open source that's not our open

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,370
source work and you know that's it so

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:51,460
what can we say I also add a few

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:53,350
different things in in this one is some

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,190
company which I'm not going to name on

00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:00,699
this talk took my software paired it

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:03,850
with some other software and of some

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,949
really really good developer living in

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,889
London and some other software from

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:13,630
another great developer living in the US

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:17,199
and they cook it map together they

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,729
change names reach the color so it moved

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,490
from being from colored we got another

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:27,910
color and they packaged it up and sold

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,580
it to very very large company for tens

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,669
of millions and none of the three people

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,010
that I mentioned actually made any money

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:38,919
about this yeah

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,690
these didn't really go well for my four

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,700
mice for for myself really in fact

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,750
whenever this niche was developing and

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:53,740
when it was creating to develop some of

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,210
the some of you know the project was

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,860
growing a little bit and it had a

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,320
community he started to have at the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,610
beginning of a community maybe people

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,770
you know started complaining and they

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,930
started saying well I'm going to stop

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,660
using this your library because you're

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,610
not fixing this bug this was actually

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,320
really really bad and it was like it

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,930
felt really bad I don't know I felt bad

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,960
I was like I was completely and utterly

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:25,120
destroyed by by that by that sentence

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,300
which is very strange right why well you

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,280
know why nobody is appreciating what I'm

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,760
doing why they're not they're not you

00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,830
know I try to help the community I try

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,410
to help people why I'm not you know

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:42,890
being successful at all well

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,190
and then I started following in in in a

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,790
bed trap which is mostly called the

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,740
impostor syndrome you know in in many

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,290
challenges we can be personal

00:06:51,740 --> 00:07:00,110
professional professional we are l beg

00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:04,280
by the cripton thought that people like

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,250
us could not be successful and you know

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,210
it's i thought you know other people can

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:14,630
do it because they are special or great

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:22,220
and essentially better than me because

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:25,100
of whatever and you know this kind of

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,640
what happened and in fact the reality is

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,490
that you know any of that that's not

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,080
there's not such a thing you can know

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,050
something you can have something to say

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,970
in the world even if and that's probably

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,680
not what other people have something to

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,420
say in the world so there's no there's

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,860
no such thing as impostor syndrome so

00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,480
well the such thing as impersonal

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,610
syndrome but you know you're not an

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,960
impostor

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,850
believe me yourself and in fact you know

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,330
the key thought that resonated well with

00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,550
me was and I started asking myself the

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,280
question if we I was just building

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,100
software for myself and these was you

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,190
know who am I doing this software for

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,110
well I'm not you know it is I want to

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,120
improve the experience for other people

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,690
others I want others to enjoy my

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,270
software so it's it's really really

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,300
tricky and it comes for love with a

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,680
large a responsibility to be honest

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,610
because there's a lot of other things

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,800
that you know are required for

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,080
open-source to be successful you need a

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,700
product strategy you need documentation

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,380
you need to have a developer experience

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,849
on the product before developers that

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,430
are contributing to the project itself

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,090
you need to have a delivery strategy you

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:47,330
need to have long-term support semantic

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,330
versioning a lot of things people really

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,950
like one dot or dot oh by the way and

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,680
two dot order

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,510
you need to have licensing you need to

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,700
have reliable towing tooling including

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,470
CI you need to have you know some form

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,350
of outreach and promoting the project

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,070
and you need to provide some support for

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:12,149
your user

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:14,519
so yeah the problem is that there was no

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,339
chance there's no chances that you can

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,029
do all of that lo ok I don't want to be

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,160
delusional but it's essentially too much

00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:28,050
work if somebody want to do it

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:36,170
only and I say only on their on their

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:44,699
own so and with no money and yeah well

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:48,839
you know apparently I was a fool and you

00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:51,089
know there was zero chances I don't know

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,899
what to say but that's there that's

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:57,089
reality

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:59,040
so one of the things that that you want

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,920
to do is you might want to think well

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,910
I'm I just I can just do a start-up I

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:12,420
want to do a startup to convert to to

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:19,980
make sure that the mic my project is

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:22,980
safe and by creating an economical a

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,060
company behind it I can make sure that

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:30,060
it's safe and successful well you know

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,980
having a successful stop is art doing an

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,170
successful open source project is art I

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,870
think a successful startup around open

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,699
source is even harder and remember that

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,089
any cloud provider can compete with you

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:45,300
tomorrow and that's actually a very very

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,440
very very very big problem so because

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:54,449
they have a limited resource of the

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:55,889
sensor so well the question that you

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:58,319
want to ask is that if there is another

00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,959
way is there another way where you can

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:05,300
target when you can be successful and

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,310
create something well you know

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,020
there is and an open-source project is

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,470
as good as its crew as it is its

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:16,670
community which is really really really

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:18,320
really critical so the only thing you

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,850
need to if you are if you care about

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
your open-source project and if you want

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,590
to build an open-source project you only

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,150
need to care about your community who is

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,490
your community what are you talking to

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,210
that's what you should care about and

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,490
where you should talk so well let's see

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,420
let's try again let's tell another story

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:42,440
and let's see what can do we can do

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,080
differently now okay so back in 2013 at

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,510
this exact same time when I was

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,610
developing

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,070
Mosca I also built another product

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,540
another library called level graph I

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,130
don't know you probably don't remember

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,590
this you shouldn't

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,020
okay the type of research should have

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,150
been done in for developing this thing

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,420
ended up spreaded all around the world

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:09,500
for other interesting things so I don't

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,860
care but what happened is that this is

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,400
level graph was a nice graph database

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,860
built on top of level up which is a

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,530
wrapper for level 2b by the way level up

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,320
is phenomenal you should check it out

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,630
okay and this is all of this is

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,310
developed in the level community which

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,650
is a community first and then a

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,570
collection of modules seconds for

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:37,310
creating transparent databases

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:39,710
note that in November 20 22 which is

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,280
sounds a really long time ago at this

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:47,600
point

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:50,990
rod rod wag wrote about open open source

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,850
and and he stated that individual making

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,520
significant and valuable contributions

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,300
are giving the committee access to the

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,400
projects to contribute as they see fit

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,260
this is critical this is how you grow

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,910
community this is how you open it up and

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,600
you enable others to join the project in

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,870
fact it's the data is put in the seed

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,300
for open governance and the nodes is way

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,380
in fact in

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,490
in node.js our collaborator is

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,990
responsible as commit access to node.js

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:31,339
note and it's they maintain they

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:33,529
collectively maintained nodejs however

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:38,420
every collaborator can nominate somebody

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:40,640
else so a nominee and the nominees

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,500
should have significant and valuable

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,080
contributions across the node.js

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,790
organization those are two excerpt from

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,700
the node governance the node governance

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,790
is such a big file so you should you

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,370
might want to you might want to check it

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,370
out and and read a little bit more but

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,740
it's actually very an interesting read

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,970
and it's also really really fascinating

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:08,720
so let's keep going and see where we are

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,209
now if I am going to be asked to receive

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,190
this question now after seeing all of

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:20,779
this and after knowing where at what a

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,180
good community of users is when somebody

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,720
tells me that they are going to stop

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,500
using my library because they're not I'm

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,270
not fixing a bug well there is only one

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:38,899
answer to them and it's thanked here

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:41,329
please stop it's really really better if

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,540
you do something else and the reason is

00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,370
is that they don't you don't want to be

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,680
filled to felt pressures in knocking

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,870
them and they don't want to be part of a

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,680
community they just want to freebie this

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,390
is one freebie really and well everybody

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,800
likes free beer but there is no such

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,709
thing as free beer to some extent

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,540
somebody is paying for it so you don't

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:06,680
want you really really need to do this

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,820
and they're not really useful so by the

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,560
way don't be that person

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:15,740
okay really don't be that person let me

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,260
let me let me repeat this don't be the

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:23,120
person that asked for a fix on a library

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,449
without being willing to contribute any

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,140
time into fixing that work yourself it

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:30,950
might be that you need to contribute

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:33,180
very well

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,870
rapport script to reproduce the problem

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,770
or you know spend time to actually fix

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,460
it by yourself

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:45,870
but you need to help okay be a very good

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:51,510
citizen of open source so let's keep

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:54,570
going and and you know it even though I

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,120
got involved in several successful open

00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,330
source projects it's still sticking to

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,580
my hand into my mind on how can I build

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,150
a successful and launch a successful of

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,650
a sort of open source project myself

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,870
first of all you need I want that you

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,250
need to scratch your own inch you need

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,260
to be able you need you know you need to

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,420
build something that you have I use some

00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,790
unique perspective and you want to need

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:21,330
to be something to say on that specific

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,710
field the second bit is that you want to

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,420
be able to attract people that are

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,120
interesting in solving the same problem

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:32,130
and then build something together

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,730
showing ownership and you know it's it's

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,910
all about community folks so you know

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,910
that's it

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:50,010
sorry folks you know so let's keep going

00:16:42,960 --> 00:17:00,420
and talk about my experience so you know

00:16:50,010 --> 00:17:06,300
in in in 2016 I was 2016 I was I was in

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:10,709
London and it was some Valentine's Day I

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,819
was on a business trip my fiance was not

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,730
really happy about it

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,860
to be honest but you know it was it was

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,679
a business trip and I was I had dinner

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,640
with my colleagues and after that we

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,410
spent the night coding our finger - hi

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,870
Dave hey miss you

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:35,070
so in fact and and I found my niche ok

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:37,770
and I call it the adapter problem now

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,590
this is a piece of paper right and with

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,850
a piece of paper you know you can you

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,850
know you can only fold

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,970
piece of papers so many times okay I

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,250
don't know I keep folding my piece of

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,080
paper but you know there is only

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,960
unlimited tons of time where I can fold

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,980
it because after a while I cannot fold

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,820
it anymore you see it's too hard and the

00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:08,090
problem with this it's that you can only

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,880
have so many abstractions before your

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,159
code becomes extremely slow and I got

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,529
focused I focused myself and I focused

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:20,450
my career on improving performance of

00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:22,429
nodejs and ojs applications so one of

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:28,340
the first thing that I built is Pino

00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:31,669
which is a really nice lager and Wow

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,010
it's you know it took the I presented it

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,850
at a nice conference in San Francisco

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:40,730
then a bunch of other events somebody

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,429
dedicated a poem to me and a which is

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:47,090
their the author of Pinot Thank You

00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:53,630
Emily it was a greatest moment and of

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:56,510
know Julia's roar and in fact in the key

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,409
moment where things change was when I

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:03,260
started to ask you know a stranger would

00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:06,260
you like to help maintaining Pino this

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,750
was one of the greatest moments because

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,500
they said yes and first of all I met a

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,840
friend which was you know something that

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,480
probably a life hopefully a lifelong

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,039
friend but you know we have been

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,980
chatting and working together for the

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:30,740
last few years and he you know he has

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,870
been thanks to Pino and thanks to seems

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,899
to be no even thanks to working in open

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:40,309
source he was able to change jobs chain

00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:44,590
job change life he infinitely subtly

00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:49,399
significantly so hey but it was kind of

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,330
a big surprise and I have seen it

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,940
firsthand

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,529
ow open acting people acting open source

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,200
and building a community and being part

00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,010
of a community can help somebody career

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,740
and can

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,950
somebody's life so this is one of the

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:11,179
greatest thing that I think I am proud

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:13,250
of so you know Pinot is is now very

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,710
successful is the fastest long before

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,210
not Jes and it has very minimal features

00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,630
so don't expect much but it has a great

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,820
community and it's right now downloaded

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,500
maybe 4 million times per month which is

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,450
you know pretty successful to some

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,730
extent from my point of view it has four

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,350
active collaborators and it has now

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,490
reached version 6 Hey

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:38,000
successful library and so next I started

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,100
asking myself a nice question is how can

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,140
I build a new web framework for nauseas

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,900
well why do I want to given web

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:52,850
framework because I was not really happy

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,799
about the performance of of node.js

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,010
applications and I was doing some

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,220
benchmarking and a lot of consulting and

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:04,429
turns out that there was some lot of

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,770
time spent in no J in inside the node.js

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,990
framework and inside node modules and

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,110
inside libraries there and I wanted to

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,900
fix that because most of the time the

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,790
CPU time should be spent in running a

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,980
business code is run in Europe the

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,230
developers application the framework

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:26,960
should not be in the way to gather

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:30,350
together good performance so this time I

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,160
didn't want to be a fool and in fact I

00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:38,090
didn't want to I knew I couldn't do that

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,720
all alone I actually I've learned my

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,610
lesson so I started I want I really

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,610
needed to build a community because this

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,220
was it's AG again - and work like

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,290
shipping a new web framework is

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,600
gargantuan and I really wanted to build

00:21:51,290 --> 00:22:01,520
and I really wanted to build a community

00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:05,030
so the first thing that I started is I I

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,540
didn't want to start developing the

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:11,809
framework up until I could find another

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:15,139
human being that

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,820
have been interested in the journey in

00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:20,149
sharing the journey with me and building

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:24,559
with me together now this has been one

00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:26,590
of the funding moment of for me because

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,619
I was saying I basically said well did

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:34,279
they open source the code matters so

00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:37,999
little in what I wanted to build that

00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:41,919
I'm going to focusing on convincing

00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:47,570
somebody else right about that time I

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:50,330
ended up I was doing that a no Jes

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,719
worship are not training in Italy and

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,570
one of the attendees of my class asked

00:22:53,719 --> 00:23:01,460
hey Matteo I would like to get started

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:03,559
in open source and I didn't said well

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,339
where do I start where they want to what

00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:10,639
want to do and then how can I do it and

00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:13,570
then I said well I don't know I'm

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:16,849
working I would like to start working on

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,769
new on a new web flavourful no joy yes

00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:22,669
to solve all these problems that I'm

00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:25,759
seeing on the right on the others and he

00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:27,849
said Oh interesting and then we started

00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,619
working together and we started

00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:33,889
developing software together and we were

00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:38,499
chatting every every few days we started

00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:42,320
tinkering we spent long nights maybe

00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:44,749
doing stuff and well or remotely by the

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,809
way all on github and pushing things

00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:51,349
whenever we could I yelped and him find

00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:57,979
is next to jobs so again I'm feeling

00:23:51,349 --> 00:24:02,539
very very proud and yeah so it went it

00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:04,820
went really really well so anyway let's

00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:10,580
go and start about the genesis of a

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:15,589
framework and it's it's really that's

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:18,169
what led to fast if I and fast if I is

00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:21,710
the framework with myself and Thomas

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:25,790
dellavedova built together and what we

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,610
have started first of all is based on

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:32,030
governance in fact it was from the start

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:36,020
it was never to be my own thingy okay

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:41,270
he's a sure thing it's not my project

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,920
it's our project I I probably had the

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,260
idea and some of the founding moments

00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,540
but it's not mine I'm not the first

00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,930
contributor of the project okay to be

00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,830
clear

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:53,900
Thomas's I am NOT and it's community

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,850
first we welcome first-time contributors

00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,920
in fact we want to grow our community of

00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,210
collaborators so if you want to join and

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,530
want to contribute to a nice open-source

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,280
project please can we have a lot of

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,110
things to do really a lot of open issues

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,340
it's also based on the concept of shared

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:12,860
ownership so if we don't want to be in a

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,040
position of you asking us for a fee for

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,190
for fixing a bug we want you to fix your

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,730
own bugs okay and that's how we grow our

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,680
community so that this is everybody's

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,560
frameworks so everybody needs to

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,870
contribute it's also based on some few

00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,850
very important technical details so

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,090
first of all we didn't want to have much

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,730
overhead in production now you can have

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,600
you need to have some because it's clear

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,400
it's not rust

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,490
okay well it has to do it over at

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,550
abstractions but you can do pretty good

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:49,130
things with nodejs so you can actually

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,290
have very little over we want to have a

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:55,190
good developer experience we wanted to

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,920
work both for small and big projects so

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:02,270
you know individual developers as well

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,370
as big companies and which you should

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,440
work well for both and so it can be

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,710
something that I can learn on my own and

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,920
then use it at work whenever I get the

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,960
chance and you should be able to easy to

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,510
be great to micro services or serverless

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,700
and back so we needed to support both

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,640
monoliths and monoliths and micro

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,950
services and be able to use both when we

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,340
get to both models very quickly without

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,200
needed to divide the food code base etc

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,020
in here to have a good security model

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,390
and I have a good security security

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,000
reporting security reporting and by the

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,500
way thanks open Ji sangs nodejs prefer

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,920
for providing this

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,480
it it's based on the concept of plugins

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,030
so if something could be a plug-in it

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,720
likely should so we created an open core

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,690
system where it's highly extensible even

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,770
though it's you know cost free those

00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:00,020
mechanism are cost free and it's highly

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,490
extensible you can plug-in and not

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,050
things in several places of the

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,940
framework and customize it the way you

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:08,300
want so that you can develop your own

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,190
plugins and tune it to be the what you

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,580
need on your project it's also easily

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,380
testable and so code bitten we pacifies

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,610
easily testable it has a nice dot inject

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:24,920
function which is fantastic and and then

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:28,760
it's we didn't want to do any monkey

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:31,130
patching of core of node.js core that is

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,990
one of both of my main critics for a lot

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,170
of frameworks so no monkey patching

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:38,780
sorry you need support semantic

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,850
versioning and long-term support

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:46,730
strategy and it should you know are

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:50,000
there two HTTP 1.1 so first if I was

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,620
then born and it's right now one of the

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,070
fasted web framework for nodejs

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,800
it's it has ten active contributor

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,680
collaborators and it has you know now

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:05,440
reach version trees no it's in belize

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,440
canada staged as a time of this talk and

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,830
it has now an ecosystem of 140 plugins

00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,890
and it's actually very easy and fun to

00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:23,180
use so please you know check it out I

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:28,120
just want to say a few parting words

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:31,730
which is people use software I built and

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,100
there are means some and impart on some

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:38,230
great communities know JSP know fast if

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,820
I and you know in 20 20 modules that I

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,610
maintained will be downloaded around

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:49,330
five billion times which is a little bit

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:52,850
staggering to be honest and with this I

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:57,410
want to say thank you

00:28:52,850 --> 00:29:01,160
thank you for your time and please check
