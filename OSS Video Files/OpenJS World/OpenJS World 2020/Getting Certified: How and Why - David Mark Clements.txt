a daiva are you doing

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:13,469
welcome talk about today I'm going to

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:16,580
interview you right yeah let me first

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:20,070
introduce a little bit myself I'm Luca

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:24,230
Italian chief architect tell us digital

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,539
and Dave tell us a little bit about you

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:32,189
I'm Dave I do a bunch of different

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,250
things author of no cookbook the

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,010
certifications do consultancy different

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,780
things like that and as you know you and

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,390
I have worked together on various

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,390
projects at various times doing various

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,090
things our lives they were walking on

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,710
the same path for some time but I think

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,050
it would be interesting to talk about a

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,510
certification right we have been both

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,480
involved we are both strong believers

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,280
and maybe tell us a little bit the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,070
history around the certification where

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:11,070
he started and walk us through it yeah

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:13,860
so in 2016 was we were in Austin a bunch

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,250
of people from different parts of the

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,310
industry got together the Linux

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,409
Foundation sort of orchestrated that put

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,350
us in a room with a psychometrician we

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,350
gave a couple of days to do it and we

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,329
came up with the the themes the topics

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,030
the domains and the and the sort of

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,350
tasks we would expect someone who is you

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,409
know proficient with node an

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,979
intermediate to upper intermediate level

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,799
to to be able to do from there it was a

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,909
fairly a fairly long road stopping and

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,590
starting in different things but

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,840
eventually we we ended up in a place

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:55,259
where we were able to release - no Jess

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,790
certifications Oh certification that's

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,369
kind of interesting right

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,799
maybe yeah you can tell us something

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,390
about the two certifications and how

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,570
they did furs and what kind of target

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,129
audience we are well the story behind is

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,840
interesting because we already set out

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,040
to do one but by the end of it we had a

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,409
five hour exam

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,750
which we felt was too long especially

00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:25,500
since the exam is actually taken

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:28,110
remotely using a desktop VM so what we

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,069
did was we we we had to tear down some

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,819
like pear down some of the questions and

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:39,450
it was still too long and so we decided

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,599
to split it up into two discrete pieces

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,349
one that focused on servers services and

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,870
security and the other that focused on

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,519
general overall competence that would

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,569
that would translate pretty much to any

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,549
any kind of know des users usage so that

00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,370
the first one is called the node

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,930
services developer and the second one is

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,030
called the node application developer

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,010
ideally you want to be able to be

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,700
qualified with both to show all

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,310
all-round proficiency but one one is for

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,780
your your general competence the other

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,989
one is for specifically validating your

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,569
ability to build services which is often

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,459
often a thing that you need to do in

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,629
startups and enterprises alike really

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:30,540
and if you if you think about the

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,709
process right so you are the

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,310
certification tries to target a kind of

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:42,780
broad spectrum right of developers so if

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,699
you were to kind of suggest something

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,980
for a more junior audience or a more

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,780
kind of intermittent senior audience how

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,840
do you see the progression of these two

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,410
exams kind of following to these two

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,370
blockers yeah so it kind of depends on

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,190
context as always but you know if you if

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,319
you're if you're at a junior level and

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,730
wanting to reach an alpha intermediate

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,680
level or if you're an intermediate level

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,190
and wanting to validate that you're you

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,650
know on your way to senior in both cases

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,090
the general case would be to say go for

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,340
the application developer certification

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,409
first because that should your basis in

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,079
your foundation and then do the services

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:24,780
developer really just to prove that

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,990
those skills can

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,770
can sort of aggregate into a specific a

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,650
specific thing to do which build

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:39,360
services and also to show that you have

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:44,130
a good grasp of you know service site

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,130
security things like that so the other

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:53,610
scenario might be that if you're under

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:55,590
pressure to to transition career or

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,930
whatever it is then you might want to

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,669
take the services one first to show that

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,039
that on a practical level you have those

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:05,490
practical skills and then kind of fill

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,020
in essentially the application developer

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,020
is about filling in any knowledge gaps

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,729
in your notes yes sort of programming

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,620
abilities yeah and that's a very

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:19,979
interesting you know context because if

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,560
you look at usually our in enterprise

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,870
you know developers are classified

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,210
between quotes or they are identified

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,039
within the organization it's very

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,310
interesting how the certifications tries

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,990
to unify this common knowledge and

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,699
common understanding of different kind

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:41,759
of capabilities and you know I mentioned

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,909
earlier on that part of your career has

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,039
been spent in being author and a writer

00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,219
and so it's kind of interesting to maybe

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:55,710
get your perspective on what people can

00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:58,020
can consume as some sort of material to

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,820
get ready and get prepared and get on

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,520
board and into this certification mean

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,380
what will be your main recommendation

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,389
right for people that would love to

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:12,680
start this journey of getting certified

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:17,580
yeah really amazing question so there's

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:21,630
several layers to this the first one is

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,360
you can go to the open GS website and

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:27,840
there's there's a thing called the tips

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,570
document and in there there's resources

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,870
which include saying like the note yes

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,080
documentation note cookbook the third

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,150
edition

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,879
and I got a couple of other books that

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,370
listed as well I forget what they are

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,879
and that that's part of it

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,159
that you could do for something more

00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:52,150
official and structured the Linux

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:54,879
Foundation our offer certification

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:59,129
training which is like it on a self-help

00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,560
self learning platform which is for the

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,750
currently for the node application

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,639
developer certification the services

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:11,250
developer certification is still in the

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,990
works because I'm still working on it so

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,800
that should be out fairly soon as well

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:20,500
within about a month and a half I'd say

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,169
and those those are for your sort of

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,719
structured learning for if you if you're

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:29,310
just looking to do it for yourself for

00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:33,689
larger organizations that are looking to

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:37,330
like use an initiative of training I am

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:40,389
working on putting together workshops

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,210
that can be delivered remotely because

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:46,360
of where we are so any organizations

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:49,289
that are looking to invest in in in

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:54,729
skilling up people and verifying their

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:58,120
their skill levels with no DES you know

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,529
I guess talk to me on Twitter we're at

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,870
the beginning of the road with this but

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,839
we're looking at doing something very

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,789
interesting in terms of remote training

00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:13,599
delivery and in terms of the

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:17,020
certification moving forward the current

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,020
global situation right and now where we

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,569
are especially how the tech industry is

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,639
also adapting and so the the all

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,490
learning platforms that are acting to

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,930
this new moment in time and I would love

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,589
actually to get a little bit of your

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:35,849
maybe in that perspective on where do

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:39,279
you see these different channels to

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,949
train people or you know to get either

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,529
self trained or to be trained by you

00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:46,720
know yourself or you know different

00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,340
channels of training where do you do you

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,720
see this

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,940
especially if you could start to

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,580
contextualise on broader scopes like

00:08:51,940 --> 00:09:01,870
enterprise yeah so this is this is a you

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:05,620
know a huge area right now as well

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,100
because there there's travel

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,220
capabilities to start there but there's

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,940
something about in-person training that

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,710
watching videos doesn't really meet

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,520
because there's a lot there's a lot that

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,120
goes on when you're doing physical

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,190
training when I say physical training I

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,810
mean physical on-site training not no

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,300
not gym training because you you the

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,490
trainer the trainer reads the room and

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,529
they can see who's struggling they can

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,360
see who's getting ahead they can pair

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,710
people together there's all sorts of

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,620
things that can happen when you're there

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,080
not only that in the breaks on the lunch

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,470
you'll often have people with specific

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,560
problems that are on the projects that

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:57,580
they're working on that that don't

00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,940
necessarily that somehow tie in with

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,080
what you're talking about but they you

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,970
know you can have contextualized

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,410
conversations with them so there's all

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,470
these value-adds that aren't really

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,320
thought about but you definitely feel a

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:15,040
missing if you try to do just an online

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,990
workshop like just all video for

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,640
instance then you've got you know what

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,330
what are the options like if you're not

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,830
doing physical training well you could

00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,350
do the self-help thing you could do the

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,080
self learning on a platform that's

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,800
that's that works for a certain type of

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,540
person someone who who gets along like

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,209
myself personally I would probably do

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,120
well with the self the self help model

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,500
but not everyone does and also it kind

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,350
of depends where you are in your

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,770
development in terms of your skills and

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,920
everything as to whether you can you you

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,470
you can actually do that you you might

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,410
need some help to accelerate or filling

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,300
knowledge gaps that that self help can't

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,140
really can't really cater to everything

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,290
for everyone

00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:11,350
whereas a an experienced trainer can do

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:13,470
that and so you know as you know you

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,630
know Luke I've been thinking a lot about

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:21,220
how would we do how could we deliver

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:25,589
training and get as many of the be on

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:29,500
site benefits as we had before plus

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,790
benefits of of doing it online for

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,660
instance being able to retain the

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,579
recordings you know putting all of that

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,970
together into a package that can be

00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:42,660
delivered and I think you know that that

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,600
in itself is a very valuable proposition

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,070
and we are working on a model before

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,450
that and we are working on a model for

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:56,560
that for enterprise and to see how that

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,820
can be that can sort of you you know

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:09,339
accelerate the capabilities of

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:12,640
enterprise teams everyone watching this

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:16,510
you know fireside chat or has because

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,699
our usual chitchat is is the value

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,540
proposition that the certification is

00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:25,079
bringing back to the enterprise right so

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,510
there is a lot of value not only from a

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,430
knowledge and kind of know-how and

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,260
validation standpoint but especially

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,660
like you just touch them the social

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,250
aspect of this transformation right so

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,260
the fact that you know we we are kind of

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,779
the whole kind of model that is now

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,820
remote will enable actually

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,320
organizations to also transform the way

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,640
they think and I think you know the

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,100
certification is a great channel for

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:58,060
this transformation right how do you see

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,430
a key piece I think and and like you

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,959
know you know we need a we need an

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:08,170
optimization to validate you know the

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:10,829
individual people's skills that that's

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:15,190
fair as well that doesn't that doesn't

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:16,960
rely on you know heuristics like

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,660
the fact for instance that that I have a

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,380
British action British accent and I'm

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,070
white

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,080
it gives me an advantage that shouldn't

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,140
really be an advantage we should be

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,540
measuring based on whether people have

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,660
those skills or don't and whether they

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,480
can attain those skills or not and so

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,140
you know in terms of enterprise

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,960
efficiency and hiring methodologies and

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,720
all of that kind of stuff or all of this

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,690
ties in but definitely it's very

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,010
interesting on the on the enterprise

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,840
side in this current scenario and I know

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,650
you know you you yourself working

00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:03,100
fatalis you you if I can turn the

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:08,050
question on the interviewer you yourself

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:11,530
have seen I expect significant

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:17,380
adaptations as a result of this do you

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:19,300
see do you see a future where we we stay

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,980
adapted or do you see a future where

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,980
eventually it all returns back I

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,890
transfer Meishan right now happening

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,890
especially in that all kind of social

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,630
interaction and people kind of I don't

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,650
want to call it evaluation but how to

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,210
correctly measure against the

00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,970
requirements that the organization has

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:49,710
right so if you think what I really love

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:52,600
about the certification and I think is

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:57,430
accelerating on one side is the fact

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,770
that there is no every single candidate

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,440
at the moment of the end of the exam are

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:05,290
all equal there is no distinction right

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,420
it's just a challenge between you and

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,480
yourself and that's what I really like

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:13,270
about this certification it's just that

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,940
it comes across in a very democratic way

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,870
in a very equal way and on the other

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:22,960
side it brings back extreme value to

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:25,390
enterprises because I think the content

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,050
like you were describing is very aligned

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,600
with where major organisations are going

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,550
but and the other thing is that

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,649
different organizations make different

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,259
decisions in terms of technologies that

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,939
they use and even if an organization is

00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:42,629
using node they don't necessarily use

00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:46,019
the same framework so we also focused on

00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:48,959
the importance of having an exam for the

00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:53,839
certification that's agnostic to these

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,649
criteria so oftentimes you know you

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,939
certifications can have a bad reputation

00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,860
for being too subject specific what we

00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:05,369
do is we focus on the problem solving

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,779
aspects not on on specific patterns or

00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:09,839
specific frameworks or specific

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:12,899
libraries or just use a new code core or

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,610
just using libraries it's it's more it's

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,350
more about here's a problem can you

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,389
solve it which is what it should be

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,860
about and it's what again I think

00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:23,429
enterprise would be looking for a

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,100
percent under percent and that's I think

00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:29,730
the greatest value of the of both

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,279
certifications right and I would love

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,619
actually to continue a little bit on

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:39,199
this enterprise trend because I think

00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:42,869
it's pretty interesting and you kind of

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,759
touched a little bit on the the scope of

00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:47,699
the certification or your own on the two

00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,619
different programs you would actually be

00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:53,779
very interesting to get your perspective

00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:56,639
on how you see the day-to-day work in

00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:04,139
enterprise on large-scale organization

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:07,620
be impacted on one side and be kind of

00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:13,949
the driver for many developers to you

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:16,649
know take the certification exam so

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,539
sorry say the question again oh yeah I

00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:21,380
meant I would love to get your

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,250
perspective on on one side how the

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,459
organization can be positively

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,139
positively impacted by people taking the

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,870
certification on the other side I would

00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:32,610
love to get your point of view on how

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,429
you think that actually the normal

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,090
day-to-day of enterprise that you know

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:42,010
you know or we have been together you

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,830
know consulting for

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,840
they their alkane they're kind of

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:53,920
training on the job can can help them

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,180
being so getting right right so the

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,000
benefits of the organization and the

00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,970
benefits of the individual correct so

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,120
for the organization as we've discussed

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:09,790
I think we have that capacity to measure

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:14,020
I think that that becomes an important

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:19,300
thing in terms of in terms of management

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,840
layers within an organization so if if

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,640
we if we put training into that as well

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,030
when I when I go and do training for

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:33,310
something that's not certified which I

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:36,580
often do there's not necessarily an

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,500
absolute measure on that the the measure

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,240
of whether the training was a success is

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,100
based on the feedback and the feedback

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,830
is based on a you know a relative

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,140
feeling that enough of the candidates

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,330
feel that they've been stretched and

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,280
they feel that it's valuable and that is

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,160
that is good day's a good measure to a

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,590
certain extent but it's not an absolute

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,430
measure it's not it's not something that

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:05,850
you could really tap to a KPI but if you

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:10,990
have training that's attached to a

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:13,420
examination that has a pass rate and you

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:18,760
are able to with training within the

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:23,620
organization exceeds that pass rate then

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,800
you know that you're developing people

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:30,850
within your organization a level that is

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:36,010
above market conditions so I think that

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:40,110
that is very powerful dynamic for for

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:46,290
growing talented teams in organizations

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:50,760
in terms of for the individual you know

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:55,660
removing the the fact that you you have

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:58,929
an accreditation that is support

00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:02,460
and verified by the open J's Foundation

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,460
and the Linux Foundation

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:10,210
you will also be skilling yourself up

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,260
even if you feel that you're at a

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,660
certain level what we found is a lot of

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,820
people come to doing these exams and

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,650
actually tell us helped us with with the

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:25,750
alpha testing and this feedback we got

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:29,710
where where people well did not realize

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:33,250
how many knowledge gaps they had because

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,330
in your everyday job you don't

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,169
necessarily come across this knowledge

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,390
gaps however once you've a legit still

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,490
makes your day job easier because you

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,250
you find easier routes to doing things

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,659
because you've covered more surface area

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:54,730
in terms of the problem domain right so

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:58,059
we there's benefits all around and I

00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:03,669
think something like this has a really

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:08,440
compelling selling point to both people

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:12,090
and organizations it's we've also got a

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,750
lot of good feedback from alpha beta

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:19,000
testimonials different things like that

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,770
saying essentially that this was one of

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,450
the best exams they have taken can

00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,740
versus others which is excellent and a

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,500
lot of the testimonials come back saying

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:37,510
I like how it focuses on real-world

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:42,309
problems not not just puzzles so I think

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:44,080
that putting all together you have

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:47,610
something that can essentially elevate

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,610
both the individual and the organization

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:58,740
to be more successful with with node

00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:58,740
yeah I've exhausted that question I feel

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:08,129
when we tell us digital agreed

00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:10,999
on you know contributing to this

00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:15,389
fantastic initiative we immediately saw

00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:18,029
value in investing into that right and

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:21,359
like you said is a way not really to

00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:24,389
measure with a negative connotation our

00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,029
developers but is a way to help them

00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:30,690
finding a path of growth and a part of

00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,960
improvement especially because like I

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,700
said I compared the certification to

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,149
like you know playing golf when you play

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:42,210
against yourself right it's like this is

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:45,090
a competition once again is a healthy

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:50,039
competition and I think to add to your

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:52,769
previous point about the the physical

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:56,279
training right there is there is some

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:58,799
sort of element in the whole process

00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,779
that resembles our you know people go

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,289
into the gym or people trying to train

00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:07,320
and improve you know their capabilities

00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:09,210
and I think that's the beauty of this

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,729
process right is that is a continuous

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:17,549
iteration and that's why it's pretty

00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:22,590
variable I I would love to ask you a

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:26,989
little bit not really your point of view

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:29,879
but almost your point of view on

00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:31,710
workshop and I said I said it in this

00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,640
way because as you said it's part of

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,980
what you are trying to formulate and

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,320
something you're working on so I was

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,789
more wondering if you could kind of

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,120
elaborate a little bit more on how you

00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:47,899
see workshops and interactions now you

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:51,260
you've what in your honest opinion is

00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:53,360
the best way for everyone to kind of

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,190
bring that kind of experience within

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,750
their organizations or their working

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:04,130
groups or their communities yeah okay so

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:07,580
I mean you've got the self-help in terms

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:10,250
of a interactive experience that's that

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,929
could be one more way this does that

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,779
some people that have an affinity with

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,700
that approach in an organization they

00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:19,700
could they could use that approach then

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,529
you've got services like udemy which is

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,600
you know pre-recorded stuff and that's

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:31,100
fine too but it's it's actually just

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,309
another form of self learning right what

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:39,710
I'm thinking of is guided learning where

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:44,090
you combine essentially videos and

00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:47,539
exercises and trainer presence all into

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,929
one one package that's delivered to an

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:54,289
organization to you know 20 people at a

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:57,169
time in an organization so that everyone

00:24:54,289 --> 00:25:00,409
gets personal attention it's more of a

00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:02,720
masterclass than training if that makes

00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:06,710
sense it's more like a mentoring and

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,190
coaching using using training materials

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:12,710
and using a sort of a workshop approach

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,480
where with exercises and so forth but

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:19,309
that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,720
just leave you on your own in the dark

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:26,419
to kind of battle battle through it so

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,350
that's the kind of that's the kind of

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:32,539
formula that we're playing with

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:35,059
currently and you know hopefully we'll

00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,070
have will have more moving forward but I

00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:40,149
mean the material is there the material

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,679
is ready to go it's more a case of

00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:46,700
finding something and I think we're very

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,200
close finding something that that is

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,529
suitable

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,529
for for enterprise organizations and

00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,940
even public offerings as well there are

00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,230
there are different timelines that you

00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,789
could deliver this one you could do it

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,690
all in a week you'd do it over three

00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:06,619
months but it just depends on on you

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,570
know both the the organization once that

00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,850
training and the actual the actual

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,129
trainer which would be myself and

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,429
possibly others that we'd get involved

00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:21,200
to do it that also similar sort of

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:22,909
industry industry experts but whether we

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,989
go forward on that it kind of depends a

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,919
lot on on a couple of different factors

00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:29,659
whether there's interest whether the

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,119
model works all of that kind of stuff

00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:33,590
however I think I am very excited about

00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:36,859
it I think that it could be something

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,320
that could really help push forward the

00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:42,789
whole digital transformation that a lot

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,009
of large organizations have been

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,739
essentially forced to go into so I think

00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:53,509
that that's a wave that's worth going

00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:55,580
along for the ride with yeah and we

00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:58,519
spoke a lot about enterprise and big

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,389
organizations right so let's maybe take

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:05,690
the last couple of minutes of this yeah

00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:07,549
very beautiful chat with you to talk

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,960
about communities right so because

00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:12,950
clearly know it's a very popular

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,409
framework and technology that are

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,080
growing massively across communities and

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:21,350
enterprise but if on one side we saw the

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,470
benefits of the certification for the

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:28,340
enterprise ecosystem how do you see the

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,350
certification impacting the the other

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,159
side of the matter that is the more kind

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:38,480
of open community driven absolutely

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:42,259
origin of node so we've we've also seen

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,499
global interest in the certification and

00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:47,779
from a community side we have people

00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:51,019
that contribute to node who live all

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,470
over the world not just node but also

00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:59,599
the ecosystem

00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:03,259
this makes pricing a tricky issue these

00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:06,799
certifications themselves are $300 each

00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:09,169
but one of the ways in which to sort of

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,929
access or allow access for the global

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,909
community is that the foundation of

00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:16,700
doing regular promotions and there's a

00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:18,049
lot going on right now with scholarships

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,710
as well I think there was actually a

00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:26,870
post recently by the executive director

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:29,389
an update on that so in terms of growing

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,700
growing individuals in the community who

00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:37,370
just are just go getters and they just

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:40,220
want to get certified themselves in

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,720
terms of the actual benefits that

00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:46,419
something like this would bring to say

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:51,320
the open-source community the more

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:54,980
skilled people that we have and the more

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,919
we can validate those skills the better

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:03,889
an open-source project our over source

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:08,750
project will do so if anything we want

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:12,679
to be able to help people move into this

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,179
industry because there's always the tech

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,720
industry in general is always hungry for

00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:20,360
more talent and as a byproduct of that I

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,580
would expect to see some more emphasis

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,379
engagement as well

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:28,929
lovely so how can people contribute to

00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:33,559
that because that's probably the last

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:34,970
missing piece of our conversation can

00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,789
people complete we are to the

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,769
certification is there is a way for them

00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,769
to be more engaged and be contributors

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:50,830
so big for privacy for for purposes of

00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:55,370
having an exam that it is difficult to

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:59,179
to cheat on the involvement in

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:02,750
certification is is not open right

00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:06,610
because otherwise you could just go look

00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:10,639
up the answers and that's the the the it

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:12,250
has been a community initiative for a

00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:15,860
while

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:20,630
at a certain point it's switch to event

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:22,850
during arrangement instead so in order

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,440
to preserve that privacy there's not

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,450
really a way you can contribute to

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,059
certification and other than taking it

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,679
and then and then report back giving

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,270
feedback testimonials or different

00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:40,190
things like that however what you can

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:44,000
contribute to is the scaling up of other

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:45,790
people for the certification and if

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,100
you're interested in doing that

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,570
definitely come contact me so if you

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,980
want to if you want to talk if anyone

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,260
wants to talk about any of this other

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,809
stuff we've been talking about you can

00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:01,100
hit me on twitter is at David Mark Klem

00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:02,780
I think I'm gonna be there typing away

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,530
anyway when this is this videos going

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,350
out so I'll type it at that point and if

00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:12,890
you're interested in certifications go

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:22,370
on the open jess website and you'll see

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:23,990
you'll find it from there so the other

00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,280
thing was the Linux Foundation website

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,070
if you if you want to look up the

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,900
self-help training for note application

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,320
developer again I'll put it in the link

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,330
sorry Dave I really thank you for this

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,770
beautiful chat i hope everyone listening

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,500
to this talk will find enough

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:43,090
information for them to you know join

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:48,040
this trend and try to get certified and

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:51,840
i want to say thank you again and

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:54,190
child--a ciao
