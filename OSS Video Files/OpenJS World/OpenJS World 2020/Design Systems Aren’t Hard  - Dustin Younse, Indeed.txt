welcome to the talk my name is Dustin

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,170
yachts

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:11,190
this is Design Systems aren't hard but

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,630
they are complex and also hard on the

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,480
internet I'm known as Mills Yap Taff

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,480
which is a name I picked in 1998 and

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,010
just never got around to changing I've

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,070
been working on large website since

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,570
roughly 2008 been working with design

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,840
systems since we used to call them

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,130
swatches or even just style tiles I

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,260
currently work in design engineering and

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,640
indeed which is a job that I think comes

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,290
with probably the greatest laptop

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,629
sticker around so you might be asking

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,800
yourself what exactly is a design system

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,020
I first saw this graphic from Nate

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,739
Baldwin and a talk at artifact

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,360
conference fall of 2019 it really drove

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,969
home just how many different definitions

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,520
there are to the term design system just

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,969
how complicated it can be each of those

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,219
circles is an artifact and the team made

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,180
that artifact whether it's you know the

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,820
UI kit the component library the

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,799
documentation a lot of people don't

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,740
think about content strategy that's part

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,140
of a design system but it definitely is

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,960
and if you kind of squint your eyes and

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,759
look at this just right kind of starts

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,330
to resemble I don't know like an org

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:29,850
chart Conway's law states organizations

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,619
which design systems are constrained to

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,390
produce designs which are copies of the

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,420
communication structures of these

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,220
organizations it's kind of a long winded

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,110
way of saying that products tend to

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,340
resemble the communication of the teams

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,979
that build those products

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,350
Uncle Dave Rupert has his own law your

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,360
website is a manifestation of your

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,280
organization's problems products tend to

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,509
reflect the communication problems of

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,950
the team's building that product if you

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,509
take a look at this graphic one more

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,399
time we can see that each of these

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,099
artifacts is coming from a different

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,310
team either communicating or not

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,390
communicating with other teams something

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,010
like documentation

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,780
maybe it's owned by a

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,049
team or maybe it's owned by technical

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,049
writers the UI presentation layer could

00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,090
be owned by a UX department while the

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,540
actual UI kit and the visual design

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,430
language is owned by maybe a brand team

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,340
or a marketing team teams that you know

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,760
don't necessarily work together on a day

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,810
to day basis and that doesn't really you

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,310
know clear things up when you're trying

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,989
to think about what a design system is

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,840
so let's think about it from a different

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:48,569
angle what isn't a design system a figma

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,430
library that's not a design system you

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,560
know figma library or a UI kit built

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,940
with some other tool it could have all

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,180
of your components in it could have all

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,780
of your colors all of your buttons and

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,190
show people how your your menus look

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,650
yeah this is going to represent maybe

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,200
one team's idea of the design system

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,569
really well but it may not be perfectly

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,030
suited to another team you know

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,849
developers they like figments a lot

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,519
nicer than using some other software at

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,750
times for a developer to get in and get

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,680
the data that they need to make the

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,299
product that they need but it doesn't

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
tell them you know it often doesn't tell

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,299
them things like how things look when

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,079
they animate or what they look like when

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,430
a page transitions so okay maybe a fake

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,930
in the library that's not a design

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,780
system what else a react component

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,340
library this is the kind of thing the

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,250
developers always want when they're

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,440
talking about design system they want

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,060
something that lets them do the least

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,150
amount of work when it comes to building

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,470
new product new interface a react

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,840
component library is a great way to

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,819
share code easily helps you build

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,310
functional prototypes or even entire

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,190
products really quickly with a minimum

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,709
of custom code but this still isn't a

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,150
design system it doesn't always say it

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,190
doesn't always reflect the flow of a

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,319
customer through the product very well

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,780
it'll show you know what a button looks

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,579
like or what a form looks like but it

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,349
can't actually show you what it looks

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:22,860
like to go from beginning to end for a

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:25,770
customer so what else an external

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,389
website promoting your design system you

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,590
know I think we all loved to check out

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,660
the

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,889
latest design systems are being released

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,760
by some of the big companies out there

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,290
the you know the Google's the git hubs

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,500
all kinds of really great things to look

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,790
at things to learn from lightnings been

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,880
doing really great work with web

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,570
components Polaris is amazing for

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,400
theming but these are actually not

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,400
designed systems either these these are

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,740
just kind of a snapshot frozen in time

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,100
of the system that that company is

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,930
actually using internally a lot of times

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,500
these public versions that they release

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,370
they can lag by months or even years

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,200
behind what is actually being used

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:15,139
inside of the company these are all the

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:20,690
artifacts these are not the system so

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:22,669
what is a design system at the root it's

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,880
an agreement on how digital products are

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:28,550
made that's all it's an agreement within

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,270
your team or your department or your

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:36,050
company on what your products are what

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,320
they look like and how they work what

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,460
kind of agreements are we talking about

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,479
we're talking about user interface

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,639
design how the digital experience looks

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,539
interaction design how it feels you know

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,910
when you're actually clicking around

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,750
you're going through and using the

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,610
software content strategy again this

00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,280
isn't always super obvious but this is a

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,990
huge part of a design system we need to

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,270
know how our digital experience should

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,500
sound to the customer when they're when

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,580
they're reading our interface and near

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,460
and dear to my heart

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,410
documentation we need to know how this

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,289
digital experience is crafted whether

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,330
we're designers or developers whether

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,010
we're in marketing it doesn't matter we

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,979
need to know the decisions that have

00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:26,830
been made and why they've been made

00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:29,870
that's documentation design systems

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,490
unfortunately they take time they take

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,900
time because it takes time to reach an

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,430
agreement on big things on small things

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,320
you might be surprised to learn just how

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,010
long it can take to agree about

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,470
something as simple as

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,060
button you know just your standard

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,370
primary button can be weeks or months of

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,830
back-and-forth in negotiation

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,930
maybe you're testing your ideas and your

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,920
assumptions in your life product using

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,840
a/b testing this is going to take time

00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,290
here are the primary buttons from by

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,490
five different design systems they're

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,240
all very similar they're all buttons

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,790
they all have text you can click them

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,290
and they do a thing but they don't have

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,240
very distinct differences whether it's

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:20,520
color or shape shadow sometimes a design

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,390
system will have put icons on a button

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,020
sometimes it won't

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,460
on the Internet the button is one of

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,070
your primary interaction points with a

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,510
customer and that means that a lot of

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,120
people have a lot of opinions about

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,460
inside of your company and it's going to

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,500
be a large source of frustration when

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,950
you start building a design system so

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,720
you need to be prepared for that so we

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,970
know they take time but you know time is

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,370
money and that means that design systems

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,560
take money

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:55,440
you can't shortchange this you should

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,690
take the time to do it right so why

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,880
bother I mean this seems like it seems

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,830
like an awful lot we've got out you know

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,410
we've got to think about oh we have the

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,380
you know agree on buttons we have to

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,980
agree on typography we have to agree on

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,920
the tools that we're gonna use so what

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,260
are we getting out of this and the

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,820
answer to borrow a business word is

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,380
scale design systems are all about it

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,550
you're gonna get interface design at

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:31,860
scale interaction building at scale

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:33,690
content creation at scale when everyone

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,720
on your team knows how a thing should be

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,490
built they can just go build it they

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,750
don't have to stop and think they don't

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,970
have to ask questions they just know in

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,360
my current job I'm working on design

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,940
systems and we do a lot of support more

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,700
support than you might think and the

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,129
absolute number one question we get how

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,009
do I do X

00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:01,290
how do I use a primary button how do I

00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,610
use a secondary button in relation to a

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:10,920
primary button how do I invoke a modal

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:12,240
and the number two question why this is

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,250
you know as important if not more

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,399
important than the first one

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,800
to give people the ability to do things

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,860
on their own they need to know not only

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,870
what they should do but they also need

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,259
to know why they should do it so that

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,120
the next time they encounter a problem

00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:32,069
they can apply that rationale and come

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:38,189
up with their own answer and not have to

00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:40,769
come to you I believe that a design

00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:43,110
system is a service not a product and

00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,740
this it can be difficult inside of

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,639
companies to convince people of this

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,819
they want to treat it like a product

00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,519
they want to do roadmaps as if it was a

00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:57,540
product but at the end of the day it's

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,029
not it's a service it is providing

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,399
answers it is deciding on new answers to

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:05,040
new questions it's you know helping

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,189
people integrate the design system with

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,100
a new product or an existing product you

00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:14,069
know legacy code bases that power large

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,529
chunks of corporate websites are very

00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:20,670
hard to get design systems working

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:23,160
sometimes and that is the job you know

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,899
treating it like a service you know

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,759
having support channels having dedicated

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,949
people in those support channels people

00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,170
who aren't writing code that day all

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:36,060
they're doing is there to ask questions

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:43,769
answer questions because really you need

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:46,709
to answer questions not read code coming

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:51,029
back to this picture you know again

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:52,829
there's a lot of artifacts here what do

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,470
you think is the most important one what

00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:58,079
would you guess I think if you come from

00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,790
a design background you're gonna kind of

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,829
tend towards the ones that are kind of

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,860
reddish pink the UI presentation layer

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,209
or the components or the UI kit if

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,769
you're a product person you're gonna be

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,310
very drawn to the purple you're gonna

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,330
want to talk

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,890
a lot about processes if you come from a

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,930
brand background where you're thinking

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,360
about like that the holistic look and

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,950
feel of a company content strategy is

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,800
gonna stick out as well as the visual

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,860
design language if you're a UI person

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,270
yeah maybe a little bit of everything

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,660
and if you're a developer I mean dev

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:34,620
standards that's a big on so which one's

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:38,100
the biggest the most important if you

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:41,880
only have the time or the money to do

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,990
one thing and do it well what should it

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,510
be I would say documentation

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:52,710
I think documentation is the single most

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,029
important piece of the puzzle a design

00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,300
system we've already talked about is

00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,700
made up of agreements you need to write

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,580
those agreements down you can't just say

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,870
oh well you know two months ago in a

00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,450
meeting on Tuesday somebody said this so

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,400
let's do that

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,710
you need to have it written down where

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,360
everybody can see it and review it and

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:19,680
understand it and edit it as they need

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,820
that is the most important thing you can

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,940
do if you have the budget I don't

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,920
strongly recommend you hire a service

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,530
designer this may not be a job pal

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,890
you've heard of before I hadn't before I

00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,780
started my current job a service

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,900
designer is there to think about people

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,780
and think about infrastructure you can

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,120
think of them as the personification of

00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,390
documentation and customer support they

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,550
may often come from a UI background or

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:54,120
development background but they are

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,910
there to think from you're a busy about

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,220
the customer they can help drive

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,560
adoption of new design systems if you

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,150
know you have a deadline you need to

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,190
have a design system rolled out by a

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,940
certain date they are absolutely

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,870
invaluable

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,900
they are the extroverts to the to the

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,140
development and design introverts they

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,540
will make the relationships they will

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,940
you know find the data convince the

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:27,150
stakeholders that need to be convinced

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:29,700
they are fantastic and finally your

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,490
documentation should change as often as

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,120
necessary shouldn't think of it as set

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,490
in stone you know we're not rating

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,900
things in spiral notebooks but you

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,820
should think about what kind of software

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,930
that you use when you're writing down

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,360
your documentation it should be

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,090
something that's easy to edit quick to

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,610
edit that everybody has access to I

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,460
would recommend not using a git

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:56,040
repository I think that's a common

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,870
pitfall for teams you know developers

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,630
they love git repositories they love

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,190
markdown but that's not the friendliest

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,110
for designers or product designers love

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,690
things like figma they love to write

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:13,950
things down in there that's not the

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,540
friendliest for a developer so think you

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,150
know think about something kind of

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,220
abstracted something agnostic I've seen

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,910
people use things like notion really

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,740
well you can you know obviously use

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,110
something like Google Docs it's got a

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,280
lot of great tools one of the nice

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,860
things about something like Google Docs

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,200
is it lets you know who changed

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:41,400
something and when it changed which can

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:44,430
be super important down the road at the

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,710
end of the day design systems can be

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,950
used to help everyone that's a great

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,720
thing when I say everyone I don't just

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,610
mean designers and developers but

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,940
specifically the users users that aren't

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,480
always thought about design systems give

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,390
you accessibility at scale they give you

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,270
a system that you can be reasonably

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:15,560
assured a button is gonna work as a

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:17,760
button links are gonna work as links

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,950
animations are going to automatically

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,900
respect the prefers reduced motion

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:27,080
directive without having to think about

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,390
it without having the right extra code

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,760
somebody can simply pull in an animated

00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,800
component and know that it's going to

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,769
work

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,429
in an accessible manner it also gives

00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:42,230
you inclusion at scale you can be sure

00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,869
that when you pull in a form field it's

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,989
going to accept accented characters it's

00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:49,939
going to accept various types of Unicode

00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:52,189
like somebody wants to put an emoji in a

00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:53,959
field it'll probably work if you've made

00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:57,410
one form field work that way

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,119
they should all work that way things

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,369
like right-to-left text presentation

00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:03,410
it's just going to work this is an

00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:04,989
incredibly difficult thing to do on just

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,459
about every product I've ever worked on

00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:09,739
but once you do it once and you do it

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,720
right it's really easy to use that

00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:15,679
across all of the different places where

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,829
you're displaying text in our in our

00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,779
products that indeed we actually have we

00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,540
are global company we have lots of job

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,999
postings that are mixed languages and

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,209
this is a very complicated thing to fix

00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:31,309
but once you fix it once it's it's fixed

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:33,589
if somebody wants to write a job title

00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:37,220
in Japanese in a job description in

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:41,389
English easy somebody wants to write a

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:45,889
job title in German and a job

00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:50,329
description in Arabic it's done that's

00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:52,490
great so always think about how you can

00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:54,589
take those hard problems that need to be

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,759
solved and figure out a way to solve

00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,850
them once for everybody

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:05,959
drive that that scale of inclusion let's

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:08,659
scale of accessibility so if you learn

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,689
nothing else from this talk learn this

00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:14,990
if you do nothing else write

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:19,959
documentation if you can do nothing else

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,959
plus one thing hire a service designer

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:29,120
Design Systems are hard and that's the

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:31,520
work and that's okay there's you know in

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,169
our industry it's it's really it's

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,690
really tempting to try and make things

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:39,770
easy for ourselves as designers and as

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,860
developers at the expense of ease-of-use

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:46,370
for an end user and we need to avoid

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,660
that trap we need to do the hard work we

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,670
need to find

00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,790
the unified methods of working for our

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,610
teams so that you can reap the rewards

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,290
long-term superior experience is not

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:02,960
just for your developers and your

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:04,550
designers but also your end users just

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,920
want to drop some resource links here at

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,860
the end some of the places where I found

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,280
some of the information on this

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,870
hopefully you've learned something

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,370
hopefully you can take something back

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:19,420
and make your team a little bit better

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,420
