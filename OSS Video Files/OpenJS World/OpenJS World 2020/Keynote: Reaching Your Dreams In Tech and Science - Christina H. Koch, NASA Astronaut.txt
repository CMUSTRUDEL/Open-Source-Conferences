welcome back to open joyous world we're

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,980
celebrating 25 years of JavaScript with

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,320
a lineup of more amazing speakers I'm

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,660
Robin Ginn the executive director of the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,150
open J's foundation coming to you from

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,070
my home in Washington State and today I

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,039
have the honor of introducing our first

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,340
keynote speaker NASA astronaut christina

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,470
cook so who dreamt of being an astronaut

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,680
when they grew up and wondered is there

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,080
still time you know when I was a kid we

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,809
built and launched model rockets in our

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,670
science class in school and today we're

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,730
learning about how software is powering

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,070
space missions but you know last year

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,920
for me watching the all woman spacewalk

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,829
was just like the significant moment in

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,809
science and technology and NASA

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,449
astronaut Christina Cooke was on that

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,550
spacewalk she also holds the record for

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,750
the longest single space flight by a

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,149
woman with 328 days in space

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,280
Christina graduated from North Carolina

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,350
State University with a Bachelor of

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,450
Science and electrical engineering and

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,619
physics and a Master of Science and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,159
electrical engineering

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,010
please welcome nasa astronaut christina

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,259
cook hello everyone and thank you so

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,909
much Robin it is really my distinct

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,369
pleasure to be with you today on open

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,380
jeaious world I used to be a coder in

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,750
former lives and had to kind of leave

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,930
that behind to get more operational so

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,180
it is just wonderful to be with you guys

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,729
even in my research for this talk I was

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,040
lucky enough to end up getting my own

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,600
account on github so I'm getting there

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm hoping to use it a little bit to

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,759
share some of the apps I've been writing

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,280
for my nieces and nephews so today I

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,350
really can't wait to share with you guys

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,180
a little bit more about my side of the

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,220
things and how we use the things that

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,439
you guys do to explore space which of

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,960
course we completely do depend on the

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,430
work that you all do my talk is gonna be

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,930
kind of in three parts first of all a

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,090
little bit just about where we are right

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,490
now in human spaceflight kind of story

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,020
time about my my experience my journey

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,360
and my mission and then just a couple

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,940
thoughts and insights like I said about

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,830
how our worlds are interdependent so

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,410
with with nothing further let's get

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,820
started and first of all where we are

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,980
so this is the International Space

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,320
Station where I live for about 11 months

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,650
working on board and as you know it is

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,240
an orbiting laboratory that we use for

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,190
microgravity research things that we

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,560
can't do here on the ground and that's

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,590
to bring benefits back to earth and also

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,390
to test technologies and operational

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,080
concepts for how we can actually explore

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,940
deeper and in longer space missions

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,130
astronauts to and from the space station

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,260
in a couple of ways right now for the

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,350
last several years after the shuttle was

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,420
decommissioned in 2011 we had gotten on

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,430
board via the Russian rocket called the

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,260
Soyuz and that is picture of up here

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,780
that's how they look when they're docked

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,550
to the space station but as of May of

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,340
this year we actually have a new ride to

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,960
space and it is the SpaceX crewed dragon

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,060
vehicle so we're bringing in commercial

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,210
partners to achieve that role of getting

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,010
astronauts to and from the space station

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,420
we've been using commercial partners for

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,310
getting cargo to and from the space

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,050
station for years and these are two

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,870
pictures of some of those companies this

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,990
is a SpaceX cargo dragon flying docked

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,360
to space station above the now and here

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,910
is the Northup grumman Cygnus cargo

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,500
vehicle and all this you know new

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,930
reliance and looking into fostering a

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,200
space economy has really been so that

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,520
NASA itself can focus our internal

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,380
objectives even further and deeper into

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,060
space we are now working on the Artemis

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,610
mission which is going to go back to the

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,170
moon with people in this decade and then

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,209
hopefully take those technologies and

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,640
apply it to a future Mars mission so

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,600
it's a really exciting time to be

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
exactly where I am right now and

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,080
involved in the human spaceflight

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,459
mission speaking of that shifting gears

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,970
talking a little bit about my journey

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,680
and how sort of started out as a early

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,560
electrical engineering physics lab

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,970
person and working on space science

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,250
instrumentation so this is working on

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,320
those space science gadgets that fly on

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,600
planetary probes and earth orbiting

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,610
satellites that study the things that we

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,530
send those missions into space to do and

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,900
obviously that invite involved a lot of

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,700
custom software to test our equipment

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,580
and to develop it along the way

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,740
but after getting this job at NASA right

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,690
out of college I actually quit that

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,160
perfectly good NASA engineering job to

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,030
pursue another dream that I have which

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,070
was working in the

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,620
anok and i call this the first that i

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,330
got to do of science on the frontiers so

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,550
I did a lot of different sessions that

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,130
eventually moved me to working both in

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,230
the Arctic and Antarctic and it was from

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,120
a place about 500 miles north of the

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,980
Arctic Circle that I actually submitted

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,770
my application to become an astronaut

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,740
and much to my surprise about a year

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,090
later I found myself here among the

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,060
class of 2013

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,680
astronauts and the one notable thing

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,210
about our class that I'm really proud of

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,850
is we were the first and so far the only

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,919
class to be Half Men and half women and

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,169
I think that sort of embodies a lot of

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,540
my experience so far in human

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,820
spaceflight now for the first two years

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,200
after being selected you're in candidate

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,810
training and that means you get to learn

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,120
a lot of new things so my engineering

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,040
brain had to learn how to sort of

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,840
operate at supersonic speeds we had to

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,390
learn how to fly high-performance Jets

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,610
think fast off really important problems

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,380
really quickly I had to learn how to do

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,810
spacewalk training which as you know is

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,450
something that's both a really huge

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,680
mental and physical challenge there were

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,390
other things we have to learn all about

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,090
the engineering systems onboard the

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,100
space station as well as how to operate

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,290
the robotic arm and eventually a few

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,060
years later I found myself assigned to

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,100
an actual mission aboard the space

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,419
station and then we moved into a phase

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,220
of our training that was more mission

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,750
specific so I finally got to learn about

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,200
the science that I would actually be

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,080
doing on my mission and I got to learn

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,360
the Soyuz rocket now take a look here at

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,060
our user interface and I want you to

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,680
kind of remember that picture because

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,870
from here we're going to talk about kind

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,970
of where we're going in the future I got

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,950
to train a lot in Russia so one of the

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,270
great things about the International

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,700
Space Station is that international

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,550
aspect and pretty soon I found myself

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:19,140
launching from Kazakhstan on a Soyuz

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,030
rocket the space probe spacecraft bakes

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,620
away from the rocket and it begins its

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,330
autonomous flight and then eventually

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,520
approaches the space station in this

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,940
very docking mechanism you see here

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,800
forms the hatch that we open up when we

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,440
float into the space station for the

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,960
first time not long after we're put

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,080
right to work that work includes doing

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,599
maintenance and up

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,939
grades on the space station systems it

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,580
includes operating the robotic arm to

00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:51,430
capture from autonomous flight some of

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,870
these visiting cargo vehicles and of

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,340
course that includes science and that

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,169
science the science that can only be

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,550
done in microgravity and I since I'm

00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,889
talking to programmers I just have to

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,750
say one of the things I love about this

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,150
is when I was doing a lot of programming

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,560
of physics modeling programming I would

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,300
you know we're always confounded by

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,129
these boundary conditions and having the

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,810
code for sort of the edges of what we're

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,389
of the theoretical things that we're

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,090
trying to explore well to me

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,590
removing gravity as a variable is one of

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,569
the great things about Space Flight we

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,509
no longer have to worry about you know

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:24,069
the kind of nuances of whether the fluid

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,840
we're studying is on the bottom where

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,099
gravity is you know causing it to

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,080
interact differently with the walls of

00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,240
the vessel versus the top and that kind

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,500
of gives us that edge in industrial

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,569
settings but we're really trying to

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,639
probe these absolute fundamentals of

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:38,199
different physical processes in this

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,969
picture however I'm taking advantage of

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,879
a different aspect of microgravity which

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:45,039
is growing protein crystals which helps

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,909
us to develop pharmaceuticals so there's

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
a lot of different ways that

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:52,360
microgravity can lead us to really cool

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,190
discoveries in this picture it's another

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,860
example of technological advances and

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,960
tech demos this is an older version of

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,029
an autonomous flying robot that we have

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,250
on the space station and a newer version

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,680
this older version actually relied on

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,050
separate sensor systems and ultrasound

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,569
to have it know its location and

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,550
orientation in space whereas this robot

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:15,250
actually has the computational power to

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,219
map the module that it's in and rely on

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:21,849
video processing to understand its

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:23,050
location and orientation and then of

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,729
course our work onboard the space

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,659
station will be complete we didn't talk

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,460
about spacewalks

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,159
this is Jessica and I'm preparing our

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,079
suits prior to our spacewalk that we had

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,699
the honor of doing which was the first

00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:37,690
time his face book had been done by two

00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:39,370
women outside the space station and this

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,440
is what we look like out there on a day

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,849
at work and we work of course with

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,100
ground teams that are walking us through

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,010
every moment of our seven hour spacewalk

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,800
out there so it's a really exciting way

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,270
to contribute and to keep the space

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,010
station

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,330
optimally as I mentioned two before the

00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,740
International aspects of what we're

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,300
doing is in my opinion one of the

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,070
greatest legacies of the space program

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,050
and of the International Space Station

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,030
this is me working with my cosmonaut

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,700
colleague alexey ovchinin prior to one

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,990
of their spacewalks and the russians

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,910
actually have their own spacewalk

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,920
systems in airlocks and i had the honour

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,540
of suiting them up and operating their

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,660
airlock working with the russian ground

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,760
control systems to do that as as we went

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,190
we also work really closely with the

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,740
Russians on emergency procedures and

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,600
drills so it's truly a group effort we

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,780
also had astronauts just during my time

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,510
out there from Canada Japan the United

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,240
Arab Emirates and we also we also have

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,160
partners in the Europe so we I had an

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,410
Italian astronaut that I flew with as

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,420
well so it's it's a truly international

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,830
partnership and kind of developing those

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,940
relationships and ways of doing business

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,260
is just so important well it's not all

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,910
work onboard the International Space

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,310
Station of course one of the things we

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,990
love to do together is group meals and

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,880
group eating this is us opening up a

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,790
bunch of fresh fruit straight off of a

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,290
cargo vehicle and one of our favorite

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,810
things to do is actually pizza night

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,270
normally all of our food is dehydrated

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,110
and rehydrated to eat out of packets or

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,910
MREs

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,100
so anytime we can figure out a way to

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,930
make real food ourselves it's really a

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,880
treat my ultimate favorite thing to do

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,100
of course is to look out the window upon

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,110
earth and you know for this crowd I have

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,270
to say I could I could have called this

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,400
looking down on every spot that uses a

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,230
JavaScript in the world because I'm

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,030
pretty sure there's not a single spot

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,100
that I look down upon and said maybe the

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,870
middle of oceans a work JavaScript

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,780
wasn't running so it's it's truly a

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,390
global enterprise but my favorite thing

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,630
to do was to take pictures I love taking

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,090
pictures of the night sky and of course

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,800
of the earth and I know you all are a

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,710
global community but I believe you're

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,190
headquartered in San Francisco so and of

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,680
course

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,840
lots of coding happens there so this is

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,100
a picture that you know you can see the

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,400
edge of the earth and Earth's horizon

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,150
and this is the San Francisco Bay and

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,590
zooming in this is a photo I took with

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,690
800 millimeter lens

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,700
and I think you guys are right in this

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:13,140
neighborhood right around here but of

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,330
course all the things have to come to an

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,060
end and eventually it is time to head

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,470
back down to earth when we undock from

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,790
the space station the next thing that

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,740
happens is our vehicle actually

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,630
separates so the only part that returns

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,400
to earth is a tiny little crew capsule

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,780
that has all the heat shielding so that

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,250
when we hit that atmosphere and the

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,880
friction of the atmosphere can start to

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,160
slow us down

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,010
we kind of enter into what's like almost

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,600
like a flame ball and that's how we slow

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,090
down so that we can eventually go under

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,370
parachute and land on the ground so you

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,600
can see how burnt the capsule is from

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,450
that experience and that's actually

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,400
what's planned before you know it the

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,180
Russians search and rescue forces are

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:54,780
extracting you and that's basically the

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,960
end of your mission so shifting gears a

00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,600
little bit to the next part of the talk

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,220
about software so of course to get the

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,690
mission done and to do all those things

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,360
that I talked about in the space of the

00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,270
day we have a lot of custom software

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,120
that we use and it spans the realm of

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,010
both web-based and standalone so this is

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,440
this is just a screen cap I actually

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,120
happen to have and back here you can see

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,980
a web-based software that's actually our

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,990
scheduling software our days are

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,260
scheduled down to five minute increments

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,120
and this software is completely the hub

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,710
of every single thing we do it's how we

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,240
learn about the different state of the

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,130
systems onboard the space station and

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,530
any constraints things those things may

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,060
apply to our own day and we learned what

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,930
we're doing we have the procedures for

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,640
how we're gonna do it the

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,950
interdependencies of everything so it's

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,390
extremely important and then stand-alone

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,700
software this is an example of

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,860
standalone software for our treadmill

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,510
because of course exercise is really

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,250
important to keep our bones and muscles

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,780
healthy on board the space station but

00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,310
we can't just have any treadmill because

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,800
we have to actually wear our harness

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,440
that bungees us down just so that we can

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,110
be able to run and stick to the wall to

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,030
be able to get our exercise in so this

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:09,150
is a little bit this is the GUI for that

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:10,890
exercise appointment during our days we

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,600
actually run a kind of our whole lives

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,190
off of a tablet that has web-based

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,870
software that contains all those

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,180
procedures that we need to run through

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,370
our day so this is just

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,050
extremely important for what we do and

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,640
there's kind of an operational side to

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,230
it and then we also do have access to

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,440
the Internet through the tablet on a

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,120
different network so this is absolutely

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,950
the hub of what we do and enables

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,390
everything we do also I picked this

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,580
picture because it's kind of right

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,370
around our server farm here and we have

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,350
all these virtual servers and hypervisor

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,670
servers that are hosting all of our

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,260
operational products talking a little

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,630
bit about kind of where we are in

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,300
technology and even some of the future

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm hoping some of you all are aware

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,160
that like I mentioned earlier in May we

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,470
had a launch of a SpaceX rocket carrying

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,660
crew to the International Space Station

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,750
and one of the big stories about that

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,910
was the displays and how the astronauts

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,130
interacted with the systems onboard and

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,800
they did it through this was the first

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,660
spacecraft that had touch screens the

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,580
gloves of the spacesuit were actually

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,410
designed to allow the astronauts to use

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,200
that touch screen and to do so even in a

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,910
high vibration environment and even you

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,230
know in a different thermal different

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,240
thermal environments they may encounter

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,890
there were a couple buttons on the

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,830
bottom for critical operations like

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,810
firing pirate Pyro's if they needed to

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,640
do some of those dynamic operations and

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,830
something happened with the redundant

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,589
computer system and also some of the

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,510
parachute systems down here but by and

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,860
large everything was controlled through

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,360
the touchscreen which was truly a

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,130
breakthrough and it's one of the reasons

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,660
that NASA wanted to foster the space

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,420
economy to really bring out that

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,400
innovation that's available kind of when

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,850
you tap into people that don't have that

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,950
legacy the legacy hardware that has you

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,380
know tried and proven but may actually

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,150
be sort of linking you to technologies

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,070
that are of a different era so it's

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,270
exciting to see how they kind of started

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,360
from scratch on a lot of these

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,130
technologies now the NASA vehicle that's

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,110
being built currently is called the

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,360
Orion vehicle and that's the part that's

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,860
the crew module that's part of that

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,420
Artemis mission that I mentioned it's

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,029
going back to the moon and then on to

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,579
Mars and we also have a really neat

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,350
thing within the astronaut office where

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:26,010
we're actually developing the crew

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,570
interfaces for this vehicle within the

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,730
astronaut office and that's one way to

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,750
make sure that the test pilots and the

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,750
people that are actually going to be

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,690
flying these vehicle

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,550
has had insight early on this lab is

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,430
called the rabbit rapid prototype lab

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:42,130
and it's one of the very few development

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,930
processes within kind of a aerospace

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,940
vehicle development that it's actually

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,040
user driven where there's not a

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,750
requirements document that sort of

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,060
trickles down to forming the hardware

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,150
but we actually make the interface view

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:58,210
ease first and then sort of document it

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,250
later and and describe how they work

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,170
we don't have touch screens in Orion but

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,120
we do have the soft key abilities so you

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,250
don't see nearly as many switches as say

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,230
and the so user in the shuttle and these

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,060
are a couple examples of some of those

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,250
screens and another innovation is that

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,260
instead of having stand-alone procedures

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,520
that where you know astronauts have to

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,870
search around for buttons or the

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,790
different you know think that they're

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,590
gonna monitor the procedures are

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,900
actually built into the displays so you

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,630
run a procedure on the display and it

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,130
may say pop up a menu that shows you

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,080
where you need to be looking and then

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,790
you you know to verify a certain state

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,620
or something like that so it's

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,630
definitely becoming a more integrated

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,670
flow where we're taking some of those

00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,750
best practices from industry about user

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,610
interfaces and applying them and then

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,010
finally you know the last thing is

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,440
perspective having done this long

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,180
mission and having had the privilege of

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,150
contributing to something I've loved for

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,880
so long it really helps me to think

00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,700
about the future of exploration and I

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,339
think that for me living onboard for 11

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,410
months taught me that yes we can do

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,709
extremely long-duration missions going

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,839
deeper into space we can explore Mars it

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,120
was doable you know it took identifying

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,709
certain strategies to make sure that we

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,290
were thriving and doing our best every

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,589
single day but to me the future of space

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,540
exploration is bright and I'm looking

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:24,220
forward to seeing just how far we go in

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,350
my lifetime and with that thank you

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,000
again for your attention for taking a

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,650
little break from all of the hardcore

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,770
coding stuff you guys are talking about

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,540
and listening to one of the many ways

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,760
that the work that you do is applied

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,130
hopefully to bring back benefits to all

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,900
of humanity I would love to hear what

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,660
you are curious about and answer any

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,940
questions you have hey Kristina thanks

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,530
for joining us

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,230
thanks for taking questions from our

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,210
community absolutely my pleasure Thank

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,700
You Robin great so the first two

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,380
questions we have are somewhat related

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,500
you might have touched on it a little

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,800
bit Elly Galloway who is a young

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,290
developer in San Diego wanted to ask if

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,360
you have the Internet in space and my

00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,340
son mate who's a developer in Seattle

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,270
kind of had a related question he said

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:15,200
are you coding in space and if so can

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,690
you check Stack Overflow if you need to

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,420
those are great questions yes we can

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,310
surf the Internet in space and sometimes

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,050
it turns out to be really helpful yes we

00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,120
even will Google YouTube videos to

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,250
figure out how we can do a little like

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,080
jobs parts of our jobs up there or just

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,140
for entertainment to feel connected with

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,180
the world one interesting thing is that

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,300
we can only surf the internet on our

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,980
tablets so they do a really I guess you

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,770
know for security reasons keep our

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,330
ability to surf the world wide web

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,250
completely on a separate system from our

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,800
operational products that we use to go

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,110
throughout our day so yes for 11 months

00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,070
I surf the web only on a tablet but I

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,260
survived and you know on board the space

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,700
station we don't do a lot of coding I

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,100
would imagine that if it were a hobby

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,710
and you requested like specific app to

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,380
do some you could I did not but I

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,840
haven't so I didn't necessarily access

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,270
Stack Overflow up there but I have been

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,950
accessing a lot down here on the ground

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,050
I'm trying to teach myself how to write

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,520
apps like I mentioned earlier for my

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,830
nieces and nephews which has been a lot

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,050
of fun so I have sort of like gotten

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,230
into the Stack Overflow world that's

00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:27,210
very cool so Alexander who's an

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,820
open-source technical leader in Moscow

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,160
Russia said Wow

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,140
I know NASA is doing tons of things with

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:41,370
open-source what's the culture of

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:46,350
sharing like at NASA we put the limbs in

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,090
Minooka this time in english yes Thank

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,670
You Alexander for the question we do

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,950
share quite a bit with open-source at

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,210
NASA as you know an astronaut I

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,800
unfortunately don't get to do a lot of

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,500
the coding myself but we have all

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,030
of hacker challenges that are put out by

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,160
NASA to solve different problems that we

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,320
have within the human spaceflight and of

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,450
course all of those are can you know be

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,610
built on open source in addition I think

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,530
about things like modeling you know the

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,270
finite element modeling and using open

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,910
source programs for that like you know

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,830
the higher-level languages maybe are

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,960
things like that so it is definitely Vic

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,030
witness and I think that we all

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,010
appreciate that there's this culture of

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,690
sharing the work that we've done and the

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:31,230
means by which to do that great and we

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,390
have Deb from Phoenix Arizona who asks

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,780
how has aerospace engineering benefited

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,580
from open source technologies well again

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,980
I think that everywhere you look you

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,710
would find examples of it benefiting in

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,690
our hacker challenges you see options

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,820
all the time of people sharing open

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,040
source code and of course having those

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,380
platforms available to share versioning

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,240
and things like that are absolutely just

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,710
fundamental to doing that one example

00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,810
that comes to mind that's really

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,330
important is in the recent crew Dragon

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,490
vehicle their user interfaces actually

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,140
were built on chromium and with

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,600
JavaScript so that's just an exciting

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,520
thing that I see going forward that

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,290
we're all utilizing those platforms that

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,350
are available you know to everyone

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,620
together okay Joe sepi from New York

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:23,140
asked is node modules really the

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:25,780
heaviest object in the universe I have

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,660
to say I'm not sure but you know if you

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,280
look at how it bends space-time hey if

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,440
it's you know bending space-time more

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,890
than a black hole then you know jury's

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,300
out

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:39,730
gotta go with that he did have a serious

00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,100
question though about what kind of

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,550
security concerns are there in space

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,940
do you have cyber attacks for example

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:50,440
you know luckily our software engineers

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,390
and our IT people on the ground make

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,310
sure that the space station systems are

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,010
completely isolated and hopefully safe

00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,110
from all of that the three different

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,000
main computer systems that we have that

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,130
are isolated are the computer system

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,040
that actually physically does all the

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,020
i/o of all the you know effectors and

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,330
sensors onboard the space station

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,980
then there's the

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,570
additional pcs that we use throughout

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,910
our day like some of the software that I

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,950
showed you earlier that's also separate

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,420
from any kind of external network like I

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,490
mentioned we can't necessarily surf the

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,170
internet on that there are very specific

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,810
things that we can do that require

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,940
network resources or you know in an

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,410
interconnected world there and then we

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,240
have sort of the tablet side of things

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,530
and that's where if we're on a separate

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,690
network blah blah blah we can actually

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:36,090
sort of access the World Wide Web so I

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,250
would say we do it by separation and you

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,590
know interestingly when I got to space I

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,300
thought that I'm you know all the Wi-Fi

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,920
networks are gonna be open right because

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,660
obviously no one's you know in the

00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,060
apartment next door are gonna stay why

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,920
but no we still had passwords on all of

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,930
our Wi-Fi networks not quite sure why

00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,550
but you know maybe you can never be too

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,930
safe and you're not gonna share that

00:22:53,550 --> 00:23:00,330
that why that's very cool

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,340
you got a shout out from a fellow NC

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,250
State grad Paul Barnum who is a software

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,720
engineer in raleigh-durham area so we

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,790
want to know really how did your

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,090
university studies prepare you to be an

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,970
astronaut Wow in so many ways I would

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,980
say the most important way was kind of

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,570
in those later classes where you're

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,160
doing a lot of team work and you're

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,490
getting to solve problems in new ways

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,920
and kind of relying on a diverse team to

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,480
solve those problems I was actually one

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,450
of those more like fiercely independent

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,300
folks in school so I wish I had sort of

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,640
gravitated more towards team team sports

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,080
in solving technical problems earlier

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,690
because I was kind of late to the game

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,460
on that but you know some of the classes

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,660
I had an embedded systems development

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,670
that kind of brought all those elements

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,740
together I had little green boards I had

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,060
software I was very happy and I was

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,310
working with a team of people where we

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:53,190
all were contributing in our strengths

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,800
areas was really really cool and then

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,570
also the extracurriculars I took up rock

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,960
climbing at NC State they offered that

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,430
class as a PE class and interestingly in

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
my interview to become an astronaut I

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,340
think we talked more about rock climbing

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,190
than we did about electrical engineering

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,530
and you know I also studied abroad at NC

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,890
State I studied abroad in Ghana in West

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,000
Africa and those experience absolutely

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,560
absolutely lend themselves to me

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,020
learning how to be adaptable how to

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,470
survive in new places and how to just

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,690
kind of like bring a

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:24,490
set of tools into a new situation to

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,890
hopefully thrive and to just appreciate

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,289
other cultures as well so a lot goes

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:32,020
back to that and it's great to hear from

00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:35,470
another NC State Wolfpack err that's so

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,510
cool okay so you know you and I you and

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,840
I may share some experiences of being

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:43,240
the only woman in the room so you know

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,669
what's your advice to the many women in

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,010
tech who may find themselves the only

00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:51,340
woman in the room and really struggling

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,980
to break through definitely I think back

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,480
to my years working and learning as an

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,220
electrical engineer and I remember

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,409
situations like that all the time I

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,630
remember sitting in meetings being the

00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,700
only female voice and I felt like as

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,740
soon as I would open my mouth and talk

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,860
you know all eyes just turned because it

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:11,409
just stuck out like a sore thumb a

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,600
really funny story - one of my favorites

00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,659
about this and it really to me speaks to

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,630
how there may not be as many overt

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,460
things that are going on in our worlds

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,650
that are barriers when we find ourselves

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,120
in those situations but there are still

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,460
barriers and there are still things that

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,890
make that an uneven playing field and

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,900
one of those stories is I was in a

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,570
conference room with you know ten other

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,070
men engineers and it was we were taking

00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,530
a break from a big technical meeting we

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,270
were having and everyone filed out you

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,880
know for the bathroom break and went in

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,110
a row to the bathrooms then of course

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,520
there's a men's room in a women's room

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,110
next door to each other and I was

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,340
talking with the engineer in front of me

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,950
I'm in this kind of line of people

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,700
filtering out and what a gentleman he

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,740
held the door for me to the men's room

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,530
so you know it was just one of those

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,350
examples where it's both transparent and

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:05,559
it's tangible all at the same time and

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,210
for me one of the ways that helped me

00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:11,650
the most to get through those times was

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:14,049
to identify and then strategize so for

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,610
example when I I knew that

00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,929
knowing I was the only female voice in

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,110
the room was preventing me from speaking

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,789
up so I would actually visualize and

00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,270
what we do in it actually is astronauts

00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:28,120
is chair fly situation so I would

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,760
literally practice speaking up I would

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,500
practice or visualize the feeling that I

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,520
would have when all that attention came

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,530
on me suddenly sort

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,810
more so than if anyone else just spoke

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,940
and I would practice how that felt and

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,890
how I would work through it and so

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,870
that's one strategy another strategy for

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,370
example that was really helpful for me

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,370
it was when I learned about the concept

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,840
of stereotype threat I'm not sure but

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,760
just to explain that to anyone who may

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,330
not have heard of that stereotype threat

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,360
is kind of something that has been

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,430
proven through research that when you

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,980
are aware when you expect there to be a

00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,290
stereotype in the room it actually can

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,610
negatively affect your performance in

00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:11,830
such a way to bolster or backup that

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,720
stereotype so for example if you're a

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,190
female and you're assuming everyone in

00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,990
the room thinks you're not as good of a

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,120
coder not as good at spacewalking

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,010
something like that you're gonna have a

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,750
separate sort of thread in your mind

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:26,050
running thinking and worrying about that

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,660
that's actually gonna make you lean on

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,490
the side of fulfilling that stereotype

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,100
rather than being your best it's

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,010
actually in a pull performance away so

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,740
how I battled that was before all of my

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,780
space walk trainings and and just to go

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,700
back to that space walking in NASA is

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,350
probably one of the areas that we see

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,840
the biggest difference in terms of men

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,810
and women and the you know the diversity

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,320
situation there over 200 men have done a

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:58,390
spacewalk and only about 15 women have

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,790
ever done a spacewalk so it's the the

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,950
biggest gap that we see so going into my

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,300
spacewalk trainings um you know we're

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,400
all used to the strategy of giving

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,860
yourself a pep talk but I actually

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,660
developed this strategy of not giving

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,550
myself a pep talk and telling myself you

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,040
got this you're gonna do great I told

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,410
myself that everyone around me thought I

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,120
was awesome at space walking I would

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,620
actually envision them telling each

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,270
other that I was a really good space

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,220
Walker I would envision them saying

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:27,550
Christina is really good at this and

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:29,290
just bolstering that vision in my mind

00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,410
would actually help me bring as much

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,820
performance as I had to the situation

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,960
rather than the opposite where I was

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,280
thinking that they were up there in the

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,230
control room rolling their eyes every

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,000
time I made a mistake so you know

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,100
learning what the things are that are

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,130
out there doing some research on what

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,669
are those still the subtle but very very

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,830
tangible biases

00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:51,529
and developing your own strategies to

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:54,889
counteract them great turns out you're a

00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:56,749
pretty awesome space Walker well but

00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:58,369
tell me about that moment when you and

00:28:56,749 --> 00:29:00,139
you and Jessica were out there for the

00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:03,619
first time first all woman's spacewalk

00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:06,049
for sure I actually go ahead and show

00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:09,289
you while we're talking through that um

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:11,720
so this is a Jessica and I let me know

00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,629
if you don't see that during actually

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,239
our second spacewalk that was the second

00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:19,009
all-female spacewalk and it was an

00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:22,100
amazing feeling we were very very

00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:24,499
focused on our task at hand so we didn't

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,659
take a ton of mental energy to think

00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,369
about the fact that it was had a lot of

00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,289
eyes on it and it was the first

00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:31,879
all-female

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:34,009
the first one that we actually did was a

00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:35,450
contingency spacewalk it was done it

00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,830
wasn't planned we had never ran it on

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,720
the ground in fact I had only been

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,789
practiced on the ground one time in the

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,419
week leading up to it because it was to

00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,940
fix an unexpected repair situation so um

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:50,350
you know I would say what got us through

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,909
that was focusing on not only

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,710
participating and doing it but actually

00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:58,070
thinking of how we could do it really

00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:01,039
really well so if you focus on ok I'm

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,559
you know I'm just here to to get them to

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,539
just do it as opposed to I'm here to be

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,539
an awesome space Walker I'm here to lead

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:10,970
I'm here to to get this battery fixed as

00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:13,100
quickly efficiently and safely as

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:16,039
possible I'm not just here to go out the

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,129
door I think that that's what led us to

00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,779
kind of rise above the attention that we

00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:22,970
knew that it may be getting for being

00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:25,429
the first all female and just to execute

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,009
it like any two space walkers would that

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:29,950
said there was I said the one the one

00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:32,989
moment that we had were we kind of

00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,509
recognized how much honour we we felt

00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:37,279
that we were getting and and how special

00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:38,450
that moment was was when we first went

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,609
out of the airlock and we were both

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,200
holding onto the handrail right outside

00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:43,879
the airlock and you know the blackness

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,009
of space and we kind of caught each

00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:47,989
other's eyes and we just smiled right

00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:49,879
you know between some communications and

00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:52,940
we knew we had done it at that moment so

00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:55,549
it was a really special honor knowing

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,200
that we just were so grateful for those

00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,090
that paved the way for us to be there in

00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,870
that time and also that there was a

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,100
chance that

00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,630
we were actually providing the

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,540
inspiration that so many people have

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,160
provided for us in the past to be there

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,430
in that moment it was just incredibly

00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:15,380
special yeah definitely inspiring to me

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:17,350
and I know so many others so Wow okay we

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,290
have priyanka sharma from san francisco

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,760
also a developer wanting to know what

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,700
are some of the things you miss about

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,840
being at the international space station

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,200
particularly given how the world is

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,600
today yeah that's a good point I do kind

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,400
of feel like a lot of the isolation that

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,170
we're all experiencing is a familiar

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,640
feeling to me you know some people have

00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,940
told me okay everyday it feels like a

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,530
Tuesday and I think I can relate but you

00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,570
know the thing I miss the most is the

00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,220
camaraderie of having a crew that you're

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,110
working so closely with you know working

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,850
with only five or six other people

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,070
day-to-day to solve really tough

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,860
problems and to get through these

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,510
challenging 12-hour days was just an

00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,370
experience that as adults we don't

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,740
really get that very much you know to

00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,880
get to know people their ins and outs or

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,230
strengths and weaknesses and to

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,360
contribute to it's such a close-knit

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,640
team day in and day out is definitely

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,280
what I miss the most

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,679
great and our open Jas program committee

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,710
wanted to know what is the hardest

00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:19,640
technical issue you solved and what

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:24,190
process led to your success you know

00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,470
that is an interesting question and

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:30,260
there were so many little things that we

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,970
had to solve up there but it also goes

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,800
back to what I was mentioning about how

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,830
but in becoming an astronaut I actually

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,809
had to leave behind a lot of the really

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,600
highly technical things that I did and

00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:44,809
trade them in for learning how to work

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,280
operate and think operationally and so a

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,470
lot of the things that I would say I

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,470
contributed to herself were more about

00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:54,620
finding efficiencies in microgravity

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:58,460
rather than you know finding a bug in a

00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,100
code that I had to dig around for but on

00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,780
that point one time before I flew in

00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,010
space and I was a Capcom which is the

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,520
person that's communicating with the

00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:09,800
astronauts because of my history as

00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,380
and just someone who used command line

00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,850
stuff I was able to actually find a bug

00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,630
in one of our procedures and saved

00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,790
astronauts some time that because there

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,680
was a typo where the little dot prior to

00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,080
the file structure name was missing so

00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,360
you know wasn't gonna say to start in

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,030
the present directory so that was you

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,630
know my one moment but up there I would

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,830
say that again a lot of it was more just

00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:37,370
looking at the problem at hand and

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,200
trying to strip away the biases that I

00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,660
had coming from a gravity centric

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,060
environment so a lot of times when I was

00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,560
working with a researcher on the ground

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,120
on some equipment that was flying in

00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,550
space for the first time there were a

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,830
lot of legacy kind of one grant 1g

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,480
things that were causing was causing the

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,320
equipment to not perform optimally

00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,540
so providing ideas for solutions we had

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,520
a fiberoptic experiment for example that

00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,170
had to be tweaked a little bit because

00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,510
to better account for the lack of

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,310
convection in its heating processes and

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,780
things like that so working with the

00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,850
researchers and pointing out things they

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,429
may not have thought of for for

00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:17,810
microgravity was kind of where I saw our

00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:18,590
role as hopefully contributing great one

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,409
last question

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:25,970
so just broadly what's a good day at

00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:28,250
work for you a good day in space oh oh

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,899
it's a good day in space is a day where

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,750
you get to do a little bit of all of our

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:35,570
different tasks where you get to and and

00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,010
just was out most days actually because

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,840
in our 12-hour day we were definitely

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,550
doing a little bit of everything so a

00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,800
little bit of science a little bit of

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,470
maintenance a little bit of photography

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,240
a little bit of getting to work with a

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,399
team on doing something you know really

00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,320
high stakes maybe you were gonna study

00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,419
that day or doing onboard training for

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,210
capturing a cargo vehicle or doing a

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:58,760
spacewalk and then you know getting to

00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,280
talk to friends over the voice over IP

00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,840
phone and the end of the day that that

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,340
makes for a great day in space and I

00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,950
think the same kind of stuff makes for a

00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,480
great day here on earth great well we

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,550
really appreciate you joining us you

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,680
really made us have a great day at our

00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,320
conference and I know people enjoy

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,110
watching this for time to come so thank

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,950
you so much yeah great to have you thank

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,950
