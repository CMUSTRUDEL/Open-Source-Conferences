	Evolution of Modern JavaScript with Jordan Harband LIVE @ OpenJS World 2020

To say the way we use and write JavaScript has evolved since the launch of ES2015 is an understatement. Atomics, TypedArrays, globalThis, and function generators are just a few ways JavaScript has grown up to meet the needs of a growing web platform. But it's not just language that has evolved, it's our entire toolchain as we have come to rely on compiled JavaScript as the "new normal".  Join for a very special episode of The Web Platform podcast as we discuss all this and more with our invited expert on all things ECMA - Jordan Harband at OpenJS World 2020.
