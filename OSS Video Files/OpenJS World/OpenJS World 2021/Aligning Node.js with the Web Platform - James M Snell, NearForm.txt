Description: 
	There's always been an argument that Node.js is not a Web Browser and therefore shouldn't act like one, and while that's true in many respects, there's still significant benefit in ensuring that JavaScript that works in the browser works the same way on the server. In recent years a great deal of effort has gone into aligning Node.js with the Web Platform, including implementation of the WHATWG URL API, TextEncoder, Intl, and more. Node.js 15 has moved even closer with the addition of EventTarget, AbortController, and the Web Crypto API. This talk will introduce developers to the new Web Platform superpowers that are now built in to Node.js and pull the curtain back on ongoing efforts for what may be coming in the near future.
