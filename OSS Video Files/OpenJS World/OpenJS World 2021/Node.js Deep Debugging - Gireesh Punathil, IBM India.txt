Playlist: OpenJS World 2021
Description: 
	While there are established debugging techniques for well known problem types, we have come across rare and complex yet interesting production issues - stemming from pervasive build, deployment configurations and heterogeneous workload types that node.js is subjected to. In this session, we will illustrate case studies of few unique issues that we debugged, custom diagnostic tools that were used and lessons learned. The attendees will learn addressing deeper level production problems and self-diagnose anomalies.
