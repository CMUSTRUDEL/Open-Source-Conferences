Description: 
	TypeScript makes JavaScript safer by adding static type definitions. Static definitions are wonderful; they prevent developers from making trivial mistakes by ensuring every assignment and invocation is done correctly. A variable typed as a string cannot be assigned a number, and a function expecting three arguments cannot be called with only two. These definitions only exist at build time though; the code that is eventually executed is just JavaScript. But what about the response from an API request? In this talk by Ethan Arrowood, Software Engineer 2 @ Microsoft, he will cover various solutions for safely typing dynamic data in TypeScript applications. This talk features popular technologies such as Fastify, JSON Schema, Node.js, and more!
