Description: 
	Keynote: Open Open Source and Making Great Places for Collaboration - Joe Sepi, Open Source Engineer & Advcoate, IBM; Michael Dawson, Node.js lead for IBM and Red Hat; Beth Griggs, Senior Software Engineer, Red Hat

The Node.js project is often seen as an example for Open Source projects and we’ve learned a lot over the last 5 years about how an “Open” Open source project works. The goal is to build places where both individuals and companies can come together to make impactful technical, organizational, and community contributions. Come learn about some of the core concepts and principles behind open communities and governance and how we are applying these to help grow the OpenJS Foundation. What’s more we want your help, find out how you can get involved!

hello everyone thanks for joining us at

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,919
openjs world 2021 for our keynote

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
open open source and making great places

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,679
for collaboration

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,400
my name is joseppi i am an open source

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
engineer

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,000
at ibm primarily working in the node.js

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,920
space and at the openjs foundation

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,680
beth hi everyone my name is beth griggs

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
and i'm a senior software engineer at

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
red hat

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,080
where i spend a large portion of my time

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,199
contributing to the node.js project and

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
i'm michael dawson

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,360
i'm the node.js lead for red hat and ibm

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
that means i get to spend a lot of my

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,440
time working in the community

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
various working groups the technical

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,040
steering committee but it also means i

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
get to work with great teams within red

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,879
hat and ibm

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
and people like joe and bethany in the

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,879
work that we do

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800
for the node.js in the node.js space

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
so we're here to talk about open open

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,879
source and

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
you know i think the the reason that

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,000
we're talking to you is because we're

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,120
all have been very active in in the node

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
project

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
and you know the node.js experience is

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
where

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,240
you know we've seen that that sort of

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,159
approach really proved out and

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
you know some of the the advantages and

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
some of the challenges that that we see

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
some of the key elements are that you

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,119
know no one company has

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,960
control you see a lot of projects out

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,320
there where they're open source but

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
usually they're sort of led in the

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,439
direction of set by a particular company

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
node.js has no one company do you know

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
doing that

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
it's really a group of companies who who

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,439
come together

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,720
um and interesting so go ahead joe

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,640
yeah i was gonna say there are rules in

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
place to kind of prevent that too uh

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
which is great but

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
you know one of the things that i love

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,079
about the work that we do in in the

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
node.js space

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,680
and the way things are set up is that

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
everything is really transparent and

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
accessible

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,720
uh we try to do all of our work in

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,680
issues and pull requests

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
and um you know working groups and and

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
things

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
like that so it's the the barrier to

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
entry is uh should be

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,600
the doors are open i'll say

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,439
yeah certainly that transparency and and

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
the work that we do to make sure that

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,879
you know

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,319
anybody can come to the project and work

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,239
on that level playing field

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,239
is is sort of a key component it's it's

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,879
that if i'm invested in

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
in node and i want to depend on it um

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
you know me as an individual

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,239
and certainly organizations want to have

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
confidence that they can

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
you know get involved and move the

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
sticks forward in the areas that are

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
important to them

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
and you know that open open source

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
approach allows everybody to kind of

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,160
work on the different areas that they

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
think are important and have the whole

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,319
project move forward

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,920
much faster than you know i think uh

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,440
projects that are driven by a single

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,360
company because there's only so much

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
that one person can kind of stick into

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
their head and keep on top of and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
this sort of distributed approach really

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,800
lets us

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
us move you know forward in all sorts of

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
different ways

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
yeah i i certainly think that's probably

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
one of the most surprising things people

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
find

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
about the node.js project is that

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
because we are

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,480
open open source and everyone comes in

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
with their own ideas

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,560
we don't have a roadmap we do have

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
initiatives and ideas and

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
plans rough plans in place within the

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
working groups about what we might like

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
to do

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
but there is no we want to deliver this

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
by this date

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
and i think people do tend to find that

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,440
surprising but it is

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
an outcome of us having not one single

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
company

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
or organization driving the project yeah

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,959
and certainly what

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
seems to come out you know what comes

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,480
out in a release is what people have

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
decided is important and worked on

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
and it's sort of an amalgamation of that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
all across the way

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
and you mentioned we don't have you know

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
a defined roadmap that doesn't mean we

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
don't have

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
plans and goals and things that we think

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
are important we

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
you know the working groups and teams

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
are are bring together people who are

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
working

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,200
on areas that are of interest to them so

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
you know the people who look at the

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
you know work on on the build side of

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,159
things the people who

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,519
work on say new http clients so there's

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
lots of people who come together with

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
sort of a vision of where they think

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
they want the project to get to

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,280
but we don't necessarily have that as a

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
top-down driven

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,879
effort it's more of a bottom-up hear the

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
people coming and i think that's

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
actually one of the really

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,959
interesting things about the the sort of

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,880
open open source approach and

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,840
and what makes the note experience you

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,400
know really interesting to me anyway

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,759
uh so yeah people are very surprised um

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,919
that they can't just

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,160
turn up to the project contribute pr

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,720
start participating in issues

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
um or start joining our meetings all our

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
meetings

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
tend to be open for everyone and to join

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
you can

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,040
find the calendar and just join them and

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,560
and i think people do find that

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
surprising they need to know

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
that the project's open in that way for

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,479
anyone to turn up and join

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
um and that does come with the challenge

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,639
of making people

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
feel comfortable and and we have worked

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
hard to try and

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
lower the barrier to entry so people are

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,680
comfortable in doing that

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
yeah i know i often get that question

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,639
like well how do i join the meeting and

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,400
the answer is

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,720
there's a zoom link you can show up you

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
can participate just like everybody else

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
but sort of making sure people are

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
comfortable and then comfortable to

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,960
speak

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
up um you know is an ongoing effort

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
within the

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
the project and then similarly sort of

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
you know

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
people being comfortable that they could

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
lead a particular area so

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
you know the the project we have some

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,199
really good experience

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
in node core but it actually covers a a

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
very broad range so people can come to

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,199
the project and have some domain

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
experience which is really really useful

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
and in fact they may know more about

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
that particular area

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,639
than anybody in the project and making

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
them feel comfortable enough to to bring

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
that experience and share it

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
is you know one of the things that we

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
need to continually sort of work on and

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
remind people that they can

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
they can do that one of the things that

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
worked well within the release working

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
group which was one of the working

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,960
groups i'm particularly active in

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
is we set up some mentoring sessions

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
and so in the calendar we blocked off an

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
hour every couple of weeks

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,199
where anyone who had an interest of

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,600
joining the release working group

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,680
and maybe eventually producing helping

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
to produce the releases of node

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,080
could join and just shadow the process

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
ask questions learn about how they can

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
pick it up and pick up a release

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
and we found that worked really well i

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,880
think we onboarded around about three

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
three new releases from those sessions

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,720
and

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
it's not it's not an easy task to grasp

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
it's not something you can just like

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
read a doc and then get on with it and

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
so i think it was really valuable

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
it was really great to get new people

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
into the project and

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,400
help out yeah it seems that that

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,360
particular efforts

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,440
uh was was was success very successful

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
i've seen the the release team grow and

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,680
that's

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,240
really fantastic um and the mentorship

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
uh program overall in in the node.js

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
space has

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
has uh had other successes as well i

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,479
know

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
michael uh there's a recent uh mentee

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,440
for the

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
yeah yeah and that that's something

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
where you know that helped them

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,440
feel comfortable to come in and work

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
with us and know they'd have people who

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,520
would talk to them and

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
it it makes me think that you know we

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,680
try and do everything in github as much

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
as we can to be transparent to let

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
people participate across the time zones

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
but at least for me that that sort of

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
personal touch of being able to talk to

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,840
people

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
sometimes is invaluable in making that

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
you know somebody comfortable

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
and and being able to ask the questions

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
in a little bit maybe more comfortable

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,360
situation than

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
you know putting them into it to github

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
so i think that that that part's a key

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
thing that we'll need to continue to

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
work on

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
yeah that's a good point i think that

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
you know um

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,599
there are lots of ways to get involved

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
whether through you know github and

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
issues

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
and such but also like you said that the

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,800
personal touch stuff with

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,319
with slack um and and in the meetings as

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
well

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
i guess the flip side though of making

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
you know bringing more and more people

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
into the

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,280
the project and making them comfortable

00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
to speak up which is which was what we

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
want

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,000
is that consensus can actually be can be

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
hard sometimes the more people we get

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
involved the more different views there

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,599
are

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,560
um and so sometimes that actually can

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
can be

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,639
a bit of a challenge for the project

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
like how do we get to an answer

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,479
when we've got lots of different views

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,879
and and my personal view is

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,759
is that sometimes it should be hard if

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
we're making a

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,120
a big decision it's better to have that

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,000
stretch out a little bit longer

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,240
to factor in all the different views and

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
often i've seen that result in a better

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
decision in the end it

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
i'll admit it can be quite tiring and

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,519
you know we you know that's one of our

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
challenges is how do we find the right

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
balance here because we don't want

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,760
people to be so exhausted from the

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,959
discussions

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
that they don't want to contribute

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,800
anymore but at the same time you know i

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
think we need to

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
not rush some of these discussions

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
because we we need to get everybody's

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
input and see if we can find something

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
where

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,640
where there is a consensus yeah i think

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,640
balance is the key word there for sure

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,399
and i think you know in terms of getting

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,880
people's input

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,080
a good example is the the surveys work

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
that we've been doing

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,800
um you know with with the next 10 effort

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,040
and the unhandled promise rejection

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
work um those are really great ways to

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,120
get people's input

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,839
um yeah and that's like not necessarily

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
a survey to

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
decide the question but to give us some

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
additional input

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
and context for how how we try and you

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,839
know come to a

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,480
to a consensus within the project itself

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,560
and the project's structured in a way

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
that when it comes to it we have the

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,480
technical steering committee that can

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,120
vote on um particular issues topics pr's

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
where consensus hasn't been able to be

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
met

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
for for a significant portion of time

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,720
but the

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
we do try to avoid that we hope that

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
consensus can be resolved out in the

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
community amongst the wider collaborator

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,480
contributed base

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
rather than being elevated to seek to

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
make a decision

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,920
but obviously in some cases if it's gone

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
on for a few months you do want that

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
kind of

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,279
escape hatch to make sure that things

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,480
can move forward and

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,560
not just indefinitely blocked

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,519
yeah consensus can be challenging but i

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,240
think it's uh

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
it's it's definitely a feature and and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
you know when we merged the two

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
foundations together the js foundation

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
and the nodejs foundation to form the

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,040
openjs foundation we took a lot of

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,200
the learnings that we had in

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
you know building this open open source

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
space in the node.js

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,279
foundation and tried to bring that over

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,800
to the open.js foundation which i think

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
you know uh has has been successful

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,959
yeah i think i think it you know and one

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,640
of the reasons why that makes so much

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,600
sense is that the project the node.js

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
experience

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
it embodies a lot of those things that

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,120
are important for

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
individuals and companies who want to

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,279
rely

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,120
on you know packages and products and

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
projects in their production

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
environments it has that

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
you know sort of open and level playing

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
field where

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
you know if you if you come and you can

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,920
contribute

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
you can move things forward your voice

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
is heard

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
we take everybody's views into into the

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
consensus versus you know if you

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,519
have a project which is predominantly

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,760
run say from by your competitor

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
you may not be nearly as comfortable as

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
depending on that as

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
as one that would be under this kind of

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,040
model and the opengs foundation is a

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
great place to

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800
sort of foster that experience because

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
if you if you move from

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,120
say a single company uh you know

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
supporting the open source project you

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
need somebody else some other

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,240
organization to step in and take up some

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
of the pieces that they would have done

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
you know providing the things like zoom

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,079
accounts and emailing lists and

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
just sort of the basic resources that

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
are available within a company but

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
aren't necessarily

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
freely available to an open source

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,440
project unless they're part of a

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,360
foundation or something like that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
yeah i agree it's like it's a single

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,839
home for you know the js ecosystem

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,120
um to be you know stable and um

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
you know uh growing well you know and

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
especially for

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,760
companies who want to support that work

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
but like you said it's it's it's a place

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,920
to grow that work as well

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
to have the support from the foundation

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
to do things like the surveys

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
um the package maintenance work and and

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
there's

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,920
you know there's there's so much stuff

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,800
that we can do to really support the

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,240
community at the foundation level

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,839
yeah and the other thing i'm i'm kind of

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,000
excited about i'll just quickly mention

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
is like the collaboration spaces so the

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
foundation you know

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
from the beginning has supported

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
projects and collaboration spaces are

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,480
another way where we can support

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,480
discussions initiatives which are not

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
necessarily a project but are also very

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
important to

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,240
the ecosystem the java eco ecosystem

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,760
overall

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
yeah we can we can talk a moment too

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
about like why why people get involved

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
and i think you know that that

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,480
collaboration space is a great place to

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,920
get involved but like

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,160
you know you in my experience

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
uh working at companies that use open

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
source you know you want to get

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,480
involved in the project and help uh

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,320
you know fix bugs keep things stable uh

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
you may need features you know there are

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,800
so many different reasons why you would

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,680
want to get involved in open source

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,320
yeah i find so sorry go ahead bethany

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,959
yeah

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
i find um maybe folks at smaller or

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,680
medium-sized companies sometimes

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,880
struggle to get

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,639
their employers to appreciate

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,320
why they should contribute to open

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
source and i found

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
over time the best way of it being

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,519
framed is

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
if you're consuming these projects in

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,199
your company

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,240
and consuming open source and using it

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,959
to stand upon and deliver your service

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
and by allowing your employees to

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
contribute

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
you're actually helping manage the risk

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
because

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,040
uh if someone stops maintaining that

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,079
dependency or the open source project

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,720
you're using

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,480
uh you're gonna be rather stuck and you

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,680
will have to invest that time

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,880
so why not up front try to invest some

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
time

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
spread out across you know your

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,399
development year to just

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,399
help keep these dependencies stable

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,160
yeah and i guess in terms of the risk is

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
like i often see

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,000
issues which are like hey i'm having

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,600
this problem and then you can see people

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
are getting frustrated in those issues

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
because

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
somebody doesn't immediately answer them

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,600
but like the reality is you're using a

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
project you're not

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
paying anybody to support you for that

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,720
project so if people are helping you

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,399
that's because

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
you know they're volunteering their time

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,120
they think it's in the project's overall

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,040
best interest

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,279
but you shouldn't depend on somebody

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
else necessarily being able to to have

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,560
that time for

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,440
you when you need it and by letting your

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,560
employees

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,920
in be involved and help maintain the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,440
things you depend on

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,440
you can help yourself and that's really

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,959
the position you want to be in

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
you know to either work with a partner

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,320
who will help you or to

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,240
to be able to help yourself in those

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079
projects so it's important to contribute

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
you know either directly or indirectly

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,440
to the open source projects that are

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
that are really important to you

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
yeah i think too you know at like a

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
personal level you

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
you gain amazing skills in working in

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
open source

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,199
that are valuable to a company being

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
able to work well with others

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,800
and and find consensus and and you know

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,199
work through

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,399
certain issues that come up uh often in

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,680
open source

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,560
um it's definitely a skill to uh

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160
to appreciate and then also you know

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
it's a great place to hire too

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
uh a previous company i worked at we did

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,000
a lot of work in open source and we

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
hired a couple of really great people

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
uh through that and i i got to see them

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
go on to to do

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
really great things in open source

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,800
through that work

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
yes certainly the skills that you grow

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,920
you learn in an open source project

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
apply to working in a larger company at

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
least

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,320
um where you know you're trying to get

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
things done you don't

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
can't necessarily tell what people what

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,440
to do and you have to work together in a

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,040
collaborative manner i mean i think it

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
you got to do that in every in any kind

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,240
of company so they're really great

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
skills to learn

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
yeah and it's really a great way of

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
building building your personal kind of

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
brand

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
around the work you're doing and i've

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,079
seen so many people

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,279
um on their resumes and cvs just saying

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,800
calling out their open source

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,320
contributions which

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,680
is great it's great that you can do the

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
work in a place where

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,639
the broader community can see what

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,959
you're doing and yeah that's a really

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
good

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,360
really good uh note

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,120
so that's kind of why to get involved um

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,040
and there are some kind of key ways you

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
could start to get involved with the

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,880
openjs foundation

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,480
and the projects within the foundation

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
and so first

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,399
um it's worth looking at all the

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,279
projects in the foundation

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,920
uh that's around 30 or so and seeing

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,680
whether

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,519
what there are ones that you use you're

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
particularly experienced with or maybe

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
just have an

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,519
interest in that given area and maybe

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,519
look at that project

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,959
and see if they have good first issues

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,560
or things like that

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,560
and particularly if you're looking to

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,199
get involved uh within the node.js

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,799
project itself we do have the structure

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,839
within the project with the teams and

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,319
working groups

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,000
and i i find a good way to find to get

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,600
involved is to look at the list of team

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,039
working groups and again

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,039
um if there's one that particularly

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,160
resonates with your interests or

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,039
your area and check out their github

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,600
repository

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,400
join their calls which will be on the

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,559
openjs foundation calendar

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
and all and all the calls are open to

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
everyone you should be able to stream

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,000
on youtube going back to the open open

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,520
source and we try to stream

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
all of our meetings so all of our

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,320
decisions are there for everyone to see

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
um and yeah so everyone's welcome to

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,039
join the meetings

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,760
uh joining events like him js world is

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,640
just a few ways you can get involved

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
yeah i i

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
as we said before it's a great way to

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
make the personal connection those teams

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,640
and working groups

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
the other thing i'd recommend is like

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
try and you know

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,880
work within your company to get them to

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
actually support your work to make it

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
more than just your side job because

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
you know we're lucky you know ibm and

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,840
red hat are very supportive

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
it's part of you know we have a portion

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,919
of our time to work in the community

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,160
and that actually makes it a lot easier

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,480
to to to contribute so

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,760
um you know working within the company

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,919
to help them understand

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
that you're actually reducing their risk

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
and that you you know you'll be there to

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,679
help

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,200
um you know fix issues identify issues

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,600
in some of these key components that

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
they're depending on i think is is also

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
a good component in terms of like how to

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,799
be able to contribute in a more

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,720
sustained and sort of long-term

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,720
long-term manner yeah yeah i'll

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,799
you know reiterate i feel very fortunate

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
that uh ibm and red hat supports the

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
work that we do and really

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
i think you know they see the value in

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the work that we do and

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,919
and contributing to open source um as it

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,559
pertains to their business

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
um but you know we to kind of get back

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
to the whole open open source thing

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,720
and to just sort of reiterate what beth

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,200
was saying as well like

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,760
there are there are lots of ways to get

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
involved

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,840
um again you know issues pull requests

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,679
um

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,679
uh openjsf.org collaborate will give you

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
a bunch of resources in terms of joining

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
the slack

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,160
um and and the calendar uh

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,440
nodejs.org calendar is where all the

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,960
node.js uh

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,960
calendar um lives and

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
again i just you know you can join a

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
meeting you can join a slack start

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,600
talking to people

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,360
um you know even if you want to join a

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
meeting and just kind of

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,640
hang out and see what's going on that's

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,640
fine too um

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,880
just uh get involved and and see what uh

where your interests lie and and start

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,960
looking there

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,720
um i guess at this point that's probably

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
all the time that we have thanks to

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,760
for coming and watching our keynote

hopefully we've given you a little bit

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
of insight into

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,320
you know the the open open source

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,640
approach that the node.js project has

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,520
some of the the things that are going on

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,280
and and have

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
sort of inspired you to get involved if

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,960
you're not not involved

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
already and you know we hope to see you

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:15,440
in github and across the projects

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:15,440
