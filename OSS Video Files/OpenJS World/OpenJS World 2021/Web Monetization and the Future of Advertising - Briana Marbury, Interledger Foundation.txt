Title: Web Monetization and the Future of Advertising - Briana Marbury, Interledger Foundation
Publication date: 2021-05-28
Playlist: OpenJS World 2021
Description: 
	Current payment structures on the web are broken and unfair. 70% of digital ad spending go to two of the internetâ€™s highest traffic platforms, which leave out a large population of developers and content creators from making a meaningful profit from their work. Until recently the web did not have native payment functionality built into its DNA, inefficient advertising business models were able to blossom and have continued to bloom. Fortunately, the introduction of Interledger has made it possible to disrupt and equalize existing payment structures. By enabling a web browser to stream micropayments, the Interledger has helped pave the way for Web Monetization, a proposed W3C standard. This presentation will focus on how Web Monetization can help ensure developers and creators are compensated for their work via an open, native, efficient, and automatic way to transfer money on the web.

hi my name is brianna marbury and i'm

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,520
the executive director of the

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,000
interledger foundation

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,200
today we're going to talk about

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,960
alternatives to online advertising

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,279
specifically web monetization

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
before we jump into the details let's

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,160
talk about

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
where the world is in regards to the

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
creative economy

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
as i speak to you today the online

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
creative space is growing exponentially

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
and since the pandemic even more people

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,360
have moved to both creating

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
and consuming a greater amount of

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
content online

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,559
here are a few statistics from the

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
policy circle

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
that show just how the digital economy

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
is growing

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
with more creators from developing

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
countries joining the ecosystem

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,000
the digital creative economy makes up

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,079
six percent of the world's gdp

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,640
with a large portion of the growth due

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,000
to 15 to 29 year olds

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,159
think instagram and tick tock

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
however the way these creators are

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,479
getting paid for their work

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,560
and subsequently the information

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,119
consumers have to give up in order to

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
consume

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,200
content is less than ideal

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
now we've all experienced going online

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
to search for something

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
and then like magic there's that same

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,280
something

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
you search for showing up as an ad on

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
the next platform or website you visit

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,280
for the next month

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
and you're like i really didn't have any

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
intention of buying those socks with my

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
dog's face on there

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,079
i just wanted to look at what it would

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
look like online

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
but now you have to suffer through

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,759
seeing these socks on

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,439
every site and platform you go to

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
because they're trying to entice you to

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,600
buy them

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,119
but studies show that people are tired

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
of invasive ads

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
which is the reason why one out of every

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
four people use some form

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,280
of an ad blocker now then there's the

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
paywalls

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
i was just trying to read an article on

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,520
a site that shall remain nameless

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,920
and hit the whole message of you've

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
reached your article limit for the month

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,039
frustrated i rolled my eyes and exited

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
off the site

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,200
in fact that's what most people do as

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
the conversion rate for pay walls is

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
very low

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
ranging from two to five percent

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
depending on what study you're

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
referencing

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
that's it i guess something is better

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
than nothing

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,720
and if you have a lot of traffic on your

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,400
site you may not be doing so bad

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,720
but two to five percent the pandemic

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
helped to boost these numbers a bit

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
but what's going to happen once people

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,720
are able to move around freely

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,519
and stop spending so much time indoors

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
and consuming content that way

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
i'm not a betting person but i'm willing

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,640
to bet

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
that increase in conversion rates that

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,800
we saw because of the pandemic

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,760
will go back down as people realize they

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,760
don't need

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,640
that subscription to underwater basket

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
weaving after all

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
here's a relatable example at least for

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
me that is

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
say for instance you're a blogger who

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720
painstakingly takes your time and effort

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
to create a beautiful site about making

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
cupcakes

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,239
since i love to bake and experiment with

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
your recipes i thoroughly enjoy your

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
website

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,400
however in efforts to mitigate your cost

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
you start allowing ads on your site

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
which have been annoying your audience

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,319
mainly me

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,640
and as we talked before lots of people

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,720
are implementing ad blockers

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
since that's not exactly producing the

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
revenue you were hoping for

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
you decide to go a step further and

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,799
implement a pay wall to encourage people

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
to subscribe to your site

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,799
and again the conversion rate is very

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,799
small

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
so when i run into this well i don't

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
mind supporting you and your ability to

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
continue making creative and innovative

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
recipes

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,200
i draw the line at pay walls and decide

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
to say forget it

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,519
and find another person that's making

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,760
recipes that i like

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,959
if this way of monetizing work online is

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,879
so bothersome to a large portion people

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,879
why is this still the pervasive model

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,439
that persists today

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,200
as you can see here these are just some

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
of the downsides of the web's current

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
business model

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,440
and you may think aside from your

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
monthly internet bill

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,199
surfing the web is supposed to be free

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,680
right well

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
no actually when the internet was

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
created

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,759
it was always intended for payments to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
be a native part of the

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,919
infrastructure it was just a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,840
functionality that wasn't utilized until

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
now

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,320
and the way the business model of the

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
web is currently

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
you're paying with your data and your

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
privacy

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
and your dating your privacy is big

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
business

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,759
seventy percent of advertising dollars

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,199
go to three of the largest platforms

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,360
because they're able to collect a

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
ridiculous amount of data on you

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,440
which they then sell to organizations

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
who get insight into your spending

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,240
habits

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
so they can know exactly how to target

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
you and what you're likely to buy

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
meanwhile the majority of creators are

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,080
not earning a meaningful wage for their

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,479
creative works

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
but we won't go deeper into that today

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,199
what we will talk about

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,960
is a solution what if there was a way

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,400
for creators to get paid without having

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
to implement ads

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
pay walls respect their users privacies

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
and

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,280
create a seamless user experience for

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,160
consumers

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,400
well there is one way to start to break

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
down this big behemoth of a machine that

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,400
has been dominating the online payment

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,600
space for almost 20 years

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,479
is through web monetization web

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,960
monetization is a proposed w3c standard

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,199
that's built on the interledger protocol

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,720
which is an open source payments network

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,919
meaning anyone has

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
access to the code and can build on it

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,520
one of the coolest features of the

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,919
protocol in my opinion

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,800
is that it has the ability to move very

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,880
small packets of currency across the web

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
which can be as small as a fraction of a

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,680
cent

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,759
these small packets known as

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
micropayments are able to be

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,199
continuously streamed from one person

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,759
or entities account to another and it's

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
all done

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,080
seamlessly behind the scenes so there's

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,240
no interruption in user experience

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,479
instead of running into paywalls and

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,440
clicking off of pop-ups to actually get

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,720
to the content you're trying to view

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,240
you get direct access easy and simple

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
right to see how this works

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,759
in the real world let's go back to the

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
example of where you're a cupcake

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
blogger

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,600
if your site was web monetized instead

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,080
of having ads and a paywall

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
i would be able to seamlessly peruse all

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,600
the cupcakes

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
recipes my heart desires while still

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,240
supporting you and your efforts to

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,120
spread joy by way of sugary goodness

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,880
and every second i spend on your site

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
you're getting micropayments stream to

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
your account

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,440
and the more traffic there is to the

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,120
site but you have

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
traffic because i've told all of my

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,919
friends about your recipes

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,560
the micropayments get streamed to you

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
it's a win-win for everybody

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
with the revenue you earn you have the

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
ability and means to experiment with new

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,639
and fun flavors like ube

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,960
which by the way i just made not too

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,680
long ago and if you haven't tried it yet

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,680
you should try it it's delicious i can

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,479
support you which i absolutely want to

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,800
do

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,400
and maintain my privacy at the same time

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
which is something that's important to

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
me

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
one thing i'd like to point out is that

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,800
this isn't an all or nothing deal

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,240
we're all about choice here and if you

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
still want to maintain

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
ads and pay walls on your site you're

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
absolutely free to do so

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
you can just add web monetization as an

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
additional revenue option

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
and while you don't have to you can

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
include special perks for web monetize

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,840
users

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
such as an extra special recipe every

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,520
week do whatever is best for you and

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
your business

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
now you may be saying this sounds great

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,560
and i want to get in on this but how

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,520
well there are a couple of ways one you

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
can sign up with coil at coil.com

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,680
right now they're the sole web

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
monetization provider

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
but we're looking forward to more in the

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,840
future this is just a snippet of their

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
site cool right

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
and signing up is so easy especially for

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
a user it takes five minutes

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
it's five dollars a month at the moment

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
and after you sign up you can download

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,039
the puma browser onto your phone

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,959
or install the coil plug-in then just

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,000
enjoy your seamless browsing experience

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,120
from there

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,680
simple and sweet if you're a creator

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
you sign up for free create a digital

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,560
wallet

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
and when a paying member of coil visits

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,600
your site

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
you get stream micropayments to your

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
wallet

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
adding web monetization to your site is

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
fairly easy too

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
and there are instructions on coil site

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,279
when you sign up

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,920
that tell you exactly how to do it

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
the ecosystem is growing day by day and

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,160
here are the browsers you can use with

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,399
coil for your seamless experience

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
the puma browser is currently the only

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,240
one with web

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,160
monetization built in natively so you

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
can sleep at night rest assured that

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
your information isn't being collected

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
and sold to the highest bidder

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,360
the other browsers listed here have a

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,680
coil extension that you can add on

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
as i said this community is growing and

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
here's just an example of some of the

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,839
sites using web monetization

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
if you're a photographer and use imager

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,640
well that site is web monetized now

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
cinnamon is a web monetized video

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,279
platform similar to youtube

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,279
but with each video you post you can get

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
micropayments streamed when viewers

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
consume your material

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,720
material and if you have a website

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
