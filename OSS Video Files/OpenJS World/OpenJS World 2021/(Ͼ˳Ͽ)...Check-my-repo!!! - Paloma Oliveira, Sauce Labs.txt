Description: 
	A demanding and complex Open Source Program Offices’ task is to guarantee the health of its organization repositories. Aiming to help OSPOs and OS communities, we, at Sauce Labs, created Check-My-Repo, an automated tool built upon Repolinter, that verifies the main necessary parameters to comply with OS best practices: from Readme to License. By automating this verification OSPO’s maintenance is more effective and effortless, and can help your organization to have compliant software projects easier to service, test, upgrade, and maintain. Built with Node.js, Repolinter and Vue.js, it is designed to run local and automated, displaying results on GitHub page. Just fork it and adjust it to your own configurations using a simple json file. That easy :) This talk is about the importance of such a tool, how it was designed and the benefits it brings to your organization.
