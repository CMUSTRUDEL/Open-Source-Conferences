Description: 
	A demanding and complex Open Source Program Offices’ task is to guarantee the health of its organization repositories. Aiming to help OSPOs and OS communities, we, at Sauce Labs, created Check-My-Repo, an automated tool built upon Repolinter, that verifies the main necessary parameters to comply with OS best practices: from Readme to License. By automating this verification OSPO’s maintenance is more effective and effortless, and can help your organization to have compliant software projects easier to service, test, upgrade, and maintain. Built with Node.js, Repolinter and Vue.js, it is designed to run local and automated, displaying results on GitHub page. Just fork it and adjust it to your own configurations using a simple json file. That easy :) This talk is about the importance of such a tool, how it was designed and the benefits it brings to your organization.

	00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,040
hi so

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,320
today i'm here to talk about

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,920
rules or common agreements

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,560
so first question is

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,840
why do we even create this sort of thing

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,359
well basically we want to live together

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
right it's a community and in

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
certain communities and small or bigger

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,199
we discuss

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,880
and say i like this and i like the

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,280
orange and i like the pink but how

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
how how are these basic things that we

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
can do

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
so we all can feel better living

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,480
together

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
this is where we come up with those

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,600
common agreements

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
i will give you an example in my house i

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,800
live with george

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,000
george that happens to be a cat

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,039
by nature likes a lot birds like

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
this dove with the air on it

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,000
and when in the spring like an hour the

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
birds start coming and they are super

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,080
hungry so i feed them i live in front of

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
a park they're here all the time i feel

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
they're hungry i just feed them and

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
george of course wants to play with them

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,960
but when he plays they got hurt

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,240
so it's not cool then we got together

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,320
me the birds george i got let's no

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
we need an agreement here this is not

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,040
working

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,280
so the deal is george you cannot

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,119
eat the birds nor try to play with them

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
because they get hurt

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,200
but you you get cookies and then the

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
birds are happy

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
i am happy george

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,840
[Music]

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
george not so much but he's also happy

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
but he's like but i was still in the

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,640
window and i will always scare them when

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
i get too pissed okay

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
otherwise i'm like but i need to

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,479
but i would not touch them

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,320
cool we have an agreement

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,439
but why

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,039
why do we even follow such

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:12,560
rules i got the feeling the most of them

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,599
to be honest it's uh merely the

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
convenience or wouldn't whatever i think

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,480
about it

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
or it's just we think it's just a bit

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
logical

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
for example in the most of the western

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,640
places

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,920
we tend to form the lines there's a lot

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,640
for limes and no one likes it

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
but it works and if i wake up in the

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,480
morning

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,720
and i just want a warm bread i just

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,040
there's five different people we kind of

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
understand who arrived first and we form

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
a line and wait and

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,080
we kind of know the time we'll get there

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,280
it's not a rule but it's kind of a

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,480
best practice per se

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,440
i of course uh don't need to follow this

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,840
but it will take me a lot of energy and

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
we can just say no i don't want line and

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
we can

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,120
get a group and reinvent this best

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,480
thing that will work for everyone

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
sometimes it is necessary to not to

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,640
follow this route

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
then you know what

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,800
break it smash

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,560
i am the first one to raise my hand

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
and say please reinvent this room this

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
is not

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,000
working just like mr duro

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,519
wrote in his fabulous resistance to

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,440
civil government book

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,400
as known as aka civil disobedience

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
and disobedience is great it's awesome

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
this is why

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,920
for example we have open source right

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,519
open source was started was born

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,080
when someone defied a rule say no no i

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,879
don't i don't want copyright

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
i don't want this law by that is by

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,720
default to exist

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
i want to create my own law and have the

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,519
right to allow

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,560
others to copy distribute modify this

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
code

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,840
beautiful but wow

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,680
what is what is open source

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,880
well one could say that open source is a

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,720
very technical definition about source

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,680
code that is open

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,360
again to copy modify and distribute

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
traditional by the book

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
others by the other hand may defend that

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,919
before you even think about open source

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
you

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,320
have to participate and understand

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,040
what collaboration means what it means

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,080
to collaborate this is the basic

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,479
so start to get together the open with

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,759
the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,400
collaboration principles

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,880
i understand it's because open source is

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
not

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,759
adverb not one thing it can be a

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,199
workflow

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,080
a philosophy that indeed went way over

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,320
just code and approach of course to

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,479
software development

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,360
it's definitely way much more than just

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,759
hitting push push and public into a

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,280
public repository

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:23,440
my personal definition is that

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,440
open source is an ecosystem

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,600
and by ecosystem um that means that it's

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
composed not by one thing

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
it's like technical things like code but

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,639
mostly

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,520
by people writing the code

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
or doing other things that it's just not

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,199
cold

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,919
every project shall have its own

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
tribalistic culture

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,759
and probably they will have a social

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
noise

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,600
and just like the place in the calling

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,680
to this public repository will not

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
achieve this idea of being charitable

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,800
means that i'm open to the other this

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
one i do not know

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
it's not me and this author should be

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
able

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,160
to participate somehow in the project

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
that's the meaning and the idea of open

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,280
right

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,280
but people are very very confident

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
independent of your definition what you

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
want to do

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
how do you think about open source can

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
we have reading one thing

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
i mean to think about open sources to

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,520
think about

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,639
sharing and having this property of

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
enabling

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,720
sharing but to share

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,440
we need to communicate something and

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,120
this

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,639
is another very complex human thing

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,360
communication you think about

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,080
communication theory for example

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
you need someone giving the message and

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,759
someone

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,000
receiving the message with a medium

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,599
that will get in between in this case

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
like a

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,680
the sound voice

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,680
my brain receiving the mouth so

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,160
there's the message the myth emitter

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
and the ones receiving it and the medium

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
in between

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,880
this is basics theory

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
have you ever played like uh to make it

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
more

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,919
explicit have you ever played this

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,599
child's play called the broken telephone

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
there is other names for it

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,120
but basically you have someone just like

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
in the picture you

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
spread you whisper something and then

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
the other

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
will hear and will pass along to the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,560
next to the next next and to the end

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
and then the fun part is that the first

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,960
one will compare with the last

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
one and it's it's super fun when they

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,720
are

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,520
not the same and i mean

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,080
if you said in the beginning i want to

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,599
play with george and at the end i hear

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,639
i wanna

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,440
uh kick george i would be

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
super mad super super mad but then you

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,759
just wanted to play right

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,599
so it's not fun when the noise happened

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:17,919
in some circumstances right

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
what what

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,479
this is nice i guess

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
but this we're talking about that's last

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,519
well

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,919
one of the theories right we could use

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,360
this this person there

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,479
communication message medium

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,600
receiver the effect it calls this

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,279
was like a um

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,160
an image for that and this is linear

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
and you got into this whole complexity

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,360
no one

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,480
understanding anything george it

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
happened something

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,880
to him that we don't know what happened

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,920
noise but

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,000
an open source project it's

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,399
not a linear and usually there are

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,839
several messages coming

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,959
from all around asynchronously

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,720
and then whoa how how

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,800
we can imagine so we give this example

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080
just this linear really control thing

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
but an open source that's

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
not as controlled it's very basically

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,200
the centralized thing

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,279
most of the time or partially one other

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,279
way to explain or try to think about it

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,839
it's mcluhan mcluhan it's

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,480
a canadian philosopher it's one of the

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
cornerstones of media theory

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
and there is this really famous phrase

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,680
from him where he says

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,720
the medium is the message or it could be

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,760
in that case the whisper the whisper is

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
by the force

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,880
something that it's not clear and loud

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
and it's meant to be a little disturbing

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
but he also said the medium is the

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,959
massage and what does he mean by that

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,160
by massage

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,600
he meant to denote

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,000
the effect of numerous medias and how

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
they

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,560
massaged the human censorion he's

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
talking not about

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
the proper content but all the

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,200
surroundings and how

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,519
we are perceiving um

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
because humans are made of several types

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,640
of perceptions work not only

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,640
reading or not only hearing or not even

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,440
the something in between that we haven't

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
named

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,399
yet or will never do so not only the

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,240
message comes to play

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,200
but also how this message is sent

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,360
that would be a little bit more complex

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,399
and then we have other theories

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,040
there's parallels but there's

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,880
many others and in verbal for example

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,320
you see that the source

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,279
comes from many places from attitude

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
from knowledge

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,160
and the message and you have the element

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
the treatment you have a coding

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,519
you have the channel and the channel

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:13,279
can be smiling or yelling

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,040
and you have how am i receiving this

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,519
which culture do i come from may

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,360
influentiate in this perception for

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,440
example

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
and this is interesting to note

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
especially in open source

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,959
because one of the challenges of open

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,240
source is dealing with information

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,680
imbalance let's take this image for

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
example

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,000
here you have a case of a doctor that

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,120
contains some information

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,160
hey it's free free data

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,440
use it all there but if i do not

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,279
have this specifically knowledge

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,079
uh or before this it's created an

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
asymmetry of knowledge where only me who

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,639
detains

00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:01,040
the the corner sensitive knowledge can

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:05,040
actually understand or decipher this

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,639
data this information and that's

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,399
information imbalance what happened

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,880
is that we of course by nature like

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,639
i can have my pit maintainer and just

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,040
send a signal message and say yo

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,000
let's do that cool but what about all

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
the other people

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,320
that wants to contribute so think about

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,440
this wall we have this closed wall

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
but what it's after behind this wall we

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
should make

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,839
um have mechanisms or ways to

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,800
communicate in a way

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
that everyone is in equal footing index

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,320
in terms of

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
access to information and the ability

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,120
also to influentiate this project

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,000
otherwise why would that be open right

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
and that could be in a number of ways

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,680
procedural

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
and daily communication and long term

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
what do i mean by that

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,120
procedural it's like the way we do

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,680
things for example having

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,360
one public issue tracker instead of

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
having two different ones very close and

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
a very open

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
the other one is how do i remedy and

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
then making this available

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,240
for people to have a chance to sit on

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
the table and having

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
a proper discussion about the changes

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,480
that in

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
its opinion needs to be made and on

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,160
daily communication

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,760
is the basic stuff like how's the status

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,560
is this just a proof of concept

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
it's been actually becoming active is

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
that deprecated

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,800
or things just like how do i even submit

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
an issue this is daily worries

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,320
or long-term long-term communication

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
like

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
how i was recommended because i just

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
arrived i want to start now

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
but i don't know where you were where

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
you are you project

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
so can i have a road map or

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,959
understanding the philosophy so i can

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
get in

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,120
and already know kind of the social

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
norms

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,839
and where we are standing at the moment

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
for example

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
just like open source it's not equal

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
just

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,240
a repository would open available code

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,680
is all of this ecosystem right

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,160
and working asynchronous and

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,839
asynchronously

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,240
it's a very big characteristics of open

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,560
source

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
this is another reason for as much as

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,040
possible although we do

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,040
have this

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,720
interesting creative yeah disobedience

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,519
inside of us

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,040
as clear as possible having some best

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,560
practices

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
it is a cool thing in this case

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:47,519
so part two

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,120
we already understand why does the rules

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,560
are therefore right i think i think yeah

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,519
i think so i hope i convinced you enough

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,000
but can you imagine how can you apply

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,839
all these rules if you're maintaining or

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,199
overseeing or making sure hundreds

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,800
dozens or hundreds of repositories

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,320
are healthy are having this clear

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,240
communication this

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,560
is crazy and

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
we understand that maintainers needs to

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,920
be multitasking

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,040
maintainers uh it's

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,760
yeah are the ones who are being part of

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,120
the project

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,320
and being part it's not only having

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,079
awesome really cool clear code

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,880
it's having um taking care of the

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,720
community

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,279
taking care of the engagement

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,560
participating collaborating

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,600
governance it's like there's tons of

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
tasks

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,959
it is a lot of work and a lot of

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,480
interwoven work

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,800
and more recently there is also

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
someone else in the game which are the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,639
ospos

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
the open source program office those are

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
the ones that

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
yeah they have to take care of a lot of

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,839
places and a lot of places has to be

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,600
really healthy

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,440
because ospo's main thing

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,839
is to make sure

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,560
the organization's repositories are

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,680
healthy and

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,959
aligned with the company's strategies

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,000
and this is why check my ripple

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,920
was created hey

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,560
to make sure that we're helping you

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
to have healthier repositories but what

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,880
what are you talking about

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,839
i'll show you this is check my ripple it

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,600
is designed

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
to be as

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
neutral as possible so more like a rgb

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,079
colors

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,040
dark mode high contrast

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,320
complying with accessibility using view

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
axe

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,240
check for lackey so it is

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,559
made to be a website that you can just

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,839
 use it and call your own

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:15,439
it does uses github actions behind

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,520
so we just grab your repository and

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,280
link it all and make sure it is

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,240
complying with open source best

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,520
practices

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,120
it is built with ripple enter which is

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,280
another open source project

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,440
maintained by to do group which is super

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,000
important for the open source community

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
and that's what it does it just looks

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
like an ah do you have this that make

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
this code more clean we have this and

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,919
this

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
but what are this what are this thing

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
i'm talking about

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,000
those are some rules that we expect or

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
best practice that we expect all the

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,200
repositories to have

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,200
and

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,440
[Music]

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
before i get into what each rule does

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,799
and why they're important

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
i just want to say that this is

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,919
automated this is why i use like a

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,919
github actions for it

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,120
because we used to have in my department

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
i am from

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
uh south labs open source program office

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
department

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
and before we create that we used to do

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,799
that by hand using

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,039
an classic excel spreadsheet

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,400
and it was cool for a while but we

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,880
supervise we make sure

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,799
the repositories are healthy we do not

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
maintain them per se

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,120
so one day you have it all updated and

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,840
the next day maybe all they're done

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,000
or do you have 200 other rules failing

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,720
because they just change everything

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
which is their freedom to choose right

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,919
this is why automation is

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,200
so helpful it makes this multitasking

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:47,200
complex word effortless and

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,160
makes you with much more tools to being

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,080
able to act

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
upon what it's failing and what you need

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,840
to do to improve your organization

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
repositories so let's take a look on the

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,080
rules

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:05,919
check my repo uses by default 11 rules

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,240
and we create those badges

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,440
if you go to the website like i did it's

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,520
3 badges

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,919
in three priorities the high ones are

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
the red ones let's take a look on what i

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,120
consider them

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:22,320
of course you can choose it but danger

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,760
those are the dangerous one first of all

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,080
the binaries is the security rule

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,919
it looks for binary files executables

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,799
and passwords which of course

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
should not for security reasons

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,480
contained

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,880
in an open source project the other one

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,600
is licensed because compliance with open

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,799
source software requirements it's

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,720
so necessary and most of the projects

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,960
are composed by several open source

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,919
which has had each one it's on

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
uh license and things can get crazy this

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,080
mixing and matching

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,559
that's why when you ensure you already

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,840
tell

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:04,400
your user in advance the permission the

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,400
mission is allowed or not to do as a

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
it's essential for you to use it but

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,600
also to protect

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,640
you maintainer legally so this is why

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
license is

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,559
the first thing cool to have in a

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
project the other one is to read me

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,000
it's like at this entrance door to your

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
project

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,120
where it's like hi hello welcome

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,280
this is what it's not only how um

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,159
what is written but how it's written so

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,520
this read me

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,240
when it's welcoming and giving you all

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,840
the

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,600
primary information you need to know

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,919
the best your project will be and that

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,720
would be like the highly recommended

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,840
first high super do not have a project

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,919
without that

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,559
and then when you have time because it's

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,799
all about balance right

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,159
you have the medium budget

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,240
medium not because they're less

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,120
important but because without them you

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,120
can kind of

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
have in an okay ish but that will of

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
course make your project

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
be much more welcome and easier for

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,760
people to contribute

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,520
change log for example makes it way much

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,799
easier for people to understand the

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,440
actual development

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,480
state or if it's lacking lots of

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,520
maintenance

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,440
and they decided to go for it or not

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,799
the checkmate rebel will look either for

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,360
a document that say

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,360
change log or if it has a release

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,080
release tag on github

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,679
the contributing guideline oh this is my

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
favorite because it's like a guiding

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,200
hand

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,360
it will tell you hopefully very

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,400
didactically all the resources how do

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,159
you do it how to start step by step

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,960
is a guiding hand for the eager

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,039
contributor the ownership is how do you

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,640
search for who owned the things so then

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,360
you can get in touch and

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,760
make decisions propose things and the

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,840
test directory is what

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,120
helps a lot your project to keep a good

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,960
code without breaks

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,120
and with avoiding lots of regressions

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,640
helps you assure your additional

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,640
confidence of your project

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,000
and of course your user satisfaction

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,280
makes sense right and what about what i

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,039
say low well it's not low

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,480
because it doesn't matter but it's like

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,919
those very nice

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,880
birds in the background they are super

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,640
good to have

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,320
they harmonize the things and

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,039
for example the code of conduct it's

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
not that the project cannot exist with

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,480
but it will

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,039
surely avoid loads of headaches and

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,679
dramas and telenovelas which i do like

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,840
but

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,960
it will avoid lots of them if you just

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,039
keep it by the four yay no

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,640
you cannot kick george for example it's

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,679
my cat you cannot

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,799
do something else than love him

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,520
for example right

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,640
yeah so that also fosters welcoming

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,720
community because me

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
if i'm very introvert or i don't know

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,000
what happens in my life before i can

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,840
have my own traumas

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,039
and if it state that this project

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,320
protects me from that

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,360
of course i will feel welcome license on

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
readme

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
license it is valid if it's just on the

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,320
readme but if you have a file and

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
also it's a nice to have in the readme

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,960
because

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,120
again it's your open door it's where

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,760
everything you need to know it's there

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,799
security is where it's like your

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
emergency button

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,280
help which is very easy to find

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,120
and you can easily act upon

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,400
something needs to be done in an

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,120
emergency case

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,120
and the support file it's what describe

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
basically how can the user get help so

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,360
how can i be

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
supported with communication channels

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,000
and avoiding lots of noise on that

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,039
uh cool those are basically the rules

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,850
and

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,480
we're getting almost to the last part

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,480
[Music]

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,080
so how to how to and i will show you a

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,440
live demo

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,880
haha literally forget

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:25,120
you into your repository

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,880
and then you go to settings

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,960
in settings you enable actions

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
sometimes just click there is not enough

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,080
but you just check

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,360
after yeah yeah you just check if

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,520
they are make sure it is allowed you

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,120
tell the deployment to happen using the

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,159
github pages

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,159
and voila

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
you have a check my repo to call you're

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,840
on

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,640
and the first time you do it you will

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
see there is there

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
still sauce labs information on it it's

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,640
because you have actions

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,159
it's set up to run on and redeploy every

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,279
time you do a push to main

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,880
or in cron zero zero time average kind

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,600
of a midnight

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,159
so it may take a little bit a while to

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
see your

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:19,200
actual informations there

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,720
and i thank you all

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,840
so so much for spending this time with

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,520
us

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,799
um if you have any doubts or would like

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,159
to contribute you're

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,320
obviously welcome i am paloma oliveira

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
probably part of open source program

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,200
office and sauce labs

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,720
and if you check if you like it but you

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,279
want to change a few things you're

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,240
it's open call your honor check my repo

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,080
in the contribution guidelines there's

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,200
the guides on how can you put

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,400
more rules less rules change the colors

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,960
change the budgets

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,360
and do the adject adjustments enough but

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,159
it should all be simple

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,799
and will describe trying to make it as

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:11,790
clear

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:14,260
and less noisy as possible for you

00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,260
