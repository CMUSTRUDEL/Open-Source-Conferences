Description: 
	With the rise of micro services more and more project are now split between multiples repositories. As this change ease the comfort of writing code and tests the solutions it also greatly increase the number of projects and so the time needed to handle everything from configuration to maintenance. With the serverless architecture this trend is having an even greater impact on productivity. One micro service can now be split on more than 30 projects and each time you would have to update a dependence you now have to do it 30 times. But each company can easily overcome this hurdles by spending a bit of time improving their process thanks to automation. In this talk I will show you and share some feedback on how a small team can handle more than 100 serverless functions thanks to automation
