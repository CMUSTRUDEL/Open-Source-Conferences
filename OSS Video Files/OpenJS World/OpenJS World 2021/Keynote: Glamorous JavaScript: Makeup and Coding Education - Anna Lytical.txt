hi i'm analytical the sickeningly

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,919
entertaining and educational coding

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,240
drag queen and i'm so excited to join

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,599
you at openjs world

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,200
i am a tech education content creator

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,880
and i basically just make videos with

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
entertaining code examples

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,880
i share my programming journey and help

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,119
others on theirs

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
and occasionally i have very snarky

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
tweets about things that bother me in

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
tech

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
i am so excited to present to you a

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
sickening code example today but

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
before i start this might be many of

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
your first time

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,000
seeing drag and drag is just a way to

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,280
play with self-expression

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,160
subvert gender and for me be very extra

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
and really think into my full

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
personality

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,840
it's a staple of the lgbtq plus

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
community which i am a part of happy

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,800
pride

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,960
but anyone can do drag regardless of

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
their gender or orientation i know that

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,840
was a long spiel but if the first bitter

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
zombie speaking is grabbed your

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
attention

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
be sure to stay up to date with all of

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,400
my glamorous coding content on twitter

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,640
youtube instagram and tick tock

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,479
you can find me at the analytical and

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
you can also just google coding drag

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,680
queen and

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,920
i will come up i wanted to give you all

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
an opportunity to learn something new

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
through a lens that might be familiar

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,080
we're gonna do some coding

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,479
but then we're gonna do some makeup and

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
we're really gonna do them together

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
once we get through that i think you'll

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
have a pretty good idea of my style

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
of content and we can talk a little bit

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,479
about the broader scope of content

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
creation

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
how to not be intimidated by it and how

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
to bring your own personality into it

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,200
i'm going to show you how i made this

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
gorgeous purple eyeshadow look today

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
this is the plan so i gotta go take it

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
off so we can get started

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,240
but be right back hi

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,680
i'm back um you know what i bet

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
all of you think javascript is so

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,159
powerful well it has

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,159
nothing on eyeshadow and eyelashes for a

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
drag queen with any program

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,280
we need our packages we need the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
materials

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
and this is really going to be whatever

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
you can get your hands on if you want to

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
follow along

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,080
so we'll need an eyeshadow palette

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
ideally very colorful

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
i actually have two that we're going to

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,120
use today some brushes

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,000
some like fluffy ones uh if you can get

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
like a flat

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
more like a flat one concealer eyelashes

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
these are really gonna

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
make everything pop we need the lash

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
glue to adhere them

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
a liner and mascara if you think this is

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
a lot of packages

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,360
you you know what you don't want to see

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
everything it takes to get this

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
full fantasy even just up to this point

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
but through all the materials and the

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
imports for the eyeshadow palette

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,959
ideally

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
if you're gonna go try to find one you

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
can find one that's really colorful this

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
one's really colorful

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
sometimes you gotta import a second

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
package to get that one function and

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
it's like

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
i really like this one because that's

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,440
this really nice this really nice purple

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
in here

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
but this other one i have has all these

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
really nice glitters so it's like

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
you know you just gotta import both of

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,200
them with code or with makeup

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
importing another package has its costs

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
with code

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
you know it could make your app slower

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,879
or larger or more confusing to

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
contribute to

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,319
and with makeup i don't have that much

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,760
room in my new york city apartment to

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
keep everything there is definitely a

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
cost and also

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
you know to import a package can be kind

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
of free but like these are not free

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,440
so when i like to represent things in

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
the real world with code i love to make

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
a class

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
so this is my eye well it's not my eye

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
it's an

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,720
eye i googled an eye and it has all

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,239
these parts nicely labeled already so

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,720
we're going to stick with it there's

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
like a grid around like the main area

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
that kind of captures most of the points

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,360
but then there are a few points like in

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
the inner corner or maybe up here or

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
like

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
below that aren't captured so they're

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
labeled separately let's just focus on

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
something

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
the grid for now i made a class for an

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
eye

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,959
i threw a 2d array in there for that

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
main eye grid

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,640
and then i added a few individual

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,319
variables just to indicate if the lashes

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
are applied the liner is applied and

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,480
then a lower lash line color

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
the grid is obviously very helpful

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
because you know the precise locations

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
for where you're going to put everything

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
but a real eyeshadow tutorial isn't

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,760
going to be saying okay go to index

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,920
0 0 of your eye and apply pink very

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,239
gently with a small brush no no

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,040
they say i'll put some color like in

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,720
your crease

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
or your outer v so there are a few

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
common areas i've added so there's the

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,919
lid outer v

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
inner corner crease and the outer area

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,160
now that we've got the basics of our

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
grid and the areas within that grid and

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,120
even outside there let's add a function

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
apply color

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,160
that will take in a color and an area

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
and

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
use a 4h loop to just apply the color to

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,759
that whole area

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
we might also want to get the color for

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,720
that area so i added a getter here

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
one last thing before we actually start

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
putting the makeup on i know

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,520
we are excited we just need a print

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
function so we can see

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
what's going on check our progress we're

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,919
gonna keep things fairly simple we're

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
just gonna use the standard

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,600
print for our 2d array use a template

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
string to print out the lower lash line

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
color

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,320
and unconditionally print if we've

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,600
applied our liner and our lashes

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
oh my god it's make up time i'm going to

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
start out by just making a new eye

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
object

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
i got two right here but we're just

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
going to work on one for now we're going

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
to grab some of this

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
light purple color and just get it all

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
over this like fluffy brush

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
and then we're just gonna take it and

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,840
apply it all around this lighter area

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,840
now once this is done we can go in i'm

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
gonna go in with like a bit more of a

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
dense brush i'm gonna go and get this

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
like really the really vibrant purple

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
i definitely want to be careful with it

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
because otherwise it could get

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,280
really messy so i'm just gonna kind of

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
stamp that

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,560
in and i know i said i was gonna do this

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
on the whole crease

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
but i kind of like to do it just on the

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
sides now

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
we could leave it like this but to get a

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,960
more natural look

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,240
natural well i guess to get a more

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
polished look

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,320
um we want to blend these out so it's

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
time for a new function

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
we're going to take the two areas in our

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,240
function they'll be our inputs

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,520
we'll get their color and then again

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
because it's kind of rudimentary we're

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
just gonna add the strings

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
nothing too fancy so i'm gonna go grab a

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,840
new brush and really start to blend

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
this out

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
there now that is so much better it's

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,919
just so soft and all the edges are

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,919
really

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,600
blurred now we need to add just a little

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
bit more in depth of the darker one from

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
in here

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,440
so and i'm gonna just apply that to my

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
outer v it's just being very

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
precise of where where i'm putting

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
things but like you know

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,880
in the end if you've got purple all over

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,680
your eye you're going to look great

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,000
you're going to feel

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
great i will then just blend the crease

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,880
and the outer v

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
now this is looking great we could stop

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,120
here but i

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,680
am a drag queen i mean i've got purple

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,039
all over my face and purple hair

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,120
um so i wanna go bigger and bolder and

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,479
one way to do that is with glitter

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,479
but right now there's kind of a lot of

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,360
stuff going on on my eye so we're going

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,039
to do a cut

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
crease it sounds super fancy and it's

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,199
like a very hot and trending

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,120
makeup term but it just means we're

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
going to reset some of our areas

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,560
once the reset we can apply glitter and

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,160
have it really pop we're going to need

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
to add a new area for where our cut

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
crease will be so it's basically like

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,479
kind of the edge of the lid and then

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
maybe in the inner corner a little bit

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,800
and then we just reset that to an empty

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
string

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
with makeup though you just grab your

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
concealer and you can put it directly on

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
your eye

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,680
or grab your angled brush or any kind of

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,440
flat brush and you just basically carve

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
it out and get all that free

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
new real estate there is so much more

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,080
space and it's so much sharper and

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
defined

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,919
now on to my favorite part the glitter

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,960
eyeshadows you don't even really need a

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,080
brush or glitter i kind of mentioned

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
this earlier you can just take your

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,680
finger and you get a lot more

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
color and vibrancy when you do it like

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
this so i just kind of take my finger

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
and tap it on

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,720
gently and for a smaller area you could

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,520
just grab it on your pinky

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
and it'll be great now the final colors

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
that we need to add is just the lower

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
lash line

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,960
so i can take i kind of like to use like

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,319
a more like

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,479
firm brush for this so it doesn't get

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,199
everywhere and then i'm just gonna go

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
drag it around there i'm gonna go apply

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
my lashes and liner

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
off camera do any finishing touches for

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
my completed look and i'll also

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
obviously do the other eye but i will be

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
right

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,599
back hi

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
i'm back and beautiful

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,440
the completed look is here we just

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
cleaned up

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,479
things a little bit i really didn't even

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
do that much on this eye

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,120
it's like the power of the lash but

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
other than that i just duplicated it on

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
the other eye

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,080
threw on some nails here we've also got

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
the final code

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
and i'm sure you are eagerly awaiting to

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,279
find out

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,320
what the output of all of this is and

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
here you go i think you know it's a

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
tough call

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
of who wore it better but as long as

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,480
we're both feeling beautiful

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,040
it's fully a win in my books but yes

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,959
i'm feeling my purple fantasy and i'm

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
also feeling my teaching fantasy thank

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,760
you so much for letting me teach

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
you a little bit about makeup or maybe a

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
little bit about code

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
and this is what i do i take something

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,000
that people know

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,680
maybe it's makeup maybe it's drag comedy

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
for most of you watching this video it's

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,600
probably javascript code

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
and i combine it with something new i

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
take all the things that i love

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
and help people draw connections to

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,080
things that they love

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
and show that you know makeup and code

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
aren't that different coding can be

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
creative

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,480
and there isn't a specific kind of

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,600
person that can be an engineer

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
you know i view the path as to becoming

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
a great engineer or to

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,000
even helping someone become a great

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
engineer as a ladder

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
each step might be clear you know but

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,279
sometimes the rungs seem really far

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
apart or maybe the ladder seems really

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,160
taller you know what maybe you left your

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
ladder in the shed and don't even know

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,720
where the shed

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,120
is this might be the typical ladder into

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
tech it's a very easy one or not easy

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,000
but it's you know a

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
very standard path there maybe start

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,680
with intro cs maybe do some data

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,279
structures maybe an algorithms course

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
some kind of software engineering or web

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,440
development course and then get a job

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
but you know that only works if you have

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
all the knowledge and the resources

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
available to take that path

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
you may not even know about some of

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,200
those courses that you need to take and

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
might get left out

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
this might be the latter for someone

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,160
who's just getting into coding

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
maybe they know about you know some of

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
the free online resources like free code

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
camp

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
they think maybe they could take a class

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
but you know what maybe they're even too

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,279
intimidated to sign up for that class

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
because they think they don't have the

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,480
right knowledge to go into it

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,720
and even even in the intro cs class

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,839
the rungs could be really far apart just

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
to get through

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
each lesson it might feel like you're

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,839
stretching so far beyond

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
what your arms reaches and that's really

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
scary

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,240
so this is where my content comes in i

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,760
fill in the gaps and i help people see a

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
way to keep moving on

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
keep climbing and also just have fun

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
with it because there's

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
a lot of fun to be had with coding and i

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
don't want people to forget about that

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
i just fill in the gaps i don't try to

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
cover everything because it you know it

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
would take me forever if i wanted to try

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
to disseminate

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,000
all of my computer science and coding

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,360
knowledge in the perfect

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,079
way i just pick bits and pieces

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,519
and help people up that ladder even with

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
the tutorial i gave you today

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
you know what my code probably wasn't

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
perfect and maybe

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,399
you didn't get all the eyeshadow tips

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
and the blending and all of that

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,560
but it actually got you exposed to the

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
subjects in a way that's interesting and

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
engaging

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
and i find that it actually gets people

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
to want to ask

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,880
more questions if it isn't perfect

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
someone might say what if we wanted to

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
do the whole face how would we represent

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
that or

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,040
could we output an image instead of just

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
that text of the array

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
or could we even do the reverse take a

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,000
picture of eyeshadow and turn it into

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
code

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,640
by bringing in more interesting examples

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
there are more complex problems but

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,320
people are more willing to engage and

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,240
will also go deeper with their questions

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
i've helped thousands of people continue

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,600
on their coding journey

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,440
and i plan to keep reaching as many as i

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
can but you know what not everyone's

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
into drag

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
or makeup or my communication style you

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
know my partner i always say everyone's

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,240
different

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,839
and you just have to have something

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
special you could bring to the space

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
but i think all of you have that maybe

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
it's a hobby

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
maybe it's a point of view a specific

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,880
culture or even it could just be a

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279
language that you speak

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,200
and i really want to encourage you to

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
try making some form of content and

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
bringing

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
yourself into it and it doesn't have to

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839
be what

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,519
a standard coding tutorial looks like

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
it could be a 30 second tick tock about

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,160
your favorite javascript framework or

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,399
a drawing of different web tools working

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,800
together and post that on instagram

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,920
we've seen plenty of existing tutorials

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,480
i know i've gone through

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,160
so many and it's really easy to think

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,399
that they have to be a certain way

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,440
but really you could do it however you

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,680
want

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
my drag is pretty different than most

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,839
drag a lot of drag queens will go into a

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
bar

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,639
lip sync but i make coding tutorials

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
and i don't even do those in the

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,079
traditional way

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,839
at its root drag is subversive and i've

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
taken that into my technical content

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,800
creation too

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,720
so i really want you to see that your

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,639
uniqueness can connect with people and

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
encourage them to feel welcome

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,880
and unintimidated by coding

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
also selfishly doing the work to put

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,240
together some kind of content

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
really forces you to dive deeper and

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,399
understand the nuances and explain it

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
well this is really valuable if you're

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,240
looking for some leadership

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
opportunities

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,399
at your job um because if you could

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,839
teach someone something that's a really

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,480
valuable skill

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
to me though i'm just sharing how i see

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
the world

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
i'm not even teaching anything that

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,440
complex i look at my eyeshadow palettes

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,240
and i just

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,279
see arrays and i want to open people's

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,279
eyes up

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
you know i've been coding for a decade

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,560
i've been working as an engineer for

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,160
about six years and

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,880
i've been creating this content as

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,360
analytical for two and a half

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,040
and i really think i learned the most

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
from making this content

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,720
it's taught me to be a better engineer

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,800
better communicator and has given me

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
incredible opportunities

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
like being able to give the keynote at

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
this worldwide

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:08,720
javascript conference and talk about

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,720
