Description: 
	Security signals are critically important to ensure the quality and stability of code, especially in production environments (or in CI/CD pipelines). A lack of visibility into security weaknesses in code can represent a significant threat. Wouldnâ€™t you want to know about potential security flaws in your code as early as possible?
While tooling in various areas flourishes, from static code analysis to unit and functional testing, security frameworks often have been limited to subject matter experts, rarely used by developer and QA teams and audits, if at all, run at the very end of the software development lifecycle. With the shift-left spirit we believe this has to change. Adding security checks early to your pipeline can save time and brings awareness and exposure of vulnerabilities to developers which ultimately is the silver bullet for security in your company.
In this session, Justin Dolly, Chief Security Officer, and Christian Bromann, Staff Software Engineer of the Open Source Program Office at Sauce Labs, will give exclusive insights on a new platform and a new set of tools designed to test the security of your applications in a simple, effective and very accessible way.
