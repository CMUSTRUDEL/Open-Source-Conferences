Description: 
	The goal of DevOps has stayed the same, but our tools, infrastructure, and operating models have changed. To support modern software delivery, itâ€™s critical for organizations to establish and share proven developer workflows. This talk will cover how existing projects are using GitHub Action with the hope that all projects despite their size can benefit collectively from knowledge sharing. The benefit of Actions is that the majority are open source. Plan to this talk leave with ideas on how you can automate new portions of your software development workflow and gain insight from open-source projects by peaking into their actions folder. To name a few, Octokit, Babel, and Next.js.
