	Keynote: Breaking Transmission Chains with JavaScript - Cian Ó Maidín, President and Founder, Nearform

One of the greatest responses to COVID-19 has been technological. The brightest minds in the technology industry came together to create a new system to digitally track the virus at a scale, while respecting people’s privacy.

In 2020, NearForm developed what is now the most widely adopted COVID-19 Exposure Notification app in the world. Over five months, the team deployed and scaled their digital contact tracing solution for nine governments.

In this talk, Cian will share the challenges of building an app for all, the importance of getting it right from the start, while working to tight deadlines against an ever evolving pandemic. Cian will discuss how NearForm used an open source approach to public health to help break chains of transmission and save lives using JavaScript.

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,840
project for a number of years now

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,840
notification app in the world

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,159
uh last year um it's pretty uh

career

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,880
so before i jump into it i'd like to

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,000
give you a little bit of my own story

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,799
so at the end of february of january

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
last year

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
uh i went on a business trip to london

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,479
uh three-day business trip

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,679
and uh uh on the way there just before i

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
arrived at my hotel

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
um having gone through heathrow and uh

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,840
dublin airport on the way

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
uh it started to feel like i had some

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,040
some kind of thing stuck in my throat

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,959
um i started to feel a little bit unwell

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
uh but i you know met the team we went

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
out

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,160
had dinner uh got back to the hotel

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,840
um and uh the next couple of days i i

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
kind of had to drag myself around the

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,720
place

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,519
a little bit i was i felt like i had

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,160
some kind of sickness um

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,080
but it wasn't too bad uh but really had

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,360
to like look after my energy levels

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
uh get through things and uh

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
just about made it through the final the

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
third day uh on my trip

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,959
and then i got on a plane came back to

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,000
ireland and got home to my

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,959
my young family um

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,760
and uh as as much as i tried to be uh

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
upbeat and

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,519
and full of energy coming home i really

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,319
didn't feel that well so

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
um that weekend uh i started to get a

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,159
fever

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,480
um i developed a really bad cough

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
um and it was a cough which was bad to

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
the point of

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,159
uh almost vomiting from um the kind of

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,959
coughing that i was doing

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
and uh and so eventually on sunday i

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,560
went to

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,640
to go and see the doctor um and and and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
you know the night before i'd been

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,599
in bed kind of looking at some of this

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
stuff they were talking about a pandemic

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
coming out of china and

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,239
all these things happening in the news

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
so i was kind of thinking in the back of

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,200
my head i couldn't have

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
like this this covert thing that they're

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
talking about i went to doctor and the

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
doctor examined me

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and he said you have a chest infection

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,239
and you have a flu

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,440
uh which was kind of an unusual

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
combination of things

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,799
um so he gave me some antibiotics and

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
other things that didn't do any good for

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,120
me at all

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,319
i went home um and i got into bed and uh

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,040
i was really really sick um at a high

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
fever

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
um i had shortness of breath and wheezed

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
for the first time my entire life

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
uh i just felt really really crummy um

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
the interesting thing is my wife also

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
got sick that week

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
and she went to the doctor and the

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
doctor said to her you have a chest

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
infection and a flu and gave her more

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
antibiotics and things that didn't do

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
very much for her she wasn't too bad

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
with it but i was i was pretty sick so

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
um i really struggled over the next

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,199
three or four weeks to try and

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
uh get back to work um found that i

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,960
wasn't

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,479
like i go back to work for a couple of

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
days then they'd end up back in bed

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
again

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,360
um so it really took me like about five

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,160
weeks to get over it

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
um the funny thing is that um you know

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
during the first week that i spent in

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,080
bed

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
um i was i spent more time reading about

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
this like this new virus that they were

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,000
talking about and maybe there's going to

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
be a pandemic

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
and all that stuff and i said to my wife

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
that there's a pandemic coming and

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
and she she was like laughing at me

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
saying like you know don't believe

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
everything you see on the internet

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,199
all that good stuff um but like

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
ultimately i was proven to be right

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,520
and uh and things got pretty uh

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,520
scary in the world um you know in

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,800
february and march of last year

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
um i guess i characterize how things

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
were

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,440
uh for me anyway i i felt like for

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,919
somebody that's really tried to

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,759
take control of my life and i made

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,560
things happen that this external event

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
had happened and

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,160
i just felt really powerless like there

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
was nothing i could particularly do to

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
to make a difference to what was going

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,120
on in the world and uh everyone else

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,120
i'm sure felt the same way um so they

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,479
declared a pandemic eventually

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
um you know we watched horror uh

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,520
what was going on in italy in march of

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
last year

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
uh and the irish government then were

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
going to lock down the country

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
you know the shops run out of toilet

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,600
rolls they ran out of flour

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
uh everybody was really really scared

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,400
and

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
and uh in ireland they canceled the st

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
patrick's day parade for the first time

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
which is

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,319
it's pretty crazy like um so anyway

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
the weekend of uh after st patrick's day

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,720
parade i got a call

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
from uh a man who works for the health

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
service executive in ireland

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,000
um asking if i could uh potentially help

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,120
the health service executive to build an

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,919
app to help to deal with the pandemic

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
and and of course i was i wanted to do

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,520
what i could do

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
um i called up some of the team here on

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,840
a sunday night

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,039
they started like to gather requirements

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,919
together

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,639
and we started prototyping uh what an

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,240
app would look like

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,400
and uh and so uh

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,600
we um we started to put it together uh

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,919
and uh and we started building what what

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,120
ended up becoming uh the kova tracker

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,000
app

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,000
um so um

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,479
so i guess the the things that i would

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,440
say around building the cover tracker

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,880
uh that are important would would be

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
like that

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
in terms of building the app uh there

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
were some core principles that we

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
discussed at the very beginning

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,240
um one was empowering people

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,160
uh we felt that an app that just did

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
exposure notifications and exposure

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,680
notifications are when you're

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
when you're in proximity to somebody

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,160
else for a number of minutes

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,520
uh typically uh six foot proximity for

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,639
15 minutes

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,919
um uh if one if the person

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,840
you you have the app the other person

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280
with the app the exchange bluetooth key

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,120
and one person gets infected and the

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,880
other person gets told about it

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
we felt that just having that

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
functionality within an app itself

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
wouldn't be enough to keep people

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
engaged and so

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
we thought about how can we empower

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
people so we put in like a check-in

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,879
daily check-in function to the app

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
a symptom tracker and then also some

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,080
data on what's happening around

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,160
infections in your local area

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
um we knew that the app needed to be

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
privacy first and privacy protecting

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
that was the most important thing

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
because

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
if people don't trust the technology

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
they're not going to download it they're

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
not going to install it

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
uh so we made sure that everything uh

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
within the app was optional

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
it was really clearly labeled um we knew

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
uh transparency was going to be really

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
really important

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
uh around how the app was being built

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,080
and what all the things in it meant and

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
um because because people and you know a

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,360
lot of people don't trust technology

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,879
um and so the final thing then was that

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
it would be easy to use that would cater

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,599
from people who were

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,479
you know from 15 to 85 years of age

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,240
so we started working on this um we

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,039
built uh from that sunday night

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
uh ten days later on wednesday the first

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
of april

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,519
uh we had a working version of uh

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,200
what is now the cover tracker app uh it

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
had a custom bluetooth stack that we

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
developed because there

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,160
didn't exist at the time any official uh

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,200
uh exposure notification api from google

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
and apple

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,680
um so a couple of weeks later

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
uh apple and google announced uh they

00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,839
were releasing the exposure notification

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,959
api

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,399
for ios and android um and

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,839
and then a decision was made pretty

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,680
quickly that we were going to like not

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,440
use our our homegrown

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,959
bluetooth stack and we're going to adopt

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,560
this so we had to go and rebuild this

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,279
thing we had to

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
retest it and we did that during may and

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,440
june

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,279
off of the year um

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
we also had to do things like that

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,440
multi-language support

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
um we did like accelerated behavioral

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
studies so we really looked at the

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
language in the app

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
uh you know things like you know uh when

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
i download the app only protecting

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
myself am i protecting others like what

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,360
what are the best ways to describe

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,560
things what are going to get people

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
uh to use the app um

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,080
we worked with accessibility groups in

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
advance of launch and then the big

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
things

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
uh the really big things uh were

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,480
the people working for the health

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
service executive in ireland produced a

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
data protection impact assessment which

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
is a human readable document that

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
described everything going on with the

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,160
app all the data that was traveling

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,399
around

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
uh what the impact was and that was that

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
was published three weeks before the

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
launch of the app

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,360
um and also with that then we we also

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
published the source code for the app

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,040
three weeks before the launch and these

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,800
really important things

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,680
so uh so you know uh the cover tracker

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
app was born

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
um there's a couple of screenshots here

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
you have

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
uh the login screen on the the front

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,160
page screen on the very left hand side

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,279
here you get some uh information about

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
the number of people that checked in

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
today

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
how many are feeling good how many have

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,640
some symptoms

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
what's happening nationally you can

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
click into that uh

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
and various other things and then

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
there's some of the other pieces off

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
some other screens about the setup and

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,200
registration of the app

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
uh how many people have downloaded it

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,920
and uh

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
and what happens if you get a close

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,480
contact and and so the app was launched

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,480
we did a soft launch on the 6th of july

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,560
and within a day or so

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,640
the app really took off uh so we ended

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
up with like over 20 million api calls

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,839
per day

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:12,160
uh on aws uh really really quickly

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,320
um so when the app launched on

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
uh eventually i think some of the tweets

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,640
that people sent out were really nice

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
uh you know is someone talking about the

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,959
data protection

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,560
uh you know the impact uh protection

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,040
impact information is written in

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
plain english uh people can opt in and

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
opt out

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
and it doesn't access your file camera

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,800
et cetera this is really important stuff

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
um also that the app was written in

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,360
react native

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,920
and typescript um and uh the code is

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,279
available on github under mit license

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,320
and that's really important to people

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,040
who can

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
uh i can see what's going on and i want

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
to trust it

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,639
so the minister for health in ireland

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,320
stephen donnelly uh launched the app

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,519
uh formerly on july 7th um

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,519
actually turns out it was my birthday

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,440
that day uh

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,000
and uh and it was a huge success um

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,600
so the plan had been that that uh it was

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
going to be a soft launch for the first

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
week see how it goes and then there was

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,320
going to be a big pr campaign

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,839
and on july the 7th um

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,560
ireland really stood up that day and

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,079
everybody got behind the app people are

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,519
talking about it on the radio

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,000
on television on social media

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
and uh lots of celebrities different

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
people got behind it and they were like

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,800
we need to do this we

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
and i think a lot of the work and the

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
behavioral studies and the messaging was

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,959
really important this is about

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
protecting each other and standing up

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,720
together to to be

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
coveted and so um we ended up having

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
more than a million people

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
uh started using the app in the first 24

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
hours

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,000
uh from launch um and it was

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,279
it was a huge success um

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,959
so scaling um so

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,240
once we had launched the app and we were

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
well we were getting close to launching

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
the app

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,399
a number of other governments started

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
talking to us um because

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,880
uh you know all the health departments

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,839
talk to each other um and uh word was

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,440
going around that we were doing

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,240
something the right way

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
um so we started really thinking at this

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
stage about well how can we

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,800
focus on rolling out this technology as

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,560
quickly as possible like we really

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,480
wanted to respond

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,079
uh to the need that was happening out

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,120
there in the shortest amount of time

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,440
that we could

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
uh you know making making the project

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
open source

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,160
uh was a really uh really important part

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,240
um of uh of the approach um

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,399
everyone can download it any government

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,000
can download it use it for free

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,760
um and uh you know

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,079
um it just made a lot of sense to people

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,600
um so in particular once the first

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,440
government had actually built this thing

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
and rolled it out and tested it then

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
being able to access all the work and

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,000
all all the

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
uh you know the the backing of all that

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
work that had gone into it

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,279
um you know made a lot of sense for

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,760
somebody else that wanted to pick it up

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
or

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,279
versus like build something from scratch

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,880
um the other thing was that we

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,880
we really weren't in this to make money

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,120
so uh the cost per system

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
after the first one was about 25 percent

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
the original implementation so really we

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,079
were just trying to

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
customize uh the work that had already

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
been done

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,880
uh and get people up and running as

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,959
quickly as possible and um

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,959
and the other piece is that the you know

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,320
each implementation like added to the

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,839
strength of the overall open source

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
project

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,800
so um you know features that that are

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,240
or things that uh one government one

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
jurisdiction might need

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,399
uh would get committed to the project uh

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,760
and go back into the master branch and

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
then the other governments would get to

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,720
access that and and get a benefit from

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
it so

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
there's a really good test case for open

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,519
source um

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,120
kind of proud moment for us uh you know

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,079
in the middle of doing all this rollout

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,000
was that

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,279
uh we started getting some traction in

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,199
europe um

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,079
with the the project um and then uh we

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
started getting

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
uh some initial conversations going in

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
the united states and

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,880
and so it became important for us to put

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,680
the the project into a neutral

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
uh repository so we created this project

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,199
with the hse

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,399
uh called a covert green uh it's green

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,440
for ireland

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,160
uh and it's also uh green for the map

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
turning green again uh as kova

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,240
disappears

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,639
um so we put it into linux foundation

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,839
and

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
um and from there then uh things really

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,920
started to roll

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,120
so uh we launched the app in ireland uh

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
in north of ireland

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,360
in scotland uh in gibraltar

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,720
and then in delaware pennsylvania

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,759
new york new jersey uh

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,480
and and jersey uh in the uh

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,959
part of the uh commonwealth um

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,800
and finally um new zealand actually

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,480
launched using the source code without

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
without us needing to help them

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,360
uh near the end of the year last year

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,959
so the highlights of the project um

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
for me the the highlights of this

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,120
project uh

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,079
were like the the the nature of what we

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
achieved in this

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,839
in a short amount of time so you know we

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
managed to do all this

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,120
uh a team of no more than about 15

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,720
people work in

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,199
form uh managed to you know

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
take the first call on the 22nd of march

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
and uh

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
by 26 weeks later we did our last

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,759
deployment which was

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,680
uh new jersey uh

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,519
so you know we got on it we solved the

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,959
problem we worked really closely with

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,680
government and

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,199
um we created this open source project

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,160
and then we did this rollout all over

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,079
the place

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
uh to many governments in a really short

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,279
space of time and

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,160
um it's a big uh big big career

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
highlight for me

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,279
and be proud of all the people at air

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,320
forum for managing to

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,480
to make this happen um

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,920
you know in ireland we got about 40 to

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,079
the adult population were using the

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,280
cover tracker at this height

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,280
um which is pretty impressive

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,319
and uh the app itself uh saved lives

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,880
uh significant number of lives and uh

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,480
reduced a lot prevented a lot of people

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
from getting sick

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,400
um and the other thing is that ireland

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
and the north of ireland

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
so north of ireland were a second

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
rollout uh they were the first two

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
countries

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,880
at the first tube health uh services in

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,679
the world

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
uh to interoperate and have like a

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,760
common

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,120
uh format um where people could use the

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
app in the north of ireland north of

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,160
ireland

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,520
up and come down south and it would work

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,960
perfectly well

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,480
um in summary um

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
i'd like to think that we're we're going

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,799
to be much more well prepared for the

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,200
next pandemic

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,960
lots of learnings lots of uh lots of

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,160
assets in place now

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,039
um infrastructure like cover green

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
uh and things like this i really think

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
that it's perfect

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
it's a perfect use case for open source

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,520
uh

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,280
and and infrastructure like this should

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
be in the public domain like you know

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,799
problems that we have in one country

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,000
that we have to address by and large are

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
the same as the problems we have in

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,960
other countries

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,280
um and the open source approach

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
uh itself has has done some really

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,799
interesting things it's created a lot of

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
new connections

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,880
so you know the work we've done has

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,440
managed to create a a network between 10

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,600
10 different health health uh bodies

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,200
from ireland to pennsylvania

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,679
uh whereby uh over time we'd like to

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
like

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,160
make this into a bigger thing and we'd

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
like to get more health health um

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,799
bodies talking to each other and

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
innovating and sharing what they're

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,080
learning sharing what they're creating

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,960
and that can only be a good thing um

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,799
so um yeah i hope you found this talk

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,400
informative uh

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,919
it's been a real pleasure to get to work

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
on something like this

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
uh i really like to thank uh everyone at

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
near form

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,360
um later on in the conference a number

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,679
of near farmers are going to talk about

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,039
uh that the actually the building of the

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
technology the operating of the

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,799
