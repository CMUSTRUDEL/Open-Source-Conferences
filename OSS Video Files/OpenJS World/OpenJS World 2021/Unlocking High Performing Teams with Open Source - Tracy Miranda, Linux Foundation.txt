Title: Unlocking High Performing Teams with Open Source - Tracy Miranda, Linux Foundation
Publication date: 2021-05-28
Playlist: OpenJS World 2021
Description: 
	The Open Source software community has inspired a legion of users and developers that have taken the idea to incredible heights. That's not entirely unique to Open Source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups, user groups and even entire conferences. What can we learn from this community? By now, most of the IT community has read the “Accelerate State of DevOps” report from DORA and Google. It reveals data and benchmarks about the performance for which all companies aspire to achieve. For example, elite performers are 1.75x more likely to make extensive use of Open Source Software and are 1.5x more likely to be expanding their use of Open Source Software. But how do we get to high performance? In this talk, I will share how Open Source is the key to unlocking high performance using DORA metrics as a roadmap to achievement. I will share steps in a process such as the adoption of continuous improvement programs, identification of unique constraints, and discovering where you can swarm resources to solve the most critical challenges first.

hello everybody

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,839
it is my pleasure to be speaking to you

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
today at openjs world

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,280
and i'll be talking about unlocking high

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,599
performing teams with open source

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
so let me first start by introducing

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,880
myself

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,800
my name is tracy miranda i'm the

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
executive director at the continuous

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,119
delivery foundation

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
and the recurring theme in my career has

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,680
always been

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,279
open source so i've worked with the

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,599
jenkins community

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
and before that was heavily involved in

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
the eclipse

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,800
open source community so in short

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,120
suffice to say i love open source

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,680
and communities so for today

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,840
uh we'll be answering the question what

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,320
does it mean to be a high-performing

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,239
team

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,239
and really what what does it take

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,920
so to as a starting point to answer that

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,520
i'm going to start with the proposition

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
that today

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
every business is a software business or

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,600
at least is

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
under tremendous pressure to transform

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
itself

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,000
into a technology organization

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,240
and continuous delivery is key to this

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
so delivering new software features

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
faster

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
while making sure that your services are

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,600
solid and secure

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
is the key differentiator for almost

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
every business today

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,119
and so we can think about continuous

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,640
delivery as being critical to how

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,640
teams deliver value

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,240
so when we think about those benefits to

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
an organization

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
picture an organization that can deliver

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
new features

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
faster than its competition

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
or picture an organization that can

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
pivot to respond to

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,320
industry and world events

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
or picture an organization that can take

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,280
advantage of fast feedback to build a

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
deep relationship with its users

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
so these are some of the benefits of

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,799
continuous delivery

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
and it's not just at the organizational

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,280
level

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,440
it also helps a lot with your processes

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,640
and with your teens this is my favorite

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,959
part

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
like these processes help create a high

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,680
trust culture

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,720
and most importantly reduce burnout

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,640
which at a time when we have so much to

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
contend with

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,319
it would be really nice if certainly in

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
our professional lives

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
we can do whatever we can to reduce

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,720
stress

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,720
and burnout when it comes to delivering

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,200
software

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,040
okay so what is continuous delivery

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
it's essentially a software development

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,239
practice in which teams release

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,360
software changes to users safely

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,160
quickly and sustainably

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
i'll talk about a little bit more um how

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,879
this has

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,959
changed recently we have been delivering

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
software for a long time

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
um but the rise of microservices and

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,000
cloud native architectures

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,040
has caused a corollary rise in

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,720
continuous delivery practices

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,599
and continuous delivery includes

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,480
the practice of continuous integration

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,239
which is

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,000
as many of you may be familiar the

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,120
practice of merging all developer

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
working copies

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
to a shared main line several times a

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
day

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,840
and before we go further in looking at

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,480
this i want to

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,360
um position three things that are often

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
used in a

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
slightly interchangeable and confusing

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,040
manner especially if you're new to the

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
space you will often hear people talk

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,599
about

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,840
agile and then continuous delivery or ci

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,080
and devops while there is overlap each

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,840
one tends to have a distinct focus

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,120
so for instance agile is focused on

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,560
processes and yeah hot tip to

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,519
this great uh blog post from

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,480
synopsis.com

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
um and then when it comes to devops

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
devops is an organizational and cultural

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
movement that aims to increase

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
continuous delivery

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
um so as a result it will focus on

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,880
culture

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,040
and then continuous delivery uh focuses

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,080
on the tools and automation

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,360
almost seeing that as a way to drive

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
culture change so we have seen uh

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
in specific cases you have great tools

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
can really

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,880
be um that point that helps

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
um push your your team's culture in in

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
the right direction

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
and so for the rest of the talk i'll be

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,320
talking from that perspective of

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,479
kind of tools as that basis for

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,040
for driving change around software

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,040
delivery

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,160
okay so um i saw every talk by telling

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
everyone how lucky we are in this day

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,479
and age

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
when we're delivering more software than

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,560
ever that we have this incredible

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,160
research um around what it takes to

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,240
build and scale high performing

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,600
technology organizations

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,680
and this comes from the accelerate book

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,759
which if you have not checked it out i

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,919
highly highly recommend it

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
written by nicole fosgren jess humble

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,840
and genie kim

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
and it's a partner companion to the

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
state of devops

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
reports which they run for a few years

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
as well

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
and my favorite quote from that whole

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
book

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,720
is from nicole where software delivery

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,880
is an exercise in continuous improvement

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,280
and our research shows that year over

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
year the best keep getting better and

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
those who fail to improve fall further

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,840
and further behind

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
so yeah newsflash standing still is just

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,520
not an option

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
in when it comes to modern technology

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
development

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,160
so um but the book then goes on to

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,720
break down what it does take to build

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,680
and scale your organization in this way

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
and these are in the form of 24 specific

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
capabilities

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,560
to drive improvement

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
so that's a lot of things to to manage

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
all at the same time

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
but i want to focus in on the first

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,479
eight

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
so numbers one to eight over on on one

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,000
side and

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,400
these are specifically uh what we call

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,039
the continuous delivery capability

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,800
so pulling together version control

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
automated deployment continuous

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
integration security

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
this all come together to to form a

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
fundamental basis

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,080
of improving how your team can be

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,720
high performing

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
and as you're making improvements in

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
this space

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
um the other thing well spent spells out

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
is

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,400
how you go about measuring your success

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,120
to see

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,479
what your how to track your progress so

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,599
the book talks about

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,639
um the four metrics so two on

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
speed and two and stability um unlike

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
other

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,800
metrics these are super important

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
because

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
you know they not only kind of fall in

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,199
this domain

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,599
of like i.t metrics uh but they are also

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
business metrics and this kind of

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,479
peer-reviewed research has shown that

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
they correlate

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,360
uh with high-performing teams and good

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,080
business outcomes

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,039
so on the speed side it talks about how

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,880
frequently

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,960
is your team deploying software is it

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,360
daily weekly monthly yearly

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
um and then what is your lead time um

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
from the time you push to

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
that change gets to production so those

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,319
are your two speed measures

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,280
and then when it comes to stability

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
um you can think about it as you know

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
how many

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
failures are you having per the number

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
of deployments

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,280
and then secondly how long does it take

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
you to restore services so

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,520
uh what is that time it will take you to

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,520
recover when something goes wrong

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,479
so um we have

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
this great book accelerate and we have

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,560
all these amazing benefits so we kind of

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,120
know

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
the why and we know the how of

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,919
continuous delivery

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,360
but adoption is still

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,279
not as widespread as you might think

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,360
and that's where we have the continuous

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,800
delivery foundation coming in

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,959
so there's about three things

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,919
um the way i see that prevents people

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,080
from

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
uh being as far down in their software

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
delivery journey as they'd like

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,880
so one is this rise of microservices and

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,120
cloud native technologies

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
it's an amazing game changer it allows

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
us to scale

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,959
incredibly but at the same time it's a

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,880
completely different paradigm

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
of you know lots of environments

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
distributed

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
um code bases and it leaves teams with a

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
lot to compa

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
contend with you know it's just an

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,560
explosion of environments

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,600
um and that that has in turn also led to

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,760
a lot of tools emerging in this place

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
so it's a very fragmented landscape it's

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
very difficult

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,320
um to figure out how to put together an

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,440
end-to-end solution

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,160
and finally change is hard

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,120
we all have limited amounts of change

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
that as people

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
or as organizations we can do all at the

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,200
same time

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,600
so it's very tricky to to kind of evolve

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
our tooling and get away from technical

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
depth

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
so in response to these kind of

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
challenges the continuous delivery

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
foundation

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,560
was set up back in 2019

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,240
partly to nurture open source projects

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,839
and i'll talk a little bit more about

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
these later

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
but in general we see us as having this

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
wider mission of

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
we want to improve the world's capacity

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,160
to deliver software

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,079
with security and speed

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,399
and there's a saying we have in

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,440
technology that the future is here

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
it's just not evenly distributed and

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
this is

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
definitely the case in when it comes to

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,279
software delivery

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,360
but what we have seen is we believe the

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,880
power of open source collaboration and

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,279
use of technology

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,680
can incredibly help level the playing

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,000
field and make it easier for folks to

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,000
to get better and better in this way

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
so today i want to talk to you about

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,240
three ways the continuous delivery

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,880
foundation is approaching

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,800
uh helping the industry and helping

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
people who want to go on this journey to

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,880
becoming

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
high-performing teams

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,640
so the first thing is around driving

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
continuous delivery

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,000
and adoption and we approach this with a

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
number of different initiatives

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
so we have a continuous delivery

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,680
landscape

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,920
uh for any of you folks who are familiar

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,519
with uh like the cloud native computing

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,240
foundation

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
they have this amazing the cncf

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,079
landscape

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,040
also sort of known as healthscape and

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,880
in the most affectionate way but what

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,200
we're trying to do

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,519
here is zoom in specifically on software

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
delivery technologies

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
sometimes we fall into this trap of

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,560
thinking it's ci

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,600
and cd so it's just integration and

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,200
deployment

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,880
when really there is a lot more to it

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
to deliver software you need to get your

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,279
testing right you need to

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,360
um have potential analytics and

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
monitoring and security is super

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
important

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,720
so the idea here um with this we're

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
putting together this landscape to try

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
and give people

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,120
first a high level view of all the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,160
different options in the space

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,240
open source or not and and this is

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,440
all open to contributions so if you see

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,040
a tool missing

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
please do some a pull request

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
so another initiative i want to touch

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
upon is that we have

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
an end user council uh these are for

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
folks

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,720
who are working at organizations who use

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,240
uh continuous delivery solutions are

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,279
trying to put together end-to-end

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,440
solutions

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:31,360
and making them work for their use cases

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,600
so they me the group meets monthly to

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
have these in-depth focused discussions

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
on specific topics

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
so for example we have a lot of folks

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
from the fintech space

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
and they will meet to you know talk

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,480
about the specific governance and

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,639
compliance regulations they need to meet

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,560
with their software pipelines

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
but we also have wider discussions

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,519
around developer productivity

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,279
or measuring success and you're also

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
looking to help drive the direction of

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
tool development so

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
the people who are using the tool can

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
give feedback to the people who are

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,800
creating the tools

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
and one thing you'll see on our website

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,480
is that group has put together

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,880
an interest of council plan where they

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
also map out an editorial calendar

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
of the key topics that everybody sort of

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,160
agreed on

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
hey these are things we want to have

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,040
deeper discussions we want to spend time

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
on it it's not

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,959
like the in-depth discussions and it

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,880
will take time to sort of

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,480
work out what we're doing compare notes

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,519
with other people in the industry and

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
also figure out

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,639
where we should be improving so you can

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,720
take a look at some of the resources

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
coming out of that group on our website

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,519
so going back to um the three areas i'm

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
highlighting

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,079
the second one is around open source

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,199
projects in this space

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,360
so the cdf launched uh with four

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:59,600
key projects um jenkins

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,279
which i'm sure many of you have heard of

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,880
and have used

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,680
as used by practically everybody

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
in different ways then we've also got

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,959
spinnaker which

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,240
is the incredible technology that came

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,519
out of

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
netflix and then we have the newer

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040
projects

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,000
uh in the cloud native space and i like

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,199
to look at it

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,600
this way from an adoption perspective

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,240
so a lot of folks are using jenkins and

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
have been

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
for many years um and spinnaker has also

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
got

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,720
some uh great adoption um and then on

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,959
the other hand as we have

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,279
cloud native technologies and more

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,320
people moving over to microservices

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,839
we have um projects like jenkins x

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,199
and tachton which are focused on

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,399
um building on kubernetes

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,959
and providing options um for how you can

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,000
build

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,839
your ci cd pipelines and have them you

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,560
know

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,760
uh just with a lot of scalability

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,959
and you know taking full advantage of

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,320
all the benefits of being in a

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
distributed environment

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,000
and one of the ways we like to think

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,079
about our open source projects so

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,160
like we have them at every end of the

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,320
adoption curve

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,600
but we also try to push our projects to

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,199
help tie to these best practices or to

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,279
these capabilities

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
because when we look at the list of you

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
know things

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
that the research says we need to get

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,120
better at there's a lot of things on

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
that list

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,959
and we have to ask ourselves

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
is this something that software tools

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,360
can help us with

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
like tools won't solve all your problems

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
and they're certainly

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
not going to bring around changing your

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,399
culture or making your team better

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,480
but are there some things we can trust

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,839
to tools so that we can focus

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,959
um on the harder things that take uh

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,279
longer to to bring about change

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
and i would argue yes um there's a whole

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,800
set of things

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
where if we can have tools that are kind

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,639
of lend ourselves to more

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
opinionated workflows they can set us

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,160
off on this golden path

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,680
so in particular with tools like jenkins

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
x and tacton

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,360
um we're really looking at it that way

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
of saying

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
can we set out with these tools that

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,680
encourage best practices

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,680
by default

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,880
okay so moving on to the third point

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,639
um as we talked about general continuous

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,240
delivery adoption second we talk about

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
projects

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,160
but the third side i like to see as the

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
the community side

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
so what can we do to make this

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,240
continuous improvement journey

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,600
easier i talked about earlier change

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,399
being hard

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,800
and we're always looking for ways to

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
make

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,279
easier for people to bring about that

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,240
change in the organization

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,240
and have other folks to talk over some

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,520
of their decisions and choices and see

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,000
if they're on the right path

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,079
and one of the other ways we like to

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,160
approach this is saying

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,360
how can we simplify things for the whole

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,799
industry

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,319
how can we make solutions easier

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,039
especially when it comes to this

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,559
explosion of tools and choices

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,039
and there's a strong set of folks who

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,839
share

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,319
this idea that we need to promote

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,919
interoperability

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,160
we need to have standardized building

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,039
blocks we shouldn't be reinventing the

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
wheel

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,640
and we should really drive for common

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,039
apis and metadata

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,160
and that will kind of improve uh the

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,480
rate of adoption

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,880
and the way the industry can and can

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
adopt end-to-end solutions and beginners

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,520
can get started

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,160
and things like that so to that end one

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
of our most

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
active special interest groups is the

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
sake interoperability

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
it meets every two weeks and we have

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
great conversations where we're trying

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
to bring people together

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,880
trying to find common ground and um

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
it's spinning off quite a few

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
initiatives for for instance

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,640
uh we have a focus group um a special

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
interest group

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,600
on events in ci cd saying okay let's

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,080
standardize how we talk about

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
the events you get from a cd pipeline

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,120
and

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
let's let's see if we can drive for

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,840
different tools to all adopt the same

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
strategy so

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,440
it gives us these building blocks to

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,840
build upon

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,360
and similarly the tacton project uh if

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,600
you take a look at that

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,640
it it's got some great building blocks

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
for anybody looking

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,440
at continuous delivery in a cloud native

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,400
space

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
and one of the other kind of initiatives

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,559
that

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
sort of emerged as super important when

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
we started those discussions in the

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,799
interoperability group

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,320
was this around terminology even as you

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
get started and you start

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,760
moving between different tools or

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,520
looking at different tools you'll find

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
that different tools will use different

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,840
terms for the same thing

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,000
or they'll use a word in a different way

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
and the scope is slightly different

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,760
so we've tried to capture that as well

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
in what we call our rosetta stone for

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,160
continuous delivery

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,000
and it's it's a picture in github which

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,559
it kind of compares and contrasts the

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,960
terms and it tries to drive some clarity

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,880
um around these terms so we can be we

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,799
can make people's life easier

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,280
when they're looking at and evaluating

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,320
different options um for their

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,320
continuous delivery

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
so that was kind of a a whistle-stop

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,320
look at the ways the continuous delivery

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,520
foundation is trying to

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,280
bring about this chain so striving for

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,440
continuous delivery adoption

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,039
promoting and the sustainability of open

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,080
source projects that help with best

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
practices

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
and then just bringing together the

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,760
communities in ways um that we can

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,520
make life better for everybody through

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,280
interoperability

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,039
um so i want to sum up

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
when we asked ourselves in the beginning

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,960
you know what does it mean to be a high

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,880
software delivery team the accelerate

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,720
book spells that out for us

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:18,000
we need to continuously improve

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,840
in these practices and we measure that

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
against how quickly we're deploying

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
software and how safely we're doing it

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and how well we can recover when things

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,159
go wrong

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
while we're trying to make those changes

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,320
uh microservices and cloud native

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
technologies have drastically changed

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
the game

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,880
so we're having to evolve while things

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,320
are changing

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,360
under our feet and change is super hard

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,200
um so something we have to contend with

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,840
but the option for staying still

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
you know doesn't really exist for any

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,280
kind of modern or

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,600
evolving organization

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
but nevertheless open source can come to

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
the rescue

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
so in a couple of ways we can think

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,159
about this

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
one to take a look at open source

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,120
technologies anything from jenkins to

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
techton

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,440
spinnaker and some of our other newer

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,440
projects and these help make the most

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,159
uh important software delivery so you're

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
not reinventing the wheel or maintaining

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,760
software um that already exists out

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
there

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,280
and then secondly just being part of

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
open source communities who

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,640
are undergoing the same journey really

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,640
helps make life easier for everybody

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,320
and in that vein i want to finish it off

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,360
by saying

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,400
after open js world we also have our

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
annual

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,039
event at cd foundation so that is cdcon

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,760
just around the corner

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,600
and if anything i've said today has

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,320
piqued your interest i would say it's

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,200
one of the best places to come meet the

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
community

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,120
we have a lot of interactive sort of

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,840
birds of feather sessions

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,039
as well as talks from experts and people

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,280
doing their best

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,039
on this journey so it's amazing place to

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,919
meet folks

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,120
learn things and also have fun a very

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,840
welcoming community

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,240
so would love to welcome you to join in

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,240
with us

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,280
and i'll leave it there please check out

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
building the future of continuous

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,039
delivery
