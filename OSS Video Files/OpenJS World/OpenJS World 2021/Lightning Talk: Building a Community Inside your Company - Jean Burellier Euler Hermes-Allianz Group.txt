Playlist: OpenJS World 2021
Description: 
	Most of the successful Open Source projects are here today because of a community. From directly contributing to the code or helping others by providing guides and answering questions. We can even considerate it as a standard practice now. But do you have this kind of community inside your company ? Do you have a circle of peers to discuss about technical decisions at a bigger level than just few people ? For most of the companies this community doesn't exist and this group is limited to your team. In this talk I want to present how you can foster this kind of community and how it can greatly improve both the life of all the people and the quality of your IT products
