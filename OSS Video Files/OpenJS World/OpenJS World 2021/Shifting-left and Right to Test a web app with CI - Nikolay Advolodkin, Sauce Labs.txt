Description: 
	Automated testing by a developer is still a topic that is heavily contested. Developers continue to struggle to understand how to test their apps, when to test, and how to put this all together into a continuous integration pipeline. This process can be surprisingly simple with the combination of the right tools. In this live-coding session developers will learn how to create a web-app using React. Afterward, we will shift-left by adding some automated unit tests using Jest. Next, we will shift-right by adding some functional tests using Cypress.io. Finally, the developers will learn how to continuously build and test the web app through a Github workflow. By the end of the session, the developers will: - Learn a bit about unit testing with Jest - Learn Cypress for functional testing - Put all of this together into a CI pipeline that builds and tests in a continuous manner
