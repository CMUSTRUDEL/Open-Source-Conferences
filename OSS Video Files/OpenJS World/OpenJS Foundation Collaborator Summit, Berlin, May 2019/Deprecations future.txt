So far our user experience was partially meh, when it comes to deprecation warnings. We often struggle with deprecations due to our very heterogeneous users. There is often a gap in the requirements for e.g., CLI users, big companies that want the most reliable and safe way doing things, individuals who e.g., write a small script and so on. Most important though: we mainly reach the wrong people when printing our deprecation warnings. In general there are lots of pros and cons with deprecations.

That's why I would like to brainstorm what we could do to:

* reach the right people
* improve the average experience for all users
* still have a good way to improve the Node.js code base

So far I already thought about e.g., using a Node.js survey to gather further data and to figure out what our users actually believe and also about add an option to opt-into providing data when it comes to deprecations or other usage data.

This is very likely not an easy task and I ask not only Node.js collaborators to join but people who e.g., have run into deprecation warnings before, who found them distracting, great, weird and people who have e.g., strict requirements in companies. I believe we need a lot more feedback on this topic! If anyone has a lot of experience in this field, great, please join this session!
