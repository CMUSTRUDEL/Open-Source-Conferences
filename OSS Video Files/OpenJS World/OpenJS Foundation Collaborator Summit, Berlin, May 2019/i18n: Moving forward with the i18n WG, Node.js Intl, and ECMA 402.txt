A breakout session for members of the i18n WG to cover how we can continue to push forward efforts like:

* l10n: CommComm Initiatives for internationalizing the API docs, and the website redesign project.
* Intl in Node.js: How the i18n WG can focus on supporting current Intl development in node core, and get more folks to help out with the core WG.
* The i18n WG's role in ECMA 402: How we can scale the i18n WG's involvement and support for tc39 in ECMA 402, and what the current needs are that Node.js representatives can fulfill for pushing JavaScript's Intl specification forward.
