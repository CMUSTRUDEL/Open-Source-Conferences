	00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,790
all right so we're gonna get started

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,040
with the CPC session in here and then

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,139
deprecations I think is in the other

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,269
room right now

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,710
some of the folks in the CPC are just

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,590
taking a break if I could ask those who

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,350
are participating just to come forward

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,140
to it move a little bit more close to to

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,080
the front so we can simply press

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:31,800
microphones around this is one of the

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:37,140
more interactive sessions that would be

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,399
super and while we're doing that I will

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:59,219
share the good news everyone that we

00:00:41,399 --> 00:01:01,920
merge the agenda so if you are a cheat

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:11,700
is driving usual as crazy as it is me

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:13,950
then hello everyone who's in the room so

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,150
fun no something to think about if you

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,220
haven't read the Charter for the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,520
cross-project Council which is probably

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,290
everyone who didn't raft it the way in

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,979
which lacrosse project council is that I

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,479
mentioned it earlier it's a palace or an

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:28,799
organization so there are some different

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,229
league membership levels so there are

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,259
voting members and voting members are

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,390
made up of elected individuals from the

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,159
various projects and we can get into how

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,590
that is made that there's 15 voting

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,049
members right now there's also the

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,270
concept of regular members which is a

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,159
self nominating process that we're still

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,649
figuring out and then there's observers

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,140
and observers is literally anyone from

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,570
any project within the entire foundation

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,600
an eyelid for the purpose of today's

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,670
meeting if no one objects I'd like to

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,320
extend that to include everyone in the

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,460
room so even if you're not actively

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,829
involved in stuff the way which were our

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,349
governance is set up is that we use

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,520
consensus seeking it's a seeking as if

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,650
process means you

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,260
say an idea and if no one in jakszyk and

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,690
it moves forward the governance for the

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,180
CPC states that any observer can

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,710
participate in consensus seeking so if

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,660
you have problems with something if you

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,790
want to submit an idea you don't

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,140
actually need to be on the council you

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,450
just need to participate in the

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,040
foundation and that was something that

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,080
was very intentional to try to make sure

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,910
that anyone who wants to come and do the

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,140
work can do the work when there isn't

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:47,290
like some sort of arbitrary bar so if

00:02:41,140 --> 00:03:18,190
you have an idea it's not like you need

00:02:47,290 --> 00:03:20,080
to be able to that we can proceed with

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,040
sort of like our ordinary business which

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,980
we certainly have lots from last last

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,130
week to continue over take questions

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,540
from the population here many of whom

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,510
are probably experiencing this for the

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,420
first time and then possibly because

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,110
this is such high value time for us and

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,440
we were having a great conversation

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,870
about this dinner last night organizing

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,900
some breakout sessions on a different

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,240
proposal that we have like right now

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:57,150
like the travel fund and Vanille had a

00:03:49,240 --> 00:04:00,340
good one remember it but does that sound

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:06,250
reasonable Joe I'm looking at you

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:14,260
because all right so we're an airway we

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:17,140
do this on zoo once a week and are we

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:22,020
are assuming we're not live-streaming

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,020
but we are assuming yep yeah

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:33,009
I will navigate over now to the yes sir

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:33,009
I can

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,500
okay for those who are familiar we have

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,690
the OpenGL foundation in homework and

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,569
all of the work group the CVC happens in

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,150
the crafts project council repo the

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,389
agenda items are pulled from the label

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,270
class project council agenda so our

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,490
first item that we have remaining from

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,220
last week is nominating a chair in the

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:21,509
director Jody because I think you were

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:25,080
leading this so I think essentially we

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:28,710
have nominations open for the chair and

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,469
director roles for the project Council

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,500
and the hope was that people would have

00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:38,639
an opportunity at these events that

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,620
collapsed on it not generally here being

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,159
Berlin to get to know each other a

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,099
little bit better

00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:47,039
while nominations are open and then have

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:54,440
voting started after these events and

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:57,659
then how boating conclude was June 1919

00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,699
just a few days before the next board

00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:06,990
meeting and I believe that the is the

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:09,000
process that we are to email nominations

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,620
they're not last lunch operations at

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,050
open JSF or they'll remain private until

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,919
the nomination period is over and then

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,759
when it's closed

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,759
Brian Warner will post all nominations

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,779
any open questions on this issue yes it

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:36,539
might be useful to decant the potential

00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:38,610
candidates showing I just think it might

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,289
be was well if you could go over to the

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,479
list of the voting candidate twenty

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:47,699
members because if people want to go and

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,660
talk to them understand yeah okay so the

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,780
earnings

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,850
see reps from the projects it'll open

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,820
here in just a second

00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,170
these are the folks who are voting

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:04,950
members so from node Matteo and Joe

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,180
David to me Matt Dillon the bottom yep

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,260
because I have a question actually

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,530
related to this I made a mistake and

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,760
reopen this issue nickel leery dropped

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:24,960
out because we thought we had too many

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:27,720
IBM are emily's what handle into an IBM

00:07:24,960 --> 00:08:19,500
slack came up similarly in a similar

00:07:27,720 --> 00:08:21,140
location I was like okay Michael could

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,390
do that sure

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,020
the chair is focused around coordinating

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:31,230
the meetings that take place weekly and

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:34,229
making sure there's an agenda or often

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,660
just pull into you know when there's

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,030
problems tough so it's basically keeping

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:42,719
the business part of things running the

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,070
director acts as a link between CPC and

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,420
the board of directors

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,120
so actually goes to the Board of

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,710
Directors meetings brings back and

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,320
shares what information you can't catch

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,760
everything the store directors you know

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,420
there's some stuff which has to stay

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,770
within that particular group but you

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,480
know come

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,820
represents best that they can what's

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,040
going on where we need inputted there's

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,110
questions data often so for example some

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,720
common things that we have TSC was like

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,370
we have a legal rush ok well then they

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,130
will take that question to the board and

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,920
that passes off to legal committee or we

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,930
want to change some charters previous

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,300
governance the board had to review those

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,250
so while actually maintained order

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,160
things like here's the stuff you need to

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,200
get to get the order to comment on house

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,600
so that's kind of this operation I can

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:36,300
see miles wants to say Michigan sorry so

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,940
with the board rule one of the things to

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,920
keep in mind which is important is like

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,600
being the CPC word rep actually means

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,510
that you're representing at the board

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,279
every single project and that can be

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,570
really confusing because it means

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,660
there's a lot of different hats that you

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,500
wear including your own so there's

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:58,680
actually a fiduciary duty and risk with

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,910
being a board member which is important

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,310
to keep in mind if it's something that

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,680
you want to nominate or eventually work

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,240
towards doing so every single board

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,970
member has a few distribute e to the

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,970
foundation to do it's in the best for

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,649
the foundation itself and you know if

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,630
things were to happen that caused

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,720
financial disaster through the

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:22,200
foundation you could be held liable as

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,850
an individual for that if you are so

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:33,209
that's one minute responsibility that's

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:36,180
good to keep on work yes so the question

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,700
was if there's the foundation has

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:46,560
insurance in place for that liability

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:47,700
and the answer was yes weird stuff if

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,850
you've ever sat on the board of a

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,649
non-profit insurance doesn't cover you

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,529
if you go against the will of the rest

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,899
of the board so you can't just speak out

00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,490
whenever you want on things that would

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,709
risk they like the fiduciary

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,300
responsibilities of any of the

00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,709
individual projects as well right so

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,130
everything that's housed at the

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:11,550
foundation potentially eroding the value

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,190
of those individual projects all

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,600
and since you're representing 31

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,310
different projects and it's very

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,830
possible that those projects don't even

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,500
agree like a really great example would

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,240
be the merger that happened when noted

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,820
first introduced to it not everyone was

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,720
positive and whether or not I was

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,550
personally super Co which it was I had

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,490
to make sure to represent all of those

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:39,510
you points to the board and not just my

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,420
own bias but also a part of that is you

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,800
ultimately have to vote regardless of

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,959
whether all those projects are in

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,750
conflict so part of the responsibility

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,240
is managing expectations around that and

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,880
being careful in your delivery and also

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,890
being driven here like I think that

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:18,060
nuance the thing that a director for an

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:20,370
at-large our next item nominations for

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,829
regular members does anyone in front of

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,310
us you can see want to speak to this

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,529
issue Michael since you are open the

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,029
issue yeah let's just go down to the

00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:34,740
bottom to see if there's I think it's

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:36,360
just a time that anybody who's here and

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,860
who's remember one of the projects I

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,360
think we say is you know to be a member

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,550
for three months I remember correctly

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,620
wants to be part of the CPC as it was

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,820
mentioned earlier it's very open you can

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,770
be an observer but if you want to

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,740
actually say I'm committed under the

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,540
participate regular regularly I think

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,529
now we should just start I think all

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,270
we're waiting for is if there really

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,890
needs to be updated means that we have a

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,290
place to have people start keying our

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,570
CRM self in but if you're interested

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,130
that's the next step just PR yourself in

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,010
saying I want to become like a member

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,680
and as was mentioned you know you get to

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,270
participate with pretty much everything

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:13,500
unless there's conflict and that's when

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,450
the voting immerse they have to me one

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,310
thing they don't want regular members

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,089
participate kids and concepts of seeking

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,610
model of the CPC so essentially they

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,290
vote there versus good to be hurt that's

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,140
that

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:31,050
like on the TSC II saw it where we have

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,670
a similar model it's very rarely have

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,620
folks like I can't remember it's like

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,650
once every two three months or something

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,210
so like Te'o said pretty much most of

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,210
the time you must be participating

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:51,900
alright Scooby so definitely your name

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,330
to the remain APR I'm just going down

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,870
not any particular order new process for

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,820
CPC reps to share responsibility for

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,650
travel fund this is actually one of the

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:10,740
topics too that I'm suggesting we break

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:12,930
out yeah I would like to speak not about

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,800
this but about the PR that I have

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,980
created because this is a bigger issue

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,650
so yes as a travel fund as you probably

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,080
know I mean if you travel here for the

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:28,710
trial with the travel fund

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:33,150
hey thank you folks and yeah that was

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:35,210
that's amazing and the travel fund

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,170
serves the purpose of finially

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,260
individuals that cannot rely on

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,620
corporate sponsors to travel we always

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,510
recommend your employer to fund your

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,970
trouble but that's not usually that's

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,660
not possible not always possible in both

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:55,200
small and large organizations so you can

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,960
even be shelves some thousands of

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,610
dollars for new travel might not be

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,400
something that you can you don't willing

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:07,170
to go out of pocket so is that so as

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,040
part of these they no trouble funds or

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:13,290
two purposes and one is people to come

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,940
to these summits and the next summit and

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:20,370
stuff and also for doing stuff promoting

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,800
note conference and events and

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:30,000
organizing other things so those are two

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:35,040
different roles and I propose decision I

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,680
am proposing to create a team under the

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,589
CPC that these

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,680
for amazing the Sun and that we'll ever

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,589
see on a travel fund for the summit that

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,420
will be available to all projects to

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,370
some extent and these needs to be

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:56,060
defined this is no question so how do

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,060
you break out that fun and and that is

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:07,050
and some questions around all of this so

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,820
it's if you like this event and you want

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,550
to be part of the organization of next

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,700
event of the next coming please get in

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:19,709
touch event organization is a rather

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:22,170
different thing from running but it's as

00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:26,430
important because you know being

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:29,820
together things and things forward

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:34,080
resolve conflicts you know I had a nice

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,640
conversation with with Francis at

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,149
midnight and they were saying that

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:50,310
sharing human beings strange animals and

00:16:39,149 --> 00:17:00,600
sharing a meal together but that was

00:16:50,310 --> 00:17:06,089
pretty much so we are open from me I

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,569
don't remember the number yes it's on

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:22,140
the table

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:24,980
so yes 187 and it's basically that do

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:30,059
you want to have a breakout session with

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:43,890
this week if there are people that are

00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:44,190
willing yes definitely an amazing that's

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,630
it

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,630
Ruby thank you

00:17:48,090 --> 00:18:04,240
okay next agenda initial process for

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:09,730
electing voting members from non impact

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,500
projects so for some context we kind of

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,070
have a chicken and the egg problem where

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,840
we were all impact projects get up to

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,420
two representatives voting

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,640
representatives on the CPC and then we

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,250
elect two more representatives from the

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,030
other categories of project but we have

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:31,630
to sort of like we need to have a group

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:33,970
to adopt the voting process but we you

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,690
know so anyway so we just took everybody

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,460
who self nominated as an initial sort of

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,810
just to get us a bootstrap that going

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:46,720
what we need to actually define what our

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:49,600
like election process looks like for for

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,440
these folks in a more you know regular

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,240
capacity miles do you want to speak to

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,090
this one since you up of these you or

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,800
somebody else so I mean Joey as much as

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,790
you want to talk about it to please feel

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,790
free because it was originally your

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:19,000
process for electing this okay so I

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:20,290
think that for this first pass we kind

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,540
of just said everyone to raise their

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,660
hand because there wasn't too many just

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,870
all became voting members I think it

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,220
also kind of falls in line with like

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,940
voting members or more a rule of

00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,320
responsibility than power in the design

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,270
but we did look at a couple different

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,890
voting platforms that we could use

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:47,380
including Helios and then the other

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:49,030
voting platform is City IDs and there's

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,270
a couple different methods for voting

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,100
that we could use so there's since does

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,450
a method where you kind of spec rank all

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,750
the characters and then behind the

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,430
scenes it figures out who was the most

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,059
voted in them can kind of stack rank

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,219
them

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,989
ah Helios has a couple different ways

00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:07,269
that you can set it up but the way that

00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:09,099
I was suggesting was inspired how the

00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,679
OSI does their election for their board

00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,209
where essentially you get a list of all

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,489
of the candidates and you just check

00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:17,619
next to the ones that you're ok with

00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,659
being so it's not like picking anyone is

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,879
just like hey here all the candidates

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:24,519
that I agree with that it's whoever had

00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:29,589
the most votes of confidence you snap

00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:32,949
right based on that my understanding is

00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:34,839
that we're not in a rush to solve this

00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:37,509
problem right now but it's definitely

00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:40,139
something that we want to codify so that

00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:42,879
when elections come up in the next year

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:46,329
we saw that I guess the only thing that

00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:48,339
we haven't really planned for here I'm

00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,139
not sure if we need to pre optimize for

00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:54,069
it is like what happens when new

00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:55,899
projects join if a new project joins an

00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,629
impact level do they immediately elect

00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,909
their two representatives is that is

00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:02,679
that like kind of a mid election and

00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:05,109
then it happens again at the same

00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,859
election time if new projects join as

00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:10,599
not impact level projects and they're

00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:12,369
really they didn't have the opportunity

00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,609
to raise their hand and participate in

00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:17,499
this what do we want to do so I don't

00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,849
think we need to make decisions now but

00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:22,029
like those are probably things that we

00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:23,619
want to start thinking about so that we

00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:25,959
have an answer for people when they show

00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,579
up instead of kind of dealing with these

00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,739
conflicts but we could also just figure

00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:31,659
it out as we go I think the approach

00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:34,149
that we've taken so far has been like

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:38,889
hyper inclusive I guess another thing to

00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:40,359
keep in mind also we drafted all of this

00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:42,369
governance as part of the construct

00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:47,439
process and it was kind of in a vacuum

00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:49,749
and reality we can change the Charter at

00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,339
any time the CPC treasurer does need to

00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,269
go to the board to be changed and that

00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:55,479
something the director would be

00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,009
responsible for helping to do but if we

00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,119
find it like what's in the Charter

00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:01,149
doesn't fit with the way that we

00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:04,379
actually want to do things we can

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:04,379
augment it as we go

00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,210
one related issue that we should I think

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,050
cancel that at least in the next couple

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:15,540
months or so is when the next or well

00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,290
first elections actually happen because

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,690
going with exactly one year is a really

00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,360
really convenient given that it was work

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,010
like three weeks before now and that

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,290
would suggest that we would end up with

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,620
a surplus aversion us now where people

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,690
who you know get picked have you know

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,820
the police in order to get the travel

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,120
and everything sold it to participate in

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,980
that summon if the we are going to

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,429
follow the past president of how these

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,320
know de asalto so that ends up

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:49,820
interlinking with what do we want to do

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,350
with the future of collapse codes and I

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,790
would appreciate if we ended up with the

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,070
situation where the elections were

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:59,429
happening at least you know a month or a

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,309
couple months apart from any club site I

00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,690
was just gonna add you can even think of

00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,250
you might want to do it the other way so

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,200
that people can get together out the

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,730
collapse of it knowing that they're

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,730
going you know get a better feel for who

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,200
they're going to vote for and so you

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,240
might want to even do them afterwards

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,059
yeah like certainly to figuring out the

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,070
timing is report said so that to me we

00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,280
might end up I mean with the current

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,830
timing that presuming past precedent

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:31,110
follows that the next collapse of it

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:33,860
happens in was a motel in December then

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:37,520
it would make sense for the next

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,900
election to happen for exactly January

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,710
possibly like I guess it's like that's

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,929
even saying or a year from now plus or

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:52,440
minus a few months yeah as I said yeah

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:54,090
but yes different Miami there's one

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,150
thing which you're not gonna find here

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,460
because it's actually in the TSC remote

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,850
but one of the things the CBC doesn't

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,210
need to approve is they updated charter

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,160
for the nodejs community it used to be

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,790
you know basically taking that to the

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,880
board but it's now the CPC that's gonna

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:17,640
be reviewing those charters so I don't

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,029
know how we want to do that here but we

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:29,820
should

00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:46,889
we yeah I think we so it isn't captured

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:49,379
I don't think so

00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:54,599
in the sense that I think it's batter

00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:59,450
for process coordination the not yes TSC

00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:02,909
encanta know adopted an issue on the

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:11,039
cross posit council repo essentially

00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:15,019
it's you know the note is TSC and common

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,019
when they need to change their charters

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:54,450
and then projects so I want to go around

00:25:50,249 --> 00:26:12,960
check things on 31 31 different

00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:15,200
organizations we do need to go through

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,219
the process of chartering all of them

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,809
one of the things that we did discuss

00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:21,539
which I don't think we got in we're

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,190
gonna get into today too much is like we

00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,960
have a process for unlearning new

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,479
projects and Jorian I've been working on

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,179
like a checklist and process Jori

00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:32,659
started the work and

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:34,549
I've been adding a few things but one

00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,859
thing that I think would be good is if

00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,379
all of the projects kind of like dog

00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:41,509
food that process I don't think it's

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,820
fair as a foundation to ask new projects

00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,619
to do things that we ourselves a aren't

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,419
willing to do or be aren't capable of

00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,099
doing so we should really make sure that

00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,349
like the bar that we're setting for new

00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:53,119
projects coming in especially at the

00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,649
various levels of projects are things

00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,359
that the levels of projects that we have

00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:00,499
are doing it's very easy to kind of get

00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,690
brought in just because you were there

00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:04,389
before and then like not really make it

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,249
fair for new people that are coming in

00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:08,889
but part of all of this would be we

00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:12,590
maybe should start the tracking issue

00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:14,629
for like the onboarding of projects

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,159
which includes chartering all of the

00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:18,169
projects which don't have Turner's which

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,330
would probably involve hey maybe we

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,739
should make like a default template of

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,509
what a charter should look like

00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:26,210
that's fill in the blank that makes it

00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:29,450
easy and we could probably take like the

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,309
note charter as a starting place but I

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,539
do think one of the things for other

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:41,389
projects that are here that's good to

00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:43,849
know one of the things that I think is

00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:45,950
important to consider is like note has

00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:47,599
been doing this for you know a couple of

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,789
years now so we have a lot of process in

00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,429
place doesn't mean you have to do it the

00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:55,099
way that we're doing it I think there's

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:57,590
value in kind of a lot of people having

00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:59,720
similar things like especially just not

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,999
not having that recreate everything from

00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,529
first principles but I don't think that

00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:05,149
projects should feel like they have to

00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:06,440
adopt the governance of note to do what

00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,210
they're doing and there are some things

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,279
that are charter that are pretty exact

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,479
one of the big things to keep in mind is

00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,909
the difference between your governance

00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:17,269
and your charter charters are things

00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:19,039
that require other parties to approve of

00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:21,139
for changes whereas the governance is

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,989
something that you can manage yourself I

00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:27,409
see Adam not in a long year because he

00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:29,809
we learned that lesson the hard way but

00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,639
it's like you want to actually have as

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,859
little as possible in the Charter that

00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:36,450
just defines like the goals and mission

00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:38,429
and like defining what you own as

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,590
like the group that is chartered you

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:41,970
whereas like the day-to-day operations

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,309
and things that you may want to like

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:51,960
tweak on a more regular basis of

00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:54,690
evidence document tracing to know what

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,639
you need to have in the Charter versus

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,320
the governance right by bare minimum you

00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:00,359
just look at the Charter at the open

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,509
jazz foundation or ask somebody else

00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:06,210
so like the chairs I think the the

00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,580
representatives of each project should

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,679
probably be aware of like what that

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,450
Charter says just so that you can avoid

00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,279
any hiccups down the road which is

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,519
writing something in your governance

00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,129
that actually requires external support

00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,940
or consensus on even if it's just

00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:25,769
amongst the other projects although to

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,169
the point I was saying a little while

00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,549
ago now that charter changes for

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:32,309
projects will be going through the cross

00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:34,080
project council instead of the board is

00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,149
going to be way easier and a lot of the

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,269
pain that like the note foundation had

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,859
like the situation that we were alluding

00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:43,039
to before was like we did some charter

00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:45,869
changes and then there were some like

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,429
editorial changes that also happened and

00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,679
then everything got mixed in and then it

00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,409
was really hard for the lawyers to

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,149
figure out the difference and then it

00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:57,480
took like four months to do something

00:29:54,149 --> 00:30:00,749
that should have taken like a week so we

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,739
protected against that but yeah if

00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:04,679
anyone needs help with this

00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:08,940
just ask me so I'm gonna move this along

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,220
and suggest that you know again because

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,210
we can take advantage of everyone being

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,369
together in a space that we potentially

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:19,619
if you're interested in writing the

00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:23,419
draft proposal for how we do elections

00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:27,210
which was the original agenda topic and

00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:29,009
or if you're interested in being part of

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,950
a group that helps kind of figure out

00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:35,549
how we write the charters for thirty-one

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,679
ish projects let's do some breakout

00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:40,859
sessions on that because we can we can

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,889
probably get a lot done with just half

00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,480
an hour in brainstorming and all we have

00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:47,849
to do is just get a document with just

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,840
the initial ideas down and then we can

00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:53,650
like

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:58,240
so I want to take advantage of your

00:30:53,650 --> 00:31:01,540
brainpower let's move on to our next

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,020
agenda item which actually I think we

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:14,200
can close this one since we identified

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:32,140
that you then review meeting times would

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:35,730
be the next one we really then that

00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:38,730
means our next CPC meeting will be on

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,730
Monday

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,849
[Music]

00:31:48,840 --> 00:32:01,600
pardon the other sheet to that issue I

00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,170
don't know because I I know there are

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,810
people who have scheduling restraints

00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:10,800
who aren't here

00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:18,480
so should we stick with 8 p.m. on Monday

00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:29,700
for those of us working in an issue I

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:38,350
mean not necessarily sometimes yeah so

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:45,340
the lead on Tuesday is 1600 UTC and then

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:47,980
the lead on Wednesday is also 1600 UTC

00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:51,730
but we were talking about like doing

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,470
alternating as we have been right now we

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,390
we always meet on Mondays but it

00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:00,370
alternates between two different times

00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:02,880
in desert school like in poldi's and

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,880
like show you

00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:09,350
okay recording next week could we just

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:17,600
decide to go for a different thing

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:19,610
Monday today is Thursday yeah we were

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,999
talking about this specifically last

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:25,909
time we ended up talking I think about

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:29,570
alternating between a fool for 1600 and

00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:31,639
1900 UTC on Wednesday so I can't just at

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:59,629
least switch to Wednesday for the day

00:33:31,639 --> 00:34:02,480
and then time okay so we'll stick with

00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:10,309
what we have but I think we should shoot

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:14,270
to address this okay I think that might

00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:17,869
get us through all of the agenda items

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:21,950
in which case we can actually have a

00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:27,379
double check event we have a project

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:30,770
board this board has we have identified

00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:34,329
as work to be conducted post bootstrap

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:36,649
and we have been going through that I

00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:38,750
don't know if we want to do that now or

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:41,929
other concepts where you have 20 minutes

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:52,280
to lunch open up for just any questions

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:54,950
that people have okay so let's just open

00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,319
up the floor for any questions from our

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,250
wonderful group of participants because

00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:03,049
we have lots of people on this able to

00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,650
make the CPC meetings during the

00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:09,619
questions about or ideas

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:14,530
that's another high value thing that we

00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:14,530
talk about Glenn

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,290
hello - grandson awareness is very new

00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,370
to people so for people that remember

00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:28,840
supplementation just joined as an

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:30,220
individual organization are they going

00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,470
to be grown father Dean tuition

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,350
organization is that we thought about

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:38,530
that so whether it be individual members

00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:40,960
will people join individual member

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:46,240
therican foundation if they were member

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,340
node foundation would they be so I'm

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,070
gonna let Tracy answer the question yeah

00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,650
so we have a proposal for the bootstrap

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,800
phase of work around individual

00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:00,520
membership it just needs to be applied

00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:04,510
and expanded so the idea is I believe

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,760
that was accepted so far was that there

00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,070
would not be an individual necessarily a

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,350
foundation xre of membership for a

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:16,180
specific project it would be for the

00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:17,800
foundation over all the details of that

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,630
are yet to be worked out in

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,440
implementation details that we need to

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:26,080
do now but there ought around that was

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,520
that looked the CPC was formed this is

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,560
something that needs to be owned with

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,870
sort of a subcommittee because the

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,180
individual membership hasn't stood was

00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:37,060
very nodes metric obviously with the

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,500
design and with many projects

00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,630
potentially being represented not

00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,790
necessarily every single one because

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,010
that's not necessarily that every

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:48,010
project would wanna be mp3 is part of

00:36:45,010 --> 00:37:05,740
that program but there is a basic design

00:36:48,010 --> 00:37:08,410
that's been laid out we just like

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:11,200
yourself you're already a member of the

00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,390
no project and all of those members I

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,000
see as being part of the foundation for

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,980
example if you remember and participate

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,670
in the no project you can not self

00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:23,680
nominate as a CPC regular so you're

00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,510
already kind of a member it's more like

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,609
if you wanted so that's the opportunity

00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,969
for people aren't able to

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,819
as directly to become individual member

00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:37,059
so let's just want to clarify I said if

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:47,049
we're already a member but we appreciate

00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:48,700
your financial training one of the

00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,680
community directors that existed in the

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,739
nude foundation prior to the merger was

00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:56,529
the individual member director with the

00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:59,529
new bylaws that directorship still

00:37:56,529 --> 00:38:05,380
exists but it requires four thousand

00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:08,559
members program to 2,000 a number that

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:11,140
we're gonna revisit any ways to activate

00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,849
well that was what we talked about of

00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,079
the board was that like if that number

00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,700
can't be reached it doesn't seem

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,640
reasonable that we can discuss it in

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,959
figure out but overall we're gonna try

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,819
to ramp up the program

00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:23,859
Tracie's put together like a really

00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:26,200
amazing proposal that includes like

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:28,319
price points and rolling it out and what

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,359
would be the benefits of the program so

00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,160
as Tracy was mentioning like there is

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,690
totally the intention of still rolling

00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:52,269
out full individual membership program a

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:55,660
team of people did it yeah one of the

00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:57,549
things we had a core number people but

00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,079
now we're hoping to get more people from

00:38:57,549 --> 00:39:00,430
across the project to get involved

00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,130
there's lots of different work to be

00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:08,219
done so hopefully everybody he says he

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:08,219
is interesting and coming

00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:22,980
ok-ran um obviously will be here for

00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,619
basically all weekend and also this week

00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:29,369
so if there's any questions that you

00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:32,540
think of in the meantime about the CPC

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:40,280
or about how to get involved you can

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:46,290
come put any for anybody control Joe

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:51,390
Chris everybody and we would like to

00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:55,470
welcome you into program in Syria so

00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:58,650
with our last 15 minutes I was going to

00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:01,380
suggest that we potentially arrange some

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,720
breakout sessions in order to generate

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,130
some proposals and forward momentum on

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,140
some of the issues that were identifying

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:17,130
let's just super quickly be recap with

00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:21,109
the proposal process yeah so we have a

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:24,720
staging process for CPC proposals so and

00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:26,400
Mosel can be anything it changed to how

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,150
many Charter things it can be a program

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:35,490
idea so for example one of the program

00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:37,890
ideas that we have as a recognition if

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,570
you have something that you'd like to

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:43,859
see or service that you'd like to see

00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:47,070
the foundation take on all you have to

00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:50,460
do is create a pull request on the CPC

00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,440
repo as a state zero proposal and then

00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,310
what we do is iterate on those ideas for

00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,240
Fineman until we are able to adopt in

00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:04,320
this stage three slash final so kind of

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,050
a little take on the TC process my

00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,300
proposal is that we have some breakout

00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,339
sessions while we're out here to

00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,330
generate stage there are proposals for

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:16,770
some of these items and the ones that we

00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:20,210
identified and the t already has what

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,560
their travel fund management we have

00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,760
some body of work already around

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,600
onboarding but that needs to be refined

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,830
we have the elections topic

00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:35,230
and that discussing to that we have it

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,960
our infrastructure so let me just like

00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,720
quickly describe the problem space here

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,560
we have 31 projects all of which have

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:49,120
different setups and infrastructure

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:52,030
needs it's kind of a hot mess and mine

00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,830
is not we need we desperately need to

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,550
streamline it because it's very hard to

00:41:53,830 --> 00:42:01,060
manage so I'd love to talk to folks

00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:03,310
about that and then there was an idea

00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,290
for a recognition program the Jazz

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:09,220
foundation we said recognition program

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,390
it was kind of a failure but I think

00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:15,490
there's some ideas around it no

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:17,440
recognition program I love roast at

00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,770
again they make use of the spaces that

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,360
we had for this how does anybody have a

00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:26,880
recommendation for how we can proceed to

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:31,480
organize these or should I just like no

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,460
gross spaghetti if you want to talk

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:40,590
about the next this Symington transition

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:43,780
I'm going to that table over there I

00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:49,570
love to talk about infrastructure for

00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:51,940
projects so and I'm basically so anybody

00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:58,720
who has who would like to tackle that

00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:05,370
with me anybody want to take any of the

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,370
others all right - project onboarding

00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:46,640
anybody and know who is not in their own

00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:48,710
and I meant from NPM I think well

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,130
they're interested in the recognition

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,710
stuff so if you have talks on what the

00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:58,369
foundation can do to say thank you to

00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:03,570
our membership for contributors or for

00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:06,040
me Tanner's let's chat with those folks

00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,480
[Music]

00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:25,340
if there's no other ideas for breakout

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:32,000
sessions we can conclude that many of us

00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:34,070
office code in this case tonight thanks

00:44:32,000 --> 00:45:03,380
for considering Jen mode and vigilant

00:44:34,070 --> 00:45:04,490
wonder if it spreads us - all right so

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,440
if you're interested in any of these

00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:14,650
topics so find those individuals will

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:14,650
call this session yeah thank you so much

00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,260
