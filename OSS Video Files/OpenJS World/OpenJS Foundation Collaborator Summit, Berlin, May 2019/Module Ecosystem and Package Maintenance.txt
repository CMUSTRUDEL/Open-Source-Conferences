	00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,000
those key parts we're going to have a

00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:10,590
prop so this is why we've come into

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,820
existence we're just starting off layer

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,029
writing trying to write set of rules

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,699
about best practices how do we in a good

00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:22,060
way offer our help to a package

00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:24,160
developer that are made one helper may

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,529
not even want to give up ownership it

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,260
may want to keep ownership maybe a

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:32,470
little to stress to what's going on so

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,380
in the open source world let's go to our

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,540
repo we're we're documenting what we're

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,050
doing here we're a reasonably large team

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,390
ten people participating grow

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,579
communities every two weeks and we're

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,800
covering some very basic stuff to begin

00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,980
with you know like what are our rules on

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,350
licensing how should we encourage people

00:00:50,980 --> 00:01:19,000
follow in assembler versioning because

00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:22,420
when we adopt a package no idea so these

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,280
are some of our goals we obviously want

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,880
to connect and get a feedback from some

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,409
of the package maintainers out there

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
once we figure out kind of like what

00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:34,210
we're doing we're going to discuss what

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,650
that work looks like um build maybe some

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:40,210
tools to the community has some ideas

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,479
and then we're going to need to

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:49,360
evangelize what we're doing um to

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:53,009
everybody so people that might be

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,979
interested in this work obviously us hi

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,420
some you know the node collaborators

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,820
package maintainers and project

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,920
collaborators

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,460
we're some ideas of who we thought might

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,369
be super interested in this and this is

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,849
like a basic agenda of some topics that

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,590
we can talk about of course we can delve

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:22,690
into whatever people find

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,690
might be useful as well so

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,540
low maintenance these this is drafts

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,159
obviously so if you're curious about

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,220
what we've been working on any what we

00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,330
start in where we're at this is a good

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,390
place to start

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,390
you

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,520
and I had enough

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,520
you

00:02:50,079 --> 00:04:49,550
okay idea for example we are new to your

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:53,210
package is filled this could be

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,690
beautiful for company that need to

00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,610
choose and

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:03,000
must be conscious about the support of

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,000
this

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,970
yeah I'm just gonna say can I add two

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,640
cents so how many people here already

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,410
used that the license yield of the

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,740
package state in terms of figuring out

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,630
places okay that's a pretty good number

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,400
how many people think that looking at a

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,410
support that's provided information

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,040
about this rating something you would

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:30,200
use a similar way okay so that's good

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,970
feedback like we were thinking that you

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,850
might avoid any more information and

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,410
some of the tools to help ala dated

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:45,010
eleven users make additional choices

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:49,960
I guess so still uses the SPX

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:53,780
spinner for this with the intention be a

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,690
standard format for the identifier so

00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,250
they introduce their own as part of what

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,830
we've documented we've talked you into

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,020
the initial set you know here's the

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,680
initial you know three-letter acronyms

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,690
what they mean and the idea would be

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,370
pronounced people would be the source of

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,370
that people if you are an additional one

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,390
we've tried not to make it like there's

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,510
no ordering implying so basically if you

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,040
want something you guard it and not

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,310
something that people can understand

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,200
what you mean and then the other one

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,610
other question there would be I assume

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:35,470
that it's for the street standard text

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:38,360
[Music]

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,560
yeah we could actually yeah maybe we'll

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,820
maybe we'll go through but maybe you

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,680
could have four we can jump into that

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:54,980
and show us that in more detail

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:57,080
afterwards so this is very similar to

00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,630
something I've been personally thinking

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,000
about for a while which is that late

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,640
software licenses offer this really

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,680
amazing signal that you can just see MIT

00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,510
or a patchy and it tells you a lot of

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,910
what you need to know about like the

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,919
legality of it but not a lot of them it

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,970
is not a lot about the support contract

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,070
and when we think of an open-source

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,400
today there's the OSI defin

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,720
the source and that's just about the

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,460
license it's not about the maintenance

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,570
at all and that's very ambiguous and

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,660
that's where a lot of problems come from

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:29,900
[Music]

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,720
the two challenges I see with using the

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,800
package JSON format for this and I'm not

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,650
saying that it's not the right place to

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,930
do it one would be that it doesn't have

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,670
from immediately looking at a repo

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,730
unless github built on top of this

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,910
metadata the same signal that a license

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,890
- and one of the things that I i've been

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,010
using the term social source as an idea

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,080
of like what this could be like in the

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,110
same way that we have a license could

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,420
there be a file or three letters that

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,360
you put in like how how is a way that we

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,980
could have the same signal that doesn't

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,980
require having to go through and look

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:12,470
through bunch of metadata to parse it

00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:16,670
out and yeah yeah I think if if we agree

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,110
if we agree on the values then Taxation

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,910
might be one way to deliver it but

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,380
coming up with other ones like yeah you

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,230
think a file in the week well when we

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,760
say but this file in with chakra choice

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,070
an order different for totally make

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,410
sense yeah and one of the things I

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:37,460
thought about there was kind of like the

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:39,740
way the CC license see like CC BY oh why

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,060
this is like these series of acronyms

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,940
that kind of tell you everything you

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,530
need to know the other small concern

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,630
that I would have with the package JSON

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,960
and this is like you've probably should

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,170
just ignore me but is we parse the

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,970
package JSON endo every single time you

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,560
require our module at least in the scope

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:03,590
of a module as part of our resolution

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,900
opera and so I'm not hugely in favor of

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,570
throwing and lots more metadata into

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,250
every single package JSON alter of the

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:13,010
tree now this may just feel like I'm

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,210
micro optimization but like because it

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,380
is a pattern that people use all over

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,150
the place but my intuition is if there's

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,850
other places we could put it that may be

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,370
preferable but like that's a micro

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,830
optimization and maybe maybe you should

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,900
ignore me no no you're right and we'd be

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,100
delighted to get

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,140
point where we have so many packages

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,589
we're maintaining we could their problem

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:42,040
ecosystem you know but reading agreement

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:44,529
of getting like answer well about get

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,029
anyway just think about we're wanting to

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,770
get to the point where like an NPM and

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:53,170
it would add this in for you with the

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:56,020
value so when you get there related

00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,370
issues of the previous is what I think

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,860
is what happens when people start to you

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,810
know realize that they don't feel like

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,480
they want maintained at magnet anymore

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,940
because at that point if this data is in

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,210
the package.json he would effectively

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,270
require them to push felt a new release

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,690
with a new version in order to push out

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,910
a pack of JSON data and this may eat too

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,350
much of an ask for someone who's

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:34,209
effectively giving up on maintaining

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:36,970
about it can entirely won't be

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:40,240
considered a December a major change

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,000
here and at that one yeah asking for

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,160
that is is not just just about getting

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,020
the update so what actually you're

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,850
looking right is packaged maintenance

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,230
team not being able support because what

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,580
we really looking at those when we it's

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,830
really it's going to be a team

00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,930
developers we're evangelizing or will

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:03,520
actually be doing this not just a

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,990
develop right but I guess I'll this may

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,550
be something that the team would do

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,740
wouldn't be doctor but I'm in my mind

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,730
we're still gonna ask everybody to put

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,130
this in yeah

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,690
but I I still think that if you're in

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,570
the case where you'd like totally just

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,860
said I'm doing nothing then maybe that's

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,450
something like the packets maintenance

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,650
team might have a role in finding like

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,060
this module has clearly been abandoned

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,550
well it will adopt to the point where

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,230
you do this one PR to change that if

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,779
you're a no if you're a mental owner and

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,690
you just don't want to have anybody bug

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,670
you anymore I'm hoping eventually it's

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,920
worthwhile for you to do that one little

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,600
thing because it may cut down on like

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,500
whether you get issues where the people

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,970
are complaining

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,210
banging on your door you can say no look

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,070
I said it's unsupported you know it's it

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,470
part of it is like if there's a mismatch

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,620
of expectations or the users think this

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,390
is a highly well maintained module on

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,310
the other hand somebody the owner thinks

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:01,540
this is just a hobby that I do on the

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,160
side you have no support communicating

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,660
that if you close the gap then both

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,090
people should be a little bit happier

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,650
because you can point to this and say

00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,030
well look this is my expectation and

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,820
there's no reason you should have the

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,680
same expectations so I think I can see

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,450
that in the case where the module owner

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,040
just doesn't do anything but it's really

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:23,230
hard to do anything in that case right

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,510
so I'm not as worried I just looked to

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,370
all the points that were just discussed

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,220
that even though they explore not having

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,500
it in the package of JSON file because

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,200
yes can you marry distance partners we

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,380
publish by putting it in the repo may

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,920
not different file and also less effort

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:50,440
or not in the path of critical access to

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:52,090
performance issues all the packages we

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,980
deal with the class of that there's

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,070
nothing better but a critical thing to

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,400
watch this just like NPM on it or tools

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,870
they can today after you install parts

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
through all the files and figure out

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,050
whether you're licensed or okay we need

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,640
the data to be there once you've done

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:13,540
your install right so I don't know where

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:16,660
else other than the package Jason having

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,120
a separate file that is dedicated for

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,040
that it's probably better for tooling

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,170
creators and all companies that happen

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,650
to own tools to know where to look for

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:30,510
different how do you get those files no

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,510
you reckon you define a specification

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,200
it's not an argument if you're placing

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:41,490
the support with a URL to the place

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,530
where the supports to find I kind of

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,630
yeah it's when this important can change

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,550
when the code doesn't change in fact

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,330
that's really it's particularly likely

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,149
when you

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,940
you published it is not so much it's too

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:57,399
much work but the reality is that like

00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:31,709
all of the versions lost support at the

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:34,209
same time not just the latest version I

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:36,160
like the idea of it just being like I

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,870
want you to go from the pack of Tyson to

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,630
the information but I quite like the

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,589
idea like you can just be a URL which

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,589
you host forever

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:02,800
that could be like sure we could party

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,399
published a few mods will you include

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:15,550
this ball that would be worth the other

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:18,970
changes and also serious I mean we would

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,190
support on a beat lake if you have to be

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:26,649
building out a person who like the

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:30,130
benefit of this is like we can do yellow

00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,709
frontmatter that's gross I might just do

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,010
that same section in this isn't maybe

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:43,959
sort of Jason like might yes yeah but

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:45,699
you know III I think that saying we

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,190
should put things in package Jason like

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,649
I am the person a person

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,300
thank you probably associative whatever

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,620
I would say it's become standard to do

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,790
that right that's what never what

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,410
doesn't reduce stuff and I think it's

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,329
it's ignoring this the state of the

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,279
world did you ask to not do that

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:05,819
like that's how thing

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,319
are expected and I think like if you

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,569
wanted to do that we'd have to go and

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,100
like define package Jason as a spec and

00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,990
saying anything else in this is invalid

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,230
it'll throw which we're not going to do

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,569
and so I do think it's a little bit of

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,499
like it's a little bit going around the

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:24,569
rest of the world we don't do this

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,980
system and I think that you know this is

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:27,959
something that people can very easily

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,329
build in their purchase your eyes like

00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,370
when I'm in him selling it comes to run

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,490
this another MPX script that will or

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,309
package it will throw if any of the

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,069
thousand of my new models have something

00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:44,480
that I'm not willing to use I think

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:44,480
having a personal in a very

00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:52,230
non-traditional though is not really the

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:57,029
only place that has kind of specific

00:16:52,230 --> 00:17:01,110
metadata the NPM repository or any

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,910
dozens of deprecation notices butchery

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,350
and I think he's got a couple deter the

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,839
distance now I get salad like we're

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,620
installing that's one of the packages

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,880
specific version independent metadata

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,039
that might not be an inappropriate

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,020
thanks for this sort of exhibition as

00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:22,100
well but that might require sort of

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:31,110
defining what does an Indian package

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:34,649
repository look like one more time it's

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:39,030
challenge might be slippery so again any

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:41,010
don't mean to stop relying heavily on

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,390
package.json makes it an extremely

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:48,750
JavaScript specific solution I think

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,480
that this movement that we're talking

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,240
about here is as important as

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,059
open-source is as important as licenses

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,220
and we really should be talking about

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:03,510
solutions that are language agnostic and

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,580
yes in the same way that there's a

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:10,409
license field that can refer to a thing

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:13,140
like CC BY I know whatever the artifact

00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:16,450
that that codifies this at length I

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:21,220
think if possible should be

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,200
for independent and you know something

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,930
that has that signal I was I was talking

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,850
about before and it is very possible

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,820
that that is not the scope of what your

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:34,300
team is trying to accomplish that I do

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,310
think that this is very important it's

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,680
something that's missing from the

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,840
programming ecosystem it is burning out

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,150
tons of developers in every single

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,520
community I think it's something that we

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,470
could as a foundation of Hertz the OSI

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
about and be like hey let's work on this

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,130
together so I would challenge you to

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,020
perhaps think at a bigger scale of

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,180
influence and effect and that the

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:04,830
package.json may actually be limiting

00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,830
our ability to to scale this up formally

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,230
yeah but it's very possible that the

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,060
package.json is the incorrect and

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,980
metadata in there and the license pilot

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,970
and the repo is a different license and

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,370
I firmly not a lawyer panel I'm pretty

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,660
sure that the physical license and the

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:39,580
folder would likely Trump that so I'm

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,020
just I don't know that it's the source

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,180
of truth but yeah it is what we write a

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:48,510
lot of tools relying on that being a

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,510
reliable source yes

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,110
likewise and the Linux community like

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:31,180
and in the web browser world duck

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,650
well-known is also another well-known is

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:40,450
also straight because it's just free

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:45,790
form less I'm just referencing those

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:48,640
this I also do interaction effect it up

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:51,270
in a previous role I have access to a

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,600
lot of the entire registries licenses

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:57,970
you don't like random numbers and there

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,780
there are a lot of typos a package a

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,980
spouse and a lot of weird things II

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:07,620
wouldn't expect to be in the license

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,620
field of a magnate chasin so like yes I

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:15,280
definitely question you figured out how

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:20,320
do you relate to be in their research

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:23,680
projects on the open transformation in

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,510
reason I don't think it necessarily

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,480
relates directly to whether you're

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,550
emeritus or something else it's it's

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,200
more about like if you could be an

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,420
emeritus project but still have active

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,820
support right like it's it's not about

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:41,280
we're adding features grinding this it's

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,750
more like if you if you report an issue

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,760
what kind of response can you looks

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,340
about you know is there isn't going to

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,170
be like never or on our best effort or

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,280
no well we we usually try respond within

00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:56,230
seven days or and and the the target

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,580
actually is around what versions of know

00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,470
you're supporting so that's actually a

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,000
little bit note specifics over a little

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,610
back and say we should absolutely try

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,870
and generalize and you know we don't

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,700
want to limit ourselves arrow I think we

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,680
should put something in place we think

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,360
will work there and then no single this

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,730
is actually broader issues would like to

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,190
working example it's good the targeted

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,440
one is about late these are the LTS

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,740
releases we support we target supporting

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,930
all LTS releases or just the latest LTS

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,180
release or almost no releases right and

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,250
that's still an emeritus project could

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,650
choose any one of those options right

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,600
it's about as a consumer

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:35,240
Blayne might I have to change or update

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,410
because the very next release current

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,289
comes out that's all these supports are

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,330
gonna do that actually relate the

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,880
question how is that different from the

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,950
interview mm-hmm

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,539
engine I think says specific versions of

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,090
know right so maybe there's some overlap

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,650
there enough code this was more like you

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,030
know you could say health and one week

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,280
that we can look at the things we

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,110
defined but like LTS was like we're

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,000
targeting supporting all lines of LTS

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,620
release but no one particular version

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,169
but like today is a smart 712 it means

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,700
ten and twelve point so the timing may

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,070
be the thing that have accents them and

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,470
then the backing one is like for

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,150
America's going again I think we still

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,549
have allegation which sort of says like

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:18,200
what kind of backing is there behind

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,970
this is it like one person in there

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,890
basically who just doesn't find which is

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:26,000
the hockey one or is there like a

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:28,070
business or organization that well it's

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,510
not like you can choose one module

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,770
versus the other based on that but it's

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:36,530
more information like like they just

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,830
wanted to add because what miles was

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,710
outlining is actually you know I think

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,049
the picture what hydrants is doing so

00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,620
when you go in and claim a package type

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:50,299
lift you can indicate in there which

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,539
releases are obsolete

00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:57,020
LTS maintained one lap and the whole

00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:59,630
model is a corporate side you know me

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,039
would ingest type of stays that flows

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,850
back into the painting the package

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,220
managers package containers and we get

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,140
the data of what supported reports all

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,030
of that right so there I believe they're

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:17,980
they already have an implemented and

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:17,980
they are also working with may be worth

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:26,210
you know contacts or I personally I

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,370
wasn't alone buxom but I can I can serve

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:36,710
in the government yeah if you give - in

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:39,350
contacts and we have also made when we

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,960
teach to collaborate week to the green

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:48,740
paper for example or add in you

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:52,620
feature and new optimization let's say

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:59,120
so we have started to talk with them but

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:59,120
not build something useful right now

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,850
looking at the image I noticed that all

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,820
the things are uppercase of this

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:19,140
targeted response backing and everything

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:24,210
else Laura gates is this somebody's

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,310
mandated or is it in terms of yeah we

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,820
just we just made them all off the case

00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:34,680
okay link even the name name property

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:37,320
value has to be lowercase so like I go

00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,870
to like semantics and like small things

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,500
but like the rest a lot of the rest of

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:45,900
this is that something that could be

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,240
changed absolutely there's a reason for

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,550
them to be lowercase yeah I think it

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,980
sort of came from in a lot of cases if

00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,750
we have short forms or acronyms those

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,250
tend to be capitalized yeah but it's

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,290
nothing more than that coming

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,550
I'm just curious the back as it like

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,060
stood out to me for my attend my

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:06,660
experience right I don't know what do

00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:11,730
they do for licenses it's the acronym

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:15,060
but like none and best ever - yeah yeah

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,500
and I make somebody feel amazing it's

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:22,200
like cannot be like nobody using

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:28,380
something like look at that more

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:48,420
carefully I'm just yeah this is also in

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:55,100
drop okay then we have tried also to

00:26:48,420 --> 00:27:02,770
lists all the criterias to understand we

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:10,070
package needs we hunt first so we have

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:14,260
tried to recap all day a long a long a

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:20,380
long issue that has been discussed and

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:24,919
we can finally build this this list so

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:31,990
you think we have for sure the number of

00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:35,830
them Lots the moon the number of the

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:44,000
rods of the dependency tree for example

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:51,950
there is indication that is useful for

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:56,990
express that used by experts itself and

00:27:51,950 --> 00:28:03,340
not directly for exam so that she was

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:07,070
tricky how many packages depends on the

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,850
module how the member of the dependency

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:18,470
in this case for example less

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:24,409
dependencies could be more easy to fix

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:29,120
that module we of course evaluated all

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:38,559
also the the test is not Russia because

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:41,600
this could be more secure to help that

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:47,659
that code base in order to don't break

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:51,950
of course the idea if the dependencies

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:57,200
are updated or not if there are also the

00:28:51,950 --> 00:29:02,020
prophetic dependencies if they Rico have

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:05,860
many issue open or of course if it's

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,600
maintained by the company and this is

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,920
not

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:17,070
we don't have an idea for this person

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:21,430
yet because we don't know if we want

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:24,700
free help company in this case for

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:29,140
example well of course the last

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:33,940
activities the maintainer are working on

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:40,360
that module or not most recent irate

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:51,240
yeah it's a plus so I think that this

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:51,240
list could be more long do you have

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:17,680
there's things like how many commits

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:27,180
were made between releases a lot of the

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:27,180
information from thank you personally I

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:38,050
listen that first we can't I was just

00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:41,260
curious what you meant when you said

00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:55,560
that you want to help do you mean like

00:30:41,260 --> 00:31:02,650
do you want to reach out and ask correct

00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:09,220
first first we have identified some

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:14,530
violence packages that help us to happen

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:20,320
let's say so we can try the tools that

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:24,399
we or also

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:28,299
roll and process and then bring all

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:33,789
these knows how to the Internet

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:38,620
community in order to and like without

00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:41,230
training mmm biased let's say but for

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:46,059
sure we have to the first step we need

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:50,080
to go with little steps let's say they

00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:54,340
want packages is the first they find the

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:59,549
list of all the packages and we don't

00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:05,230
know how many for example but without

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:12,070
prioritize our friends because we want

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:16,740
to be agnostic so we try to list those

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:24,879
rules in order to to find potential

00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:26,830
maintainer that's meat so there's two

00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:29,200
parts one we want to figure out how to

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,929
let people and companies care help

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,490
maintainer so if there's businesses who

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,039
really depend on a whole bunch of

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,529
modules it's a risk to their business if

00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,539
those modules are having problems

00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:42,549
keeping up the date being maintained and

00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:44,409
so ideally you know some of the things

00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:47,289
we've talked about it's like tools which

00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:48,639
not us look that's a helpful business

00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,730
understand here all the modules you

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,409
depend on and then hopefully how do you

00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,720
turn that into like a business case

00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:57,279
eternity to say let's go out and make

00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,720
contributions to these modules because

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,059
it's in our own business so that they're

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,919
sure that angle if not just the package

00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,230
makings team going out and helping but

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,330
trying to help close the gap so that

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,639
people who are dependent get the benefit

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,679
get help and then separately you know we

00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:13,389
got quite a number of people who sort of

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,080
join the team saying how could I help

00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:19,059
and we're trying to build like a smaller

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,220
backlog list that says if you're

00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,409
interested in helping here are some

00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,450
things that package maintainers you know

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,009
and that's where the previous one stuck

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,440
we can't do that for all model but

00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:32,409
critical models here's some places where

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,700
you can get involved and help as useful

00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,710
because a lot of time

00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,660
I don't know how to start right so it's

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,730
like to build a backlog that says here's

00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,770
how you can start and a bit of a team

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,480
that can help people who want to get

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,400
involved maybe bootstrap them or

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:56,640
whatever so that's what we mean by -

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:59,710
helps so okay so when you are saying

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,080
have people help you can help this team

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:07,180
figure out these processes your tools or

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:10,720
you can help like the writers to help

00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,110
the actual powers yeah like a name to

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,940
meet you

00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,520
we obviously want people to help give

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:20,520
this government in place but the end

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,520
goal is to try and get more help

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:30,929
right exactly like they're they think

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:34,600
that is important for the ecosystem the

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:36,910
success note they're interested and and

00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,880
we can help build a concrete list but

00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:42,070
then other people as opposed to late if

00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,460
you just say hey everybody come and join

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:47,650
my project it's it may become the dots

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,770
hatchet harder and we're hoping by

00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:51,970
having someone organized group kind of

00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,770
think you read the way those things work

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,140
we can make out actually that under the

00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,750
pact it's a hard problem but that's kind

00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,700
of the goal I really respect that a lot

00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,310
because I think that one of the things

00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,190
about volunteers volunteering like

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:08,080
Association to programs it's hard to

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,360
concerning without acumen like to

00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,550
interface kind of hold your hand and

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,290
like encourage you to even really yeah

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:20,350
so this idea that that you're gonna

00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:29,830
provide a human interface to people want

00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:34,320
to get started they're so into the

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:37,720
criteria there whether it's by a company

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,630
you know I would stress that really

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,940
needs to be tightening watch Jesus is

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,440
being a vectors the company gets a model

00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,370
out there they just like they don't want

00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,109
support it anymore

00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,410
they basically rely on our community

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,459
that's the over free support for

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,039
something too big but other they're

00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:55,599
still looking abandoned front so you

00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,549
know whether they want to help our

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,380
knowing like I think you actually want

00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:01,599
to emphasize on that that they are they

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,759
just will supporters of this thing and

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,749
are they basically banning and you don't

00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:08,920
expect them to be the ecosystem this you

00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,349
know I keep it going

00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,200
the other other thing that we need to

00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:16,150
watch here is when didn't open source

00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,640
market become a company supported model

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,579
right so when an interview of an

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,880
individual is working on something and

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:30,309
they get hired by a company right and I

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:33,069
company thing it is getting commercial

00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:34,930
benefit out of that module right but you

00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:36,640
know it's still you know the ecosystem

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,759
there we still need providing support

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,329
for that's to win you know when we pull

00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:51,699
the support back when there's a company

00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:54,369
involved yes these are the things so it

00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:55,319
is only days yeah a lot of the work

00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:58,719
we're doing here now

00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:01,809
perhaps most exciting a special work of

00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:05,229
writing code but a mystery divider

00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:07,420
framework all of these equals operator V

00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:09,729
then we won't have to do this we know

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,920
eventually we're going to be right the

00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:15,069
ecosystem it's getting very large and

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,599
we're seeing some people getting region

00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:19,630
points in their life as I said we're

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,459
actually can't do things they thought

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,619
they could do when they but it'll be

00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:26,890
younger they have some different

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,819
objectives and these are now critical

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:33,940
for not just for individuals them is

00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:36,699
very very large corporations but unless

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,079
we have a framework handling this we

00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:40,839
won't bear to engage shows other

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,130
entities it's real as our entities at

00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,130
the engaged adventure

00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:01,640
so one of the first candidate is a

00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:06,450
package that I'm arrogant manga which is

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,519
mqt say yes this is long long ago I

00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,009
never this between two thousand twelve

00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,930
thousand thirteen did a lot of nice talk

00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,210
conference talks about it and son did a

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,579
lot of nice and gentle things Dima then

00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:21,089
my job I changed it what they was doing

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:26,579
and I'm not using as part of my job at

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:29,460
all and right now I just who we just

00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,369
pushed a major major version oh so

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,339
things are not super bad the problem

00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:38,130
main problem is that there's a hundred

00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:42,359
and thirty hundred forty issues of

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:47,369
people asking for anything and there's

00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:51,180
no absolute zero time to even like start

00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:56,700
to tackle it there are several issues in

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:59,190
the repo itself that for example we are

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,009
tied to an old version of mocha well

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:04,769
we're not tied but we run mocha with

00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:07,920
some legacy flags and essentially

00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:09,809
because the tests are super flaky so

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,829
essentially it's impossible to say that

00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:16,980
something was passing or not so this

00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:18,930
makes doing anywhere very very hard we

00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,730
found that several times and says okay

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,579
I'm confident enough this is not

00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,470
breaking it but there are several

00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:28,890
revisions of that and it's a very

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:36,660
hopeful basis in organically you know

00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:40,230
girl with Springs of people working you

00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,940
know so just want to say that you that's

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:48,839
a target it's currently used by

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:53,910
Microsoft IBM problem well you know I

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:57,720
need to check that for identi SDK this

00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:01,150
is my shiny moment we chopped as well

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,710
this is recommended way we shot in China

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:08,579
and there is issuing positive Chinese so

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,710
that's what you know okay

00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:15,460
like after he's been using a lot of fun

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:17,799
places but Laura is part of the

00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:21,369
dependencies of no drag which is an

00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:25,599
opposition and yeah that is the

00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,520
situation basically a tiny group of

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,799
people that's you know trying to keep up

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:36,510
their small volunteer income and support

00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:39,160
for 1955 which is still it's essentially

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,200
it's very hard there are certain issues

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,450
that need to be faced very hard issues

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,579
related to connection as somebody's

00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,579
there were somebody that did fantastic

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,200
yes a man accosted an analysis a text

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,930
analysis of all the issues that have

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,520
been opened so somebody this is amazing

00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,859
tool that even a bunch of issues which

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,960
tells you what are the key topics and

00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:10,180
one of the key topic is connection

00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,950
management and I know perfectly why

00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,799
people get freaked out about connection

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,289
management okay and you know there are

00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,940
parts there they're not works but you

00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:24,490
know fundamental issues in the level

00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:27,609
that you know support offline mode so if

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,950
you want for flag mode then you support

00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:31,779
recommend but then if you can connect

00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:38,529
how do you distinguish the fact that you

00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:42,490
can per match versus the vs. our

00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:45,599
services nothing okay so that is kind of

00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:48,640
a fundamental issue in the library

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,150
yeah I just want to say all of this of

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,200
all the problems okay and this is very

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:58,000
typical unfortunately Express is the

00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,980
major thing that this press team is

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,599
doing he is doing super requests they

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,150
are always asking for people to attend

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,010
with support requests the vision is this

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,039
is what these two modules have in common

00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:11,319
they are used by people new to that so

00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,800
essentially they came by a lot of people

00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:16,190
came by all this judgment

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,880
know anything about deserve 16 I am in

00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:23,140
case of MVT TM is trying to get

00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,150
something up and running with a up I or

00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,580
server already that I know nothing about

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,290
all these technologies and then this is

00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:34,160
what if these on message thing that they

00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:37,580
need to use and you know I'll going to

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,350
build or die if it's a topic here you

00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:44,480
know and and that's kind of the big air

00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:46,070
the beginning kind of the bigger issue

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,240
happens a lot of commit you ought to be

00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:53,690
done like 10 points taste hey Dante has

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,720
bang go there don't stay here this is

00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:04,150
your bunk getting any help here okay and

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:04,150
stop Chinese you know you know

00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,849
[Music]

00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:40,010
okay sure so I guess really you know

00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:44,180
just end up that way oh this is just

00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:45,560
some of our initial ideas you know we

00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,910
want to clear out what works what

00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,470
doesn't work so we're working on best

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,140
practices but we also want to think

00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,150
about like tooling is there some common

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,280
tooling that we can generate that helps

00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,810
package maintainers in the end obviously

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,359
we don't want to tell anybody what they

00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,160
need to do but in a lot of cases if you

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,050
have a best practice and a tool to back

00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,160
that up like why not right like if you

00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:07,359
have a reason to do something that

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,470
different go for it but again it's like

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,570
trying to avoid everybody having to

00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,980
figure out some of these problems or

00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,690
things that can consume a lot of time

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,270
every time over so like they'll

00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,040
mentioned well how do I deal with like

00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:20,630
questions that are like not related to

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,210
my project well maybe we can come up

00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:27,020
with a tool that helps you do that more

00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,310
easily or tools that you know also in

00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:32,690
terms of tooling like you know there's a

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:34,550
bit of work to validate the sport on but

00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,220
we want tools to help me generate those

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:40,970
kinds of things totally it's just to say

00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:43,100
we have lots of other ideas and plus

00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:49,160
other things we'll be looking at in the

00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:54,020
future as well I guess that's the end of

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:56,780
our oh there we go people if each day

00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,930
and there are quite a few more that

00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,119
attend meetings regularly it will be a

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,940
slow thing spiral quick and the first

00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,800
few packages we help out for from your

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,540
teachers north a lot and a lot will

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,580
change and many things you've mentioned

00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,580
the property you know come to fruition

00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,560
will change and we'll learn but unless

00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,560
we do this we all know what will

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:24,590
inevitably happen to the ecosystem so

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:26,390
thank you and I'll throw in one more

00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,340
thing before I ask questions did you

00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,890
know I think we've got a lot of really

00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,020
good feedback on the support idea will

00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,060
incorporate that in our next step was to

00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,090
start like socializing that more broadly

00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:40,160
so you can keep your eye on the repo and

00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,650
jump in to make sure we understood what

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,400
your feedback was and procreated it but

00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:45,200
as soon

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,260
sort of one of our main next steps to

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,329
find there and figure out how we make it

00:45:48,260 --> 00:46:14,569
or make no reality so I think the model

00:45:50,329 --> 00:46:19,700
I questioned years okay yeah I guess

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:21,170
that's a good point actually not well I

00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,750
was gonna say but two weeks from now

00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:26,210
we'll have another one every Monday

00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:29,480
sorry yeah everything right every Monday

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,880
we have one sorry every second Monday

00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,470
every second my a suspended 3 p.m.

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,240
Eastern Standard Time we I mean we'd

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,349
love a lot more people from oh these are

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,160
the kind of things were talking about

00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:41,299
you can keep everything he can't do that

00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,619
it's all gonna get home something could

00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,619
be there too but yeah very good point

00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:51,500
well nothing to thank everybody and it's

00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,369
gonna be a slow process begin with the

00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,559
once we get going

00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:56,299
we know this is a reasonable approach to

00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,369
take two things are critical to be

00:46:56,299 --> 00:47:02,289
persistent if anyone has any ideas where

00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:02,289
