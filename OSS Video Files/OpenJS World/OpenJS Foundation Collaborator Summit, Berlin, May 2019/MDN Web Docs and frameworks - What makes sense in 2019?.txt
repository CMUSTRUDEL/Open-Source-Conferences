MDN Web Docs and frameworks content â€” what makes sense in 2019?

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,690
first a little bit about me I am Chris

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:11,580
Mills and I'm the manager of the content

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:14,400
writers team on Mozilla's mdn site and I

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,020
also do our content lead work so I spend

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,550
most of my time kind of looking at

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,460
what's coming out in the web platform

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,769
now in the near and further future just

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,920
so I can inform my team about what we

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,050
need to document and when and so we can

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,460
prioritize and have a hope of getting

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:43,500
the stuff documented by the time it

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:44,719
comes on browsers I thought we made this

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,309
my mistake

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,140
so when I find the time I also write

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,300
lots of documentation about HTML CSS

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,570
JavaScript and any other web tech that

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,520
is useful to people and I'm a total

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,609
accessibility windbag as I believe

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,320
everybody should be um so that kind of

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,960
informs and is a central theme through

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,380
all the work I do and then outside work

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm also a heavy metal drummer so if you

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,799
come and speak to me afterwards please

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,080
speak slowly I've been using that joke

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,119
for 15 years in my talks and it's still

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,409
not got old yet well maybe it was always

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,790
old so why am I here then so I've been

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,030
having some thoughts about how we could

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,740
make

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,509
mdn more useful to train work using web

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,360
developers which is I suspect probably

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:40,259
most web developers these days you know

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,400
because then on mdn we we document

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,259
basically the whole of the web platform

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,850
that's our remit you know just little

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,170
tiny thing and I just wanted to I kind

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,880
of think well you know more people in

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,740
the real world these days are using

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,140
frameworks of some kind than are just

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,610
writing stuff raw JavaScript so I'd like

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,060
to make the site more useful to these

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,700
people and so I want to outline the plan

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,070
of what I've got in my head and and just

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,210
get some ideas and talk about how folks

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,739
could help if they want to get involved

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,300
basically and you know because I

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,530
traditionally MD ends position on

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,400
documenting things like

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,410
and frameworks has always been no

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,860
because when plat form is big enough as

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,490
a thing to try and document already and

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,200
also frameworks tend to change a lot

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,440
quicker than native platform features do

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,060
so to try and kind of maintain all the

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
web platform Doc's Plus Docs and loads

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,270
of frameworks would be an absolute

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,380
nightmare would just send us all insane

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,170
and pretty much any framework or library

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,780
worth its staff has its own fairly

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,970
decent set of Doc's anyway decent in

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,040
some cases I suspect maybe not so much

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,810
in others but you know it's pointless

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,269
just reinventing the wheel all the time

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,980
you know we we do get quite a lot of

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,390
requests come in where people say hey

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,920
why don't you guys just document react

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,019
what are you guys just document angular

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,840
and we're just like do you realize how

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,010
much work that is just go away please

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,530
and another big deal that we have on

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,830
Indiana's accusations of bias you know

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,319
where were seen as this kind of platform

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,720
neutral source of truth of a lot of

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,320
different parts of the web platform so

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,000
and you know we've had this in the past

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,269
like that was that there was a time and

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,380
I was writing some MVC articles

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,170
basically to say you know this is

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,360
basically what my MVC looks on the

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,190
client side and I thought well we need

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,750
to use one framework of some kind to

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,610
demonstrate it so I chose ender because

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,860
it was popular at the time and even

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,230
though I stated very clearly in the

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,700
front of the documentation resource you

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,769
know we've only chosen em but because

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,269
it's a framework that works right now

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,769
it's not our favorite we're not

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,290
advocating this is better than anybody

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,420
else we had an absolute Fuhrer of saying

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,030
mdn biased against them but unless and

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,810
that's how it always works it's just so

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,560
we have to be very very careful of bias

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,660
so future direction then and you know I

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,760
want to get framework content on mdn but

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,549
kind of in a way that works for mdn and

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,250
also works as a useful thing for web

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,739
developers and framework vendors and

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:22,530
it's really a yeah sure is that include

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:24,690
note yes okay absolutely I mean we've

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,849
already started to put price of

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,419
complicated stuff in IBM makes me so

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:37,199
happy

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:38,310
if that thing is a lifesaver just wish

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,069
it was a little bit less rough around

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,229
the edges but people seem to like em so

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,389
there's kind of three things that I

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,159
would like to add to end the end there I

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,729
mean for a start we have a complete

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:53,279
beginners documentation section you know

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,719
just to I I wrote most of that stuff I

00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,219
like to think that it takes people not

00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:59,189
from beginner to expert the kind of

00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:01,560
beginner too comfortable you know and

00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,969
then people to have the ability to then

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,020
go and use the rest of em the end

00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,580
because we were getting loads of people

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,900
saying hey I'm a beginner and in the end

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,159
just sucks because it's just too hard

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,529
for beginners and I was like right we

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,000
need to do something about that so I did

00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:13,500
but I'd also like to add some

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,029
information in the beginner section that

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,240
though modern taught them because you

00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,710
know I still think it's the best way to

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,300
start if you're a complete beginner you

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,650
should learn the raw technologies first

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,110
before you go on to using all of the

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,939
tooling but at the same time people are

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,680
going to meet the tools as they start to

00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,629
progress towards working in the web

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,919
industry so it's pointless to kind of at

00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,389
the moment I dogs kind of protect

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,120
pretend that also exists for the most

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,610
part which is just silly so I want to

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,139
have some kind of beginners this is you

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,729
know this is modern web tool women what

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,649
you need to know where you need to use

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,330
different things that kind of section of

00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,399
course I haven't I've had the idea in my

00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,379
head for about four years but I haven't

00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,939
written it simply because I'm kind of

00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,460
terrified about trying to write it you

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,199
know how do I say to complete beginners

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,339
this is all of JavaScript tooling and

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,529
how you should use it when you should

00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,629
use it and it's just going to be a very

00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,839
hard thing to rice what boy did it and I

00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,250
probably want to I probably want to have

00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,810
something that just says here's the high

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,129
level concepts of the different tools

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,509
that you'll want to use what they are

00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,490
what they do when to use them and then

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,399
for actual low level details like actual

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,110
examples just point them to where

00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,930
different tool vendors and documentation

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,370
instead or something like that and the

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,240
second thing that we have on Indian that

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,610
might be interesting is as I've said

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,469
before I remit is basically web platform

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,479
stuff but we actually have a definition

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:35,159
of what that is you know explicitly what

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,930
we have on in the end written written

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,479
down on the site somewhere and it's

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,560
basically stuff this part of the web

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,590
platform it has been

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,270
demented in browsers now the trouble was

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,580
we started getting a whole load of folks

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,480
coming to a saying but how about things

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:55,080
like epub three it's a standard it's

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,910
used in browsers but it's not really

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,270
neat well some browsers have actually

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,250
natively put support 3 pub 3 but at the

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,450
time it wasn't and it's like well how do

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,070
you deal with that lots people know

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,780
about it but strictly according to MTN's

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,570
remit it's just no we're not going to

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,850
document it and the same thing for IMS

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,340
see if you folks know what IMS see is

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,430
it's like a sort of it's sort of a sort

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,050
of an alternative to webvtt so it does

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,060
subtitling and captions and that kind of

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,000
stuff except apparently it's more

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,210
popular in the main industries that use

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,350
that stuff like TV in TV companies and

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,850
stuff that want to put content on the

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,550
web or use IMS they just because it's

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:34,560
more powerful and buried than vtt and

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,060
it's a bit more robust but no browser

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,620
has a native implementation of it it's

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,200
just used for JavaScript libraries but

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,840
more people user than they to vtt so we

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,840
have that documented on Indian hello

00:07:49,550 --> 00:08:00,210
yeah we're - yeah yeah I think yeah yeah

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
I think that's fair to say I mean you

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,910
know there's some parts of it are

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,050
natively implemented as well it's just

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,970
there's a lot of stuff that still isn't

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,200
so but yeah we're trying to get an X

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,560
across again that's another huge thing

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,669
to document but we're getting there and

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,280
so in long story short cuz I have

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,590
started to ramble and I would also be

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,720
interested in talking to people from

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,370
smaller frameworks or libraries that

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,780
thing you know I'd like to find a place

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,000
to put my documentation because I

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,470
haven't got a place yet you know I

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,970
wouldn't mind experimenting with maybe

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,680
having a couple of small libraries or

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,010
frameworks getting them documented and

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,719
mdn you see how that feels and then the

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,200
third part of what I want to try and do

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,310
which is probably the biggest part is

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,050
you know kind of thinking again as I

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,060
said before it's pointless for me just

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,190
to try and regurgitate

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,690
react documentation away over because

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,970
ReactOS which already has good

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,410
documentation but I'd like to create

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,260
some sort of resource which would

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,220
contain loads of little tips or tidbits

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,360
or fa Q's or warnings

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,600
whatever you like to think of it

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,310
different entries that kind of thing

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,620
things that would provide useful

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,420
information about different frameworks

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,790
so you know first and we could maybe

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,490
nest nestled those in context inside our

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,750
existing reference pages so you could

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,709
maybe have something along the lines of

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,990
you know you go to a particular

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,279
JavaScript method page and maybe it

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,550
could say something like you know blah

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,829
blah blah oh oh by the way this doesn't

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,610
play nicely inside react because of the

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:26,949
way react is it is created you know just

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,730
as a sort of a the vein example off the

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,670
top of my head

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,500
so therefore to work around this problem

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,720
you should do this you know useful

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,579
little pieces of information in context

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:43,209
and MVM are sort of the main thing I'm

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:44,290
looking to do and that's kind of a bit

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,779
of a challenge again because obviously

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,399
there's loads of information that could

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,939
be represented in these different best

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,379
practices and so I'd want to talk to

00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,389
some of the framework vendors about you

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:58,930
know what you know what are their most

00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,250
common pain points of people trying to

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,860
learn their framework what are the most

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,480
common FA cues that come up and they

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,360
have to answer them all the time this is

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,980
a project I'd hope would be able to

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,009
provide definitive answers for those

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,300
kind of questions and you know from

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,670
Indians point of view it would allow us

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,540
to get more readers and more readers

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,559
means executives are happy etc etc but

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,750
from their point of view it would be

00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,279
more of a kind of you know the answers

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,470
to these questions are now available in

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,000
clear places which means that hopefully

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,399
we'll get asked and less and be able to

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,439
spend more time fixing bugs on the

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,689
framework and calling new coding new

00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:36,040
framework and features rather than just

00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:39,250
answering questions with people all the

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,610
time and the way I'm thinking of doing

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,980
this is like rather than I mean we the

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,579
the closest thing we have so far - this

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,870
is friend of mine called Eric Bailey who

00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,040
lives in Boston went around and

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,350
basically added an accessibility

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,439
concerns section to all of the HTML CSS

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,540
reference pages so for every single HTML

00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:00,160
and CSS property now there's a little

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,380
accessibility concerns thing that says

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,720
you know for example for that ground

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,940
color oh you need to be careful of

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,340
making sure your color contrast is

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,630
hi enough sober this is an accessibility

00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,970
problem you know these kind of bits of

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,280
information so but I'm thinking of doing

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,340
something like that but for useful

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,660
information about frameworks and the

00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,370
stuff that Eric wrote and in the end is

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,560
hard-coded into each page for what I'd

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,970
like to do is something more like to

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
have a set of structured data which

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,750
would contain all of these different

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,340
best practices in the same way that we

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,270
do for our browser compact a tree and in

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,330
the end you know we have all of our

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:39,320
browser compact data set in a repo which

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,970
is github.com slash md n slash rather

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,650
compact data browser comp that data

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:49,280
separated by hash and those lying things

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:57,170
yeah my brain has just gone you're 40

00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:59,390
now you're having a senile - so we have

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,280
all that information in structured JSON

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,530
files and then we just use a macro to

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,940
splurge io into the different MDM pages

00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,880
I probably want to do something more

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,040
like that for this set up as well and

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,120
[Music]

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,890
first of all because it would be a lot

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,590
easy to do math updates and things to

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,470
the information then if it's instructive

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,850
data secondly because it could then be

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,380
used in all sorts of different places

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,350
you know as well as it just being useful

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,580
at the end you know for example again

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,780
taking reactors in example you know the

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,510
reactor core team could just come and

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,070
say hey we'd like to create a website

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,420
that specifically shows all of the react

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,620
best practices and they could just grab

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,930
the data and use it there as well so

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,440
it'd be like a useful place to have it

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,210
as a reusable data and also thinking

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,160
defensively it would be also a lot

00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,570
easier to remove if it turns out this

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,310
project is a complete failure and

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,340
doesn't work so I could just basically

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,810
remove it all using one call rather than

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,950
having to go around and edit hundreds of

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,630
pages which is something we've

00:12:51,950 --> 00:13:01,010
historically had to do far too often an

00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:05,780
MDA so yeah so that's kind of my little

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:08,690
elevator pitch and I guess at this point

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,820
I could take questions so any any

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,410
specific questions or ideas about

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,310
different subjects to cover or anything

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,310
else yeah

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:34,800
like I guess soup hello so I guess

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:39,120
basically one requirement would

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,350
definitely be having the availability of

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,180
a team that would be prepared to write

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,709
most of the documentation so one thing I

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,540
have to say straight and straight up is

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,940
you know the mdn team is so busy doing

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,260
web platform stuff that we don't have

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,180
time just to write a little bit stuff on

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,040
our own so we'd probably act more in a

00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,959
kind of advisory capacity in terms of

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,079
helping get the documentation up there

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,490
and reviewing it etc etc and we wouldn't

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,620
really have that much time to write it

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,300
wholesales but so but that's that's

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,070
that's why I've kind of domine in a way

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,320
we we treat these bits of document

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,820
documentation similar to how we treat p5

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,709
bugs in that system which is kind of you

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,540
know documentation which would be good

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,730
to do but it's not in our remit so we're

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:18,720
not going to do it kind of thing but and

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,490
I mean in particular with the IMS see

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,980
any pub 3 communities I basically sort

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,140
of set them off with a a core team of

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,700
documentation writers and just help them

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,899
get their stuff written and reviewed it

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:39,000
for them and made sure the structures

00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:56,160
correct etc etc following oh and we'll

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:58,350
do that it would be fine if it will be

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,520
imported yeah if they wanted some you

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,810
know maybe maybe if they have their

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,130
documentation somewhere but it's not

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,510
looking so good and they just want to

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,209
use kind of in the end structure and

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,100
stuff to make it look better and make

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:09,540
more sense that I would also be ok but I

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,430
do want to make sure what we don't get

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,490
you know documentation updated in two

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,490
places but yeah ok at the back there

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,920
[Music]

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:51,480
you know DreamWorks they're just

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:58,080
concerned around like what what it means

00:15:51,480 --> 00:16:00,270
for new developers coming from yen over

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,310
like what is the standard what is what

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:15,510
you know what is it Web API versus like

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:17,910
you know so that is a really great

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,140
question I mean then this is something

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,800
that we do have to be very careful I

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,690
suppose my kind of short answer to that

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,010
is you know if the sort of places where

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,900
we didn't where we did where we would

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,700
include the information just in context

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,580
I you know a JavaScript reference page

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,250
that's got some react best practices and

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,540
some angular best practices or where but

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,830
the primary audience for all of the

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,800
reference material is kind of

00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,000
established when developers or maybe

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,170
perhaps not call them advanced but you

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,900
know definitely not beginning web

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,040
developers that have been more likely to

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,330
have a bit more of that historical

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,710
context and but at the same time that's

00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,450
not a given there everybody will be in

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,270
that situation so we probably would have

00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:00,750
to have maybe some sort of little

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,310
information circle but you can just get

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,230
a tool tip that says you know these are

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,670
frameworks love of Lara and maybe learn

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,460
more about what frameworks are is a

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,620
little link to a piece of common

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,330
information about that and in the case

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,430
of the beginners information you know

00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,740
that would definitely be very clearly

00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,180
stated you know or all the beginners

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,040
information I write has a kind of you

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,510
know when you first get to it very

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,340
clearly says you know this is what you

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:27,270
should these your prerequisites for

00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,830
reading these docs and you know please

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,940
go back and read these bits first if

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,230
you're not really clear on them just to

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,260
make sure that you understand the whole

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:36,480
kind of situation so but yeah you're

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,810
absolutely right is there a serious

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,810
concern

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:52,630
that is cool then okay welcome at your

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:59,050
hello Blake from okay so do we have any

00:17:52,630 --> 00:18:01,330
other questions so since we're at the

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,290
historically nodejs clapper or something

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm wondering the kind of framework like

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,910
for things right guys that are in common

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,310
between node and the web there aren't

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,520
just JavaScript like set timeout or it's

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,620
kind of in common I just checked I know

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,940
I mean it's great to have node

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,190
competitive the year for that one

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,050
there's there if we wanted to document

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,120
it then we might have a section that

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,890
knows differences do you think this kind

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,790
of stuff would be good for Indian yeah

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,530
absolutely

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,690
this is the kind of stuff you know

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,670
exactly the kind of stuff that is

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,650
slightly tricky and obvious and trips

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,420
people up with some sort of regularity

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,120
that would be perfect for these kind of

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,980
best practices and tips or whatever you

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,490
want to call them so yeah you do you

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,980
have any like if it's important it's

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,330
cool that ever like how far down just

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,210
got that effort because I think a lot of

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:57,790
different JavaScript environments have

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:59,110
set timeout functions and is you making

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,670
smaller frameworks which is sort of

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,360
makes the project have a broader scope

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,010
in it would've expected yeah this this

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,140
is the thing I've I haven't really

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,030
played so much of the scope yet I'm just

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,500
kind of at the moment sore casting

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,660
they're as wide as I can just to see

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,360
what might make sense kind of thing and

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,240
then you know before tool I'm probably

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,250
going to arrive on some sort of sensible

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,260
scoping which will only just true to

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,370
remain sane while I'm trying to kind of

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:31,690
Shepherd all of this stuff yeah so yeah

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:34,240
there's me not I suppose for smaller

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,380
frameworks I was kind of hoping to just

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,450
experiment with having little

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,130
documentation resources that though I'm

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,840
kind of like my web related section

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,380
along with things like I only see any

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,730
book 3 and but of course there is the

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,500
chance that they would also want to put

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,140
little best practices throughout the

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,510
pages as well so I'm guessing probably

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,100
what I'd start with would just be to

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,380
start with the

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,840
the best practices stuff and probably

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,580
maybe start with one existing major

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,110
framework that popular and obviously has

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,610
a lot of users so would be a good sort

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:15,910
of low-hanging fruit place to start so

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:18,880
yeah cool so I was trying to think about

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,380
what I might like to see from like a

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,420
description of frameworks like way to

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,690
what I can't find on the Internet and

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,180
one thing that I often come across is

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,310
when I'm choosing between frameworks how

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,730
to choose what very word for what job

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,140
whatever and so you can always find I

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,490
mean there's a million articles always

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,170
talking about the differences between

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,060
frameworks but they publish articles

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,950
that aren't like you know don't have

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,700
this ability to contribute to them or

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:49,630
update them and and Wikipedia also

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,830
doesn't really do like it and we the

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,240
other place where this is it's kind of

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,710
like you might think you might find

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
something like this I'm looking at like

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,830
the destruction of the framework what

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,840
it's good at but it's bad at while you

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:03,070
might use this one over this one and you

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,560
don't really find that there either I

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,850
mean each framework look APA just like

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,130
totally different it doesn't have like

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,800
that same like format that makes it

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,670
easier to compare maybe you something

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,870
like that would be cool on MDM that's

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,160
that's really cool you mentioned

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,450
actually that's that's not the first

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,460
time that's been said to me today

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,380
oh yeah obviously there's quite a lot of

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,600
interest in this nicely thank you I mean

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,360
I suspect I'd probably put that kind of

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,790
article as part of the beginners tool in

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,790
kind of yes of module Docs you know just

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,560
like you know this is frameworks and by

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,420
the way you'll come across a whole ton

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,770
of them and here's the advantages and

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,420
disadvantages and we could just sort of

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,750
make an effort to keep that up to date

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,040
and you know cuz like this this is

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,160
another thing I've started this year is

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,690
the idea of the M this this has been the

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,080
year of maintenance which is kind of you

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,280
know not not the most obviously

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,420
awesomely cool project to work on that

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,000
you might think but it's interesting

00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,470
just if we've done a load of their kind

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,030
of archeology I namely and just to try

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,350
and find a little really outdated stuff

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,930
and work out with us

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,610
update it or get rid of end up taking a

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,990
lot of pages that are important to us

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,180
just to make sure that they're the best

00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,760
they so we definitely include Freck the

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:32,230
framework stuff in that regular

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:34,560
maintenance people do contribute in

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,090
different ways of suppose like I think

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,450
with with the beginners tutorials people

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:43,270
tend to contribute a lot in kind of just

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,430
fixing grammatical errors reporting

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,530
things that don't make as much sense as

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,940
they should you know just so that's

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,600
that's also really useful you know the

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:55,480
idea that we we try and write a stuff

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,800
those free of idioms or slang and things

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,030
as possible just to make sure that it's

00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,890
understandable for people who perhaps

00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,840
English isn't their first language so

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,840
that's always useful feedback to get

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,450
like somehow some way that it's clear

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,450
that people should contribute with this

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,850
yeah that's always a challenge yeah we

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,260
we have this joke on the team of kind of

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,700
like every year we stay shall we just

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,410
make the edit every year we'll make the

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,620
edit button five pixels bigger and move

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,300
directions you see actually what point

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,010
the critical mass right people actually

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,010
start looking on the damn thing yeah

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,350
because they you know and I was saying

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,950
this is somebody else earlier like II

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:52,030
the problem you tend to find in terms of

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,530
contributing to something like mdn is

00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,000
you know that the site has a lot of

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,310
gravitas in the industry therefore you

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,290
get a lot of people you know know next

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,810
I've known kind of known experts in

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,520
various subjects but I know would have a

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,280
very authoritative voice and be great to

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,530
edit thing a or thing they come to me

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,760
and say well I've noticed this problem

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,020
but I don't feel like I should really

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,250
edit it because I don't know if I'm

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,390
really supposed to or whatever and I'm

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,090
just like that's amazing like these

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,500
people that are absolutely you know

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,960
honest experts in this in these

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,060
particular areas and on the other end of

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,470
the scale you get the dunning-kruger

00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,650
effect come into play and people just go

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm just gonna go and start destroying

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,690
your life would you please stop please

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,790
please

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,880
so and it's very rare that you get in

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:57,880
between the song sense forming between

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:59,860
anyway more questions okay somehow I

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,740
don't know how they pull issues and like

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,590
into the in line which is a nice thing

00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,630
of like here's a way to kind of go see

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,410
what's happening on get over on whatever

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,850
platform you're using inside of this and

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,500
like kind of have as your comment

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,990
section except have it be in a useful

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,170
way that's like issues mm-hmm so that

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:23,800
might be something that's interesting

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,960
that we are we've toyed so often with

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,930
the idea of having some sort of comment

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,450
section or yeah you know old-style wiki

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:34,300
help pages or whatever there for people

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,280
to contribute but again we decided not

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,170
to because we're so short-staffed in

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,910
terms of you know can you imagine the

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,610
amount of stuff extra maintenance that

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,410
would open up yeah in actual fact having

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,300
it regulated in some way like it of

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,710
issues attached to pages or something

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,900
I'd be quite interesting in fact worth

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,460
long term we're aiming to move like the

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,130
whole of mdn just over to get up

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,780
completely just as a huge set of

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,250
structured data because it will be so

00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,050
much more useful in so many ways but

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,450
there for the moment we're stuck on the

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:11,650
archaic wiki's that work again

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:13,090
like we could you give the we could what

00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,990
are the issues that I've been having for

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:23,890
a long time is trying to use talks

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:25,990
offline and you know this is my some of

00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,760
the things that have been realizing so

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,480
doors are tools like docks I own that

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,090
made this possible for pages dark sorrow

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,520
is basically what it does is its crates

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,870
website and

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,980
it just came out that you can download

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:43,290
in your browser except and I felt very

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,570
good about that because now I can I have

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,790
this 49er flight and I'm disconnected I

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,130
can still accept I realize it you know

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:54,000
that actual library I don't have to das

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:57,300
board because I forgot to create no J's

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,040
directory and like try to peek into the

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,840
UH the no modules border and like scrape

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,559
the information out of the park now

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,340
readme files and so I was like yeah I'm

00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,470
just gonna make a making package for

00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,809
this so it can be installed actually and

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,820
it can be used on flying like a

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,490
documentation of this particular package

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,640
the next time I use this they realized

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,710
that the format is super complicated for

00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,230
for making this like scrapers it

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,710
monitors tripping all the information

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,809
out which actually comes back to you if

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,450
we would start pulling in the

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,970
information like what they would

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,610
probably want freiburg offers itself to

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,740
contribute that documentation in Kiev

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,800
which kind of raises the question is

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:51,750
there going to be like Andean format or

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:55,260
like how are you gonna try to like it is

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:58,020
raised I was trying to standardize some

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,700
of that you know documentation for that

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:06,600
things beyond that big guys that people

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:09,360
can like make a innovative to make it

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,510
easier for framework authors to

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,800
contribute that I mean it that's that's

00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,010
that's a very good question and pretty

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,630
good point I mean them so in terms of it

00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,580
depends which bit of dock you're talking

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,429
about really so in terms of you know

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,350
documenting a small framework on this

00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,030
web related section I'm talking about

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,920
those there's already established

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,010
formats for things like API Docs and

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,070
stuff that they can use and in terms of

00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:38,220
me like the framework best practices

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:41,130
that I want to dumping appropriate parts

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,230
of mvn pages and this is why I'm on

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,840
about using some sort of structured JSON

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,880
format just to write write them into you

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,710
know to try and and this would require a

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,289
bit of playing or

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,450
you know the kids'll get a few different

00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:56,710
people from a few different vendors

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,850
involved and just say you know what

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,500
let's try and break this format and

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,820
improve it and see how we could make it

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,130
work as well as possible but different

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,330
people then the idea would definitely be

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,640
to keep these different best practices

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,289
fairly short and if there's more

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,059
information if as if there's a whole ton

00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,190
more information about a particular

00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,630
thing that you want to get across you

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,860
probably just want to summarize it in

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,149
the actual best practice and then just

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,190
link out to a separate blog post

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:21,770
somewhere because otherwise the pages

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:55,580
that just become chaos so we need to

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:59,720
think about and it relates to me like

00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:07,929
frameworks like there it's like I feel

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:10,340
like Square and you know I think her

00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:16,760
thoughts are like there's there's no

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:20,840
standard at all whatever right they all

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,600
have changing others like constant core

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,409
questions like it means like the rapid

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:33,340
speeds like reverberation is kind of

00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:36,529
like it's at a conflict with a pace that

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,320
you know but the peace I think in

00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:42,649
bandwidth for your team inside I'm

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,779
curious like I just I really introduced

00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:48,110
to cut the driving factors were her like

00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:49,970
you wanted me because I think there was

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,669
public there I'm sure there are lots of

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:56,360
clear driving factors and I'm curious it

00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:58,010
kind of shift your driving factors off

00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,419
of them Vienna and maybe playing a

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:13,329
separate thing because I you know I mean

00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:16,629
you know for me it's just like it's it's

00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:18,219
totally reasonable opinion there yeah I

00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:19,719
mean this this this is why I'm talking

00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:22,179
about it being some sort of a separate

00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:23,529
structured data things that we can you

00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,209
know kind of create whatever we want out

00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:27,940
of it and have it maybe in some sort of

00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:30,239
standardized format and would also be a

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,099
bonus side-effect of that as well and

00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:34,239
I'd quite like it to still that we could

00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,419
still have it in a way that would allow

00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,769
me to kind of just take useful snippets

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,119
out and put them in place as an NBN

00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:44,320
that's obviously where I started from

00:31:40,119 --> 00:32:22,629
but I mean I'm certainly in favor of

00:31:44,320 --> 00:32:25,269
exploring that what I see from your

00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:27,999
document is that what I hear from you as

00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,739
well is that keeping with the spirit of

00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:32,019
Indian and helping people really learn

00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,129
and understand where the eyes want to be

00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,589
able to give them the relevant

00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:36,969
information that might be information

00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,899
that might be relevant to the frameworks

00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,969
were already using

00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:41,799
so that they can better utilize they yes

00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:44,169
they're seeing and using and when I

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:47,139
think about in the end one of the most

00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:48,729
unequal type Indians might preferred you

00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:50,969
know I like to be free schools with

00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:56,139
whatever is well but using any

00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:58,059
non-indian it's true and the way that I

00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:00,219
encounter Indian documentation is

00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,169
typically when I'm stuck I'm searching

00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:04,119
because you guys have any rentable

00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:06,070
domain authority you know you're at a

00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:10,779
very top of the results page typically

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:14,079
and so I agree that specifically if you

00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,310
already said it yourself but you know it

00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,160
would be duplicating where

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,660
try to have documentation for frameworks

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,580
maintained in two places which is

00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,370
basically a magnetic and what I hear

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,080
from you is that you want to be able to

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,360
have these tidbits of information easily

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,130
discoverable and in a way that reduces

00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,410
the maintenance overhead for you and

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:35,290
also puts it in a place where people are

00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:37,450
useful or is useful for people and that

00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,730
you're stuck on the wiki style so that

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,170
can't directly change but I think one of

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,080
the most useful things that you have is

00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,770
links link ability within Indian you

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,360
know I

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,370
everyone's gonna fall down a hole right

00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,220
learn so much I didn't know it's there

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:53,800
by following links on your site so I I

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,160
would be I really liked we're talking

00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,660
about full reviews and being useful to

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,690
people at all different levels

00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,010
essentially so I think something like an

00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,440
article where the difference between

00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,600
JavaScript and ojs that would be one

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,790
super helpful to a lot of people and to

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,800
with your domain authority it would be

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:15,510
very discoverable so I think that and

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:19,380
also specifically it ages well in that

00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:21,580
that's not going to change as rapidly as

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,010
you know like react coming out with a

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,720
new version etc etc so I think maybe it

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,720
would be a good place to start might be

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,899
having like a landing page for a

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,570
specific framework like say Indians

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,280
react tips or whatever and maybe that

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,350
would be where the structured data would

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,520
initially live it was like you know

00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,440
here's a bunch of tips that have been

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,149
contributed at cetera and they can link

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,250
you out to other parts of the website

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,200
and then maybe potentially once you get

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,120
it figured out you can pull in those

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,640
those tips into those relevant link

00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,810
pages and I feel like that kind of

00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,970
content with age really well especially

00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,679
what you were saying the differences

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,990
between different frameworks because the

00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,820
domain Authority Indian has that would

00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:03,130
be I can don't have a lot of people and

00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,950
it doesn't change nearly as fast as the

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,690
actual API frameworks and most of these

00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,610
maintainer zone these smaller frameworks

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,070
they likely don't have the time or

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,020
desire to maintain Docs in two different

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,730
places so you can figure out a way to

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,680
make that easy listen have the whole

00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,270
length of the G something I mean Indians

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,770
all about the content you have these

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,740
different pages about different things

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,240
and then each page has a bunch of

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,890
different ways that it relates to things

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,690
it's the exact opposite of what you're

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,819
describing and the

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:34,359
sort of a merrier for new people to

00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,190
write in the articles because at least

00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,160
this is my experience in trying to get

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:42,490
tc39 people to do the right things on

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,530
Indian yeah I mean baby they just take

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,660
time to learn this format but this is

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,910
like the entire point of it so like

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,250
having a single page eventually there's

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,660
no real point in having it be on Indian

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,880
the point of being on and being is that

00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,920
it speaks to two different articles and

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,300
the JSON I thought the tooling that you

00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,710
described sounded like a great idea I

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,339
think it's something a great idea to

00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:06,160
it's just until that is set up and in

00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,050
place I think that it would it would be

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,579
easier to maintain for the people

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,670
contributing the stuff as well as the

00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:15,040
Indian team if they were I mean it

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,630
doesn't have anyone you see problems if

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,390
someone does sit at the infrastructure

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,670
are you like Lana no I'm saying that I

00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:24,300
you know I would be happy to help try to

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,770
contribute some of these articles myself

00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,410
and that seems like a more reasonable

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:32,890
like chunk that we can take on then

00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,030
rather than trying to go and what I

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,099
would love to see the image serve you

00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,869
guys can come up with I mean it's

00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:40,720
certainly a reasonable concern what

00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,160
you're saying and I you know part of me

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,839
sort of sits there and things yeah be a

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,500
hell of a lot less effort just to do on

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,849
your say I quite like both approaches

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,170
that I could see what the sort stuff

00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,060
you're saying would actually live very

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,829
well in this kind of beginners to wing

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,260
kind of thing I'm talking about creating

00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,060
and and it might be like a lower

00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,190
maintenance place to start while we do

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,140
get some of the tooling set up so I

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,220
think both approaches could potentially

00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,650
work I mean another thing that you've

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,250
kind of alluded to and what you said is

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,079
like I talked about having these little

00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,480
tidbits away we're going to call them

00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,750
strictly speaking in in context in

00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,310
appropriate places but things don't

00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,660
necessarily have to be on exactly the

00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,420
right pages for people to just go and

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:32,560
find them because this is the web you

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:34,839
know mostly I'm into that idea

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,490
specifically I just want to just just

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,710
put out there to that like I agree that

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,970
duplicating than full duplicating

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,970
documentation in two places

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:47,200
sure I mean I mean that's that's why I

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,850
deliberately want to keep these best

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,170
practices deliberately very small so

00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,280
that we can just link to other places

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,550
where the stuff is covered in more

00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:41,170
detail so who's next

00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:53,770
you're the very excited trying to get

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:57,460
the frameworks in touch or coroutine

00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:59,350
yeah for routine library is like look at

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,710
all these cool decomposed generators and

00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:05,410
it's like here's the MVN way right so

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:08,950
it's it's about green culture of like

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,410
link back to MTN when explaining a web

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,720
api and then there's a way to scale that

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:17,290
up even more which is actually for

00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,320
cooing I'm using a base to mix we can

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:24,310
very easily take the library parse it

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,650
figure out what features it's using Auto

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:30,250
add Docs to the source code like if we

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:33,119
want or the readme or whatever like make

00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,119
