um thank you for coming folks initially

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,710
when I proposed this session I had no

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,110
idea what we were going to talk about

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:12,059
zir idea I just knew that there are a

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,549
lot of people in Vancouver who wanted

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,960
again tourists and for a long time they

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,550
didn't have a resource for it and then

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,769
eventually they did but it was just by

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,529
accident that we started doing something

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,189
for them so I'll get into that

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,410
my name is Manila on the internet and

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,390
usually keyword new I work at envision

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,190
as a developer advocate and I'm for the

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,079
passive well I've been like involved in

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,239
open source and I'm really liking it and

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,760
I personally got into it somewhat by

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,520
accident some people I've talked to have

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,200
actually experienced that and I think

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,789
that's kind of a shame that people have

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,300
to find it by accident when you can get

00:00:50,789 --> 00:01:00,739
so much out of it so like let's kind of

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,739
yours that gap um another smaller game

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:13,820
yes great so first what we're gonna do

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,100
we are and they're trying to figure out

00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,780
what brings people into open source and

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,479
then we'll go over a couple of things

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,610
like background for this project and

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,520
resources that other people might need

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,700
but that's what I want to get a feel for

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,770
in this room just see where people are

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,290
coming from people I have had

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:39,390
discussions with folks most recently at

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,460
Def Con in Tokyo where this this person

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,600
gave a talk would really get insight I

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,030
think you know I'm the person to make

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,680
Ruby and mentioned that everyone has

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,140
their own differences for getting to the

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,030
source which makes it unusually tricky

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,630
to figure out what appeals so cheaply

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,369
and I want to see what if anyone here

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,899
who's willing to share their motivations

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,909
for getting into it I'll get started

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,740
when I got into open source it was kind

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,500
of soon after I started becoming keying

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,590
at the bokor and my path into becoming a

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,900
developer was I used to work in a

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,640
different

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,920
industry and I started getting involved

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,019
in the developer community in my

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,310
hometown which is Vancouver

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,430
it's my hometown for the past like

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,709
decade or so and the community was very

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,720
helpful for me to get involved like

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,790
become a developer which made me just

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,370
kind of look for more my past to become

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,420
to be part of the broader tech community

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,540
not just like in my city so I started

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,790
exploring and someone invited me to note

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,629
school and then someone invited in old

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,720
school to node Interactive to conference

00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,819
and then someone invited like that that

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,500
session into the collapse of it so it

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,359
was just a step of like steps of

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,680
accidents of people just saying um do

00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:59,680
you want to comment like okay sure

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:07,389
thank you anyone else have something big

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:14,500
larger okay this plug-in is for P and we

00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:18,400
keep a PHP we can engine that I ended up

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,160
needing in order to build the website on

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,669
University Department because by doing

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,129
that I had not possible to deniability

00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,409
that I did not have to be an assistant

00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:36,209
on any of the courses that they were

00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:36,209
teaching then it sort of went from there

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,340
so initially you're solving your own

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,560
problems

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,840
yeah absolutely it brought other

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:52,540
benefits I'm sure eventually it becomes

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,479
a habit it's certainly easier for me now

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,120
when I'm working for I want for as a

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,430
consultant developing now with the same

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,790
client for about a year and a half and

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,780
with a couple of other clients and it's

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:10,419
easy for me these are finished companies

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,040
but they are internal private divorce

00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,829
that most of what they do but

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,829
practically everybody I managed to find

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,829
bits of things that make sense for me to

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,000
to release as open source and I've been

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,880
able to sell that it took the

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,860
corporation say yeah you is

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,020
more worthwhile 'full use for this to be

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,980
open source than for you to try and keep

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,090
it all to yourself

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,280
right so there's actually like for you

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,040
there's good business arguments you oh

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,330
yes - babe yeah okay there's effectively

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,520
you can if it's not that difficult to

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,530
attract back or if you actually build a

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,200
useful thing and have someone else use

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,050
it then even just one or two github

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,090
issues that someone files in externally

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,210
can you can point it they will say see

00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,970
this thing now makes your code better

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,160
and you did not have to pay anyone for

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,650
it and you know you're getting a slight

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,980
benefit and it's so far from what's your

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,610
actual business that it doesn't matter

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:30,490
for your native method negatively for

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:32,770
your income oh I was learning I'm just

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:36,610
learning JavaScript at that point and I

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,690
would read the code over and over and

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,010
over trying to figure out what the

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,690
different connectors or the different

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:46,330
platforms Facebook do were doing that I

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:50,800
found some typos and comments or

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,900
whatever and I I think that I think

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
probably my first couple of florists or

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,190
the fix it was or something but we're

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,420
reading the code I got more familiar

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,950
with it I consuming a bunch of code and

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,560
eventually you know I got I got to meet

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,730
some people on that project and when

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,620
slack released a new event API I know

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,780
how I know how to do this now for the

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,300
code so I went and implemented it and

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,410
but not and cinah me I'll push it over

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,510
as a pull request and it's totally

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,420
terrible and they took in they clean it

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,460
up and they merged it in and that was

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,870
the first time when I was like there's

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,870
other people using code that I wrote

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,280
and so it's like very different reasons

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,730
for getting into that we just heard

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,610
three and to me that sounds like

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,950
different reasons to get included in to

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,650
start participating open source I think

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,360
with so the reason we were talking about

00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,620
this is because in Vancouver we've been

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,420
running a workshop and it's called

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,790
getting started open source it's an

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,060
in-person workshop that we do and it's

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,940
basically people come and the mentors

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,770
and there are folks with stories very

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,330
similar to this we all have different

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,800
reasons for getting involved some been

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,350
involved for less than a year

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,210
some have been involved since I you know

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,720
some people have been coding since like

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,670
you're really young that that sort but

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,860
everyone just wanted to put something

00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,960
into the community where here's this

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,910
resource that if you're curious or you

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,620
had questions or you weren't sure where

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,150
to start here's this in person in place

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,440
you could show up to basically the

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,450
reason people go to meetups so we

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,790
started doing that in the summer of last

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,790
year I'm sorry I'm going fast food like

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,680
we kept the session short coffee break

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,090
and y'all go get your puppy but we

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
started doing that workshop last summer

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,150
and we thought okay we'll see how it

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,770
goes for the first couple of months and

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,480
we will do it once a month and we'll

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,610
keep signups for those who can have a

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,170
good discussion and maybe some people

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,840
will show up and if not we'll just like

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,120
you know try our own issues while we're

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,680
there all together it was kind of like a

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,580
social sort of hangout but from the big

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,470
first month it was already kind of like

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,910
we had a waiting list like people just

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,860
show up

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,720
you have the usual meetup like half the

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,390
number of people sign up show up but we

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,310
always have a waiting list which showed

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,390
us that there was an interest in at

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,430
least in that city for getting some

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,080
information in front of people that they

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,360
might not have access to by just like

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,020
randomly staring internet or taking a

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,550
chance on a quote on a project where

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,190
they have no idea how they'll be

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,440
received whether they'll get the support

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,410
they need to to level up from making

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,000
like one small typo fix to actually

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,490
putting a little request that like

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,970
deliver feature or helping them run

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,310
event

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,840
his dependable project you have you

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,440
could have down code encodes like

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,720
coachman so we started off by just

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,220
making ourselves available and answering

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,230
questions which were like kind of like

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,360
here's the myth of open sources it's a

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,670
person coding and no one ever meets each

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,500
other and it's just awkward stuff like

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,850
that and we're like no there is other

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,920
ways you can start there different ways

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,570
to contribute and depending on which

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,700
project you contribute to like for

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,040
example the larger get there are more

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,160
than just code ways like code channels

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:31,630
community and we weren't sure what the

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,600
efficacy of this would be like whether

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,960
or not folks to take this information

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,310
and eventually like because that ideal

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,280
outcome as they go and commit to a

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,840
project and we weren't sure and we don't

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,090
have hard data yet but we do know that

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,890
there are some people come back after

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,320
making convinced er projects including

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,760
those and they say hey now they want me

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,710
to follow up and make this other pull

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,400
request how do we do this

00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:59,590
which is really really good to hear one

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,860
of where attendees actually went to the

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,070
code and learned which is noted

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,690
Interactive's

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,940
like they give you a simple commit to

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,320
make make it you get your PIN and then

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,760
that supposed to cuff start you like

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,530
down path like committing one where I

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,270
got my start there like that my first

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,790
commit was there I had one of the

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,320
clothes marked so one person went to

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,980
that and I think since then they've

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,840
contributed least two more so I was

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,250
hoping something like this would help

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,340
them come together the conversation

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,980
started on if this was something that

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,110
other people wanted to run in their own

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,520
town or if you wanted something like

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,410
this to happen in your hometown

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,300
what kind of resources would you want to

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,790
give the people who are going to

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,339
organize this so someone reached out

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,220
from Austin and the they had attended

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:50,650
one of our community committee meetings

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,839
and they find out about this project so

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,500
they're like well I think you have a

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,230
slide deck can we use that okay slide

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,120
deck but what else would you need and

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,530
they talked about a curriculum so we

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,420
actually started putting together create

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,100
limbic

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,290
touched on a lot of what we had

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,649
discussed we hadn't brought curriculum

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,720
life and we thought a there are some

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,070
common questions maybe we put something

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,220
together and we run through these each

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,449
time we do our meetings that worked so

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,730
we thought hit what if we split this up

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:25,029
into three sessions that we just repeat

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,519
so month 1 2 3 and then reset start

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,860
again that didn't work so well because

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,259
some people would miss the first one and

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,819
have no context for the second one so we

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,680
just recently went back to every month

00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,089
is its own standalone thing but people

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,529
still come back even though they know

00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:41,500
there will be repeats because we

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,470
deliberately keep 50% of the time for

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,430
open discussion so even if we cover

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,380
similar items that get NPR's and how to

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,630
not like how to write communicatively on

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,980
github issues because even if you use

00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,069
github in your org you don't necessarily

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,610
communicate using it very well at least

00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:01,959
in my experience people just want to

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,329
talk about different stuff the reason we

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,190
added CI and continuous integration to

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,930
what we talked to people about or what

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,279
we introduced was because someone asked

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,740
us about it and then another person

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:16,149
asked about it like two months later so

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,709
yeah I wanted to open the conversation

00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:19,269
up to what people might look for in

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,519
something like this would you want to

00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,470
see this in your own town and if you

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,360
wanted someone to organize it what would

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,760
you be looking for in a resource I'd be

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,690
really interested in learning about the

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,810
curriculum and some of the resources

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:45,399
that you guys okay

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:47,139
personally there are a lot of people and

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,079
having that curriculum to work through

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,220
since you guys to be tested in a bit I'd

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,529
be really curious about learning more

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,959
about that would you

00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:58,300
at this stage having contributed already

00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,760
to open source like projects would you

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,769
mean so I'm not saying that you should

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,360
run I'm just saying isn't at this age

00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,910
will you be comfortable with the idea

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,420
like yeah I feel like I can shoulder

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,430
that you know responsibility of like

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,630
yeah if that ask me questions I can

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,439
answer it from the point of view of a

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,970
maintainer like or do you think it takes

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,380
is there a sort of barrier there well

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,660
I'm not sure I would classify myself

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,820
specifically

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,210
as a maintainer more of a contributor to

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,860
public use projects okay but personally

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,770
I am I'm gonna tell people I don't know

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,770
the answer you know but what I hear from

00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:38,370
what you told me so far about the

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,690
workshop you created it sounds like you

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,240
know you're showing people that open

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,440
source software is community like that's

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,420
that's what I'm getting out of it

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
essentially there could be you know 50%

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,680
broken discussion 50% for kind of

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,480
teaching and walking people through that

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,280
sounds good I would I would show up to

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,140
that just because I love to meet ups and

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,880
it would be great to have that community

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,170
to spend more time with other people

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
that are interested in open source

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:09,240
mm-hmm whether they're noobs or whether

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:12,800
they're people that I don't know how the

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,600
other chapters are but noted school one

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,400
reaches the point eventually where you

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,540
know people have kind of made their way

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,790
through the curriculum they still like

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,080
that so like it's socially so look every

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,730
month yeah there's not necessarily so

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,100
like this sounds it's only it's like a

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,250
natural progression of how you keep it

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,770
interesting for like somebody should be

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,460
quitting top killers right for the

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:40,620
morning comedian interesting said

00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,870
because we actually for purposes of

00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,110
budget we actually do it a true note

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,850
school IBR yeah because to make it I

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,390
mean just from I feel like when I see

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,390
people doing

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,830
I'd be interested in the curriculum and

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,650
we need something so you're talking to a

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:04,440
general audience about contributing to

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,360
general open source right yes but there

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,250
are lots of smaller or just getting

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,260
started with such projects that could

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,690
use these materials with some really

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,860
strap themselves like okay here's a

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,020
template for how people should

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,990
contribute to our project why are we in

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,030
bed not from the beginning yeah and a

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,950
lot when I see a lot of this project

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,850
like what is something project that I

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,220
admired you I'm gonna do it that way so

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,630
this then becomes a resource for

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,820
projects to attract more help

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:45,210
okay well when Tanner Burnett is

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:47,250
so and also like a big just TV yes oh my

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:50,160
goodness have to make a template if

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,850
she's oh my goodness I have to like come

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,230
up with a set of tags I have to do

00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:00,240
office space with paperwork the biggest

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,990
realization is going to skip Boyle times

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,430
but it also leaks it that if you skip

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,360
all of that only people who already know

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,810
what's going on contribute because they

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:34,820
already have the cultural knowledge

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:34,820
whereas if you want or the idea was

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:13,170
actually fine so I like the idea a lot

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:23,040
of mentorship so I'm actually the point

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:26,240
is they can drop up truly for the fact

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,240
that they're not getting paid for this

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,780
we do something because you're using it

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,320
really intensely and then these topic

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,320
and that project to use it anymore yeah

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,550
we we have found a lot of people will

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,640
come and figure out

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,470
hey this not for them but that's to be

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,060
expected not just with open sores that's

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,360
to be expected with like any sort of

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,860
like Ian person where child and maybe

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,450
the format doesn't agree of them which

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,620
is why sometimes we have it's great to

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,420
have these discussions where your

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,590
suggestion for mountain and we can

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,330
actually iterate on what we're doing

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,830
maybe we're not doing something as well

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,060
as and we're also yeah I'm very common

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,620
look like that we're very short of time

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,380
and I wish this discussion could

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:22,630
continue more so I'm wondering like all

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,370
the people here I think the best quality

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,290
probably didn't move forward on this is

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,830
if you're still interested and somehow

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,530
continue the conversation async say

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,870
participating in discussions or maybe we

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,060
will come up we'll post our curriculum

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,260
somewhere public and you can actually

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,430
look through it and make suggestions

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:46,870
change it if you want to do that I will

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:51,460
move this to a document we can drop some

00:18:46,870 --> 00:19:00,040
way to share that with you I don't know

00:18:51,460 --> 00:19:02,830
why my that so if you go to that it'll

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,050
take you to a page where you can either

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:10,780
sign in or you can continue as guest

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,460
okay you can you can you can ping it you

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,690
can write it down if you want to and I

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,470
can take a piece of paper but that's

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:19,470
totally yourself yeah because I know

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,770
yeah I'm 20 have time for question I

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
don't mind missing okay I just didn't

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:41,650
want to impose that on other people so

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:44,010
yeah Creek Elam because I know that's a

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,540
way to meet a lot of books you tonight

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,650
no I mean coming from my background I

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:55,210
don't like to do a lot of stuff in

00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:58,240
person because the environment and but I

00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,640
think and I think that if there's an

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,350
emphasis on non code contributions you

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,900
are reaching out to more

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,220
diverse set people who work in tech even

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,140
deaf writers pay on stick with people

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,140
you can contribute I'm just curious

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,700
that is totally in the curriculum mainly

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,559
because when we first started we put

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,630
together a very simple set of what do

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,630
people think open sources and what about

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,150
that do we frequently have to tell if

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:29,970
people is wrong yeah and that came up

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,970
very early on because when I got started

00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:50,159
with exposure like in the beginning of

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,010
[Music]

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,470
some community I can show you and

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:35,200
clincher it somewhere but as they start

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,020
to go on sometimes they will lose that

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,970
motivation anything happen most of the

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,530
times when they are not actually eating

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,659
that project if you are content wherever

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,750
we spend most of the time in the

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:52,510
technology and you start to try to

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,669
contribute to a movie or maybe we'll

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,650
make up to take something but we will

00:21:54,669 --> 00:22:02,140
lose motivation at the end yeah so

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,539
people will realize is forest products a

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:14,049
should start it just start with some

00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:15,970
projects and then for every specific

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,580
person needs us

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,800
very like specific projects which they

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,790
can be in and completely credibility as

00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:30,280
a a and that's the point where it should

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:33,850
realize this part of a completely open

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,550
source you can technologies recharging

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:39,160
the front-end back-end may be obvious

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,200
you can look on those technologies to be

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,820
using will happen always you will have

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,910
the information and you will have to

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:50,470
compute to the project you know you know

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:53,950
the people that's the thing so here we

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,020
need to like look into the also as so

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,320
chance you're part of your question

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,440
we do offer ourselves as a resource so

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,230
the mentors in that workshop we happen

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,810
to contribute in the JavaScript space

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,270
not all no jest to node.js one runs a

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,570
framework like it's a rest framework and

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:18,580
talk with node and another person who

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:20,230
worked mp5 yes but what we do try to do

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,120
is we try to make ourselves available to

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,340
answer questions where it's like you can

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,080
bring this if you're interested in a

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,510
project you can bring it to us and we'll

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,750
help you identify a way to get it so

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,070
it's like oh maybe this is a good way

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,530
because they're very responsive if you

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,970
have if you try to contribute like

00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,260
documentation shapes but they're not so

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,350
responsive nature try to contribute

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,300
features it's easier for us I think to

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,520
notice that kind of is we have other if

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,810
if you're an open source for a little

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,820
while you might start up some cutters

00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,290
and translate across projects and that's

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,720
another thing you do is we help people

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,640
identify including mutual contribute so

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,230
if it doesn't have for example that it's

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,030
partly for the conduct and it's not

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,890
enforced at all you can see that in

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,890
their discussion we don't recommend

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,950
people like go there and we try to

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,220
explain why because sometimes that might

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,840
not be immediately obvious but another

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,820
thing I do want to make clear is that

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,820
what we're trying to solve for is

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,820
lowering the barrier of entry we are not

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,980
necessarily trying to create motivation

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,710
to contribute to open source what we're

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,540
trying to do is on this lunch end that

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,140
you have the motivation to convene open

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,460
source

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,170
we're trying to lower the barrier so you

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,210
don't know where to go after we were

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,710
fixing that plant like I want to

00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,300
contribute and then we're trying to

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,490
create that path from I wanna contribute

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,260
to I am contributing but if we don't

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,090
have a motivation to contribute that's

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,620
okay because you know like people do

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,880
stuff they contribute for Juan de Luz

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,920
and really move on to the different

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,330
technology inlets that's finding them to

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:56,320
accept but that's just the nature

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:58,540
people's time most of the time like

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,460
everyone in the community has at least

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,290
contribute to do some project maybe a

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,480
type of something but the problem is

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,570
that most of the difference is not but

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,390
if they think this is so awful sometimes

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,950
because you don't defeat the first

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,580
barrier but after then they don't know

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:18,550
yeah I did first thing no I see so he's

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:24,400
an estimate is the main problem thirty

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:27,460
point is relatively easy any - like

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:38,770
first step is very easy the next step to

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:41,440
go and that's where you lose the I might

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,750
misinterpret it the recurring nature of

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,750
the workshop and I heard from and got me

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:49,000
excited if you know I I learned to code

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,260
in a challenge that had I learned a lot

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,260
from my local tech community

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,770
smallish town in Florida is like a

00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:00,880
college town but you know we still had a

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:03,790
small text me and you know I like my but

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,320
within that scene we had meetups and all

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,610
that but there really weren't that that

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,370
many people that contributed open-source

00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:14,170
and you know you were speaking about

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,000
motivation people once they do get over

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,160
that barrier whatever barriers exist for

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,410
them to get into my I totally see issues

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,930
is like 100 percent non code

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,550
contributions has like an incredible way

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,380
to contribute open source is depending

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:29,260
on the project is you know low barrier

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,050
it's awesome but for me having that

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,450
social aspect of just paint come

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,680
together will maybe give some talks like

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,170
this would be more of a meetup thing

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,420
online distant talks and education and

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,880
then you know people just work on open

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,920
source

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,600
or disgusting or whatever I was

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,430
interpreting it as more of like people

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,310
being able to come together and have

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,260
that social aspect I think that that's

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,480
what keeps people motivated in my

00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,190
opinion is you know open source is

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,570
community in a lot of ways they hear the

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,940
kind of person where you can find that

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,010
community easily online through your

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,380
online persona then it can really help

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,970
you keep motivated but if you're just

00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,800
the person who wants to try to gain that

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:12,650
habit you already like it you know

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,450
whatever I feel like having a recurring

00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,980
event where people come together and

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,720
work on whatever projects they're gonna

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,450
work on Venus suddenly pitches you a

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,340
project whatever but that's really

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,950
satisfying to me to think about bringing

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,530
that social aspect which I think makes

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,930
the source so successful but bringing

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,850
that into a real life space which I

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,580
think can be more welcoming to other

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,480
people essentially and you know when

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,490
there's something to stick with a

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,400
project or not you can't control that

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,780
but even just getting people to enjoy

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,090
that process because it open source can

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,770
be a such a toxic place that you know

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,780
unless you can associate some food heels

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,670
with it somewhere somehow and even if

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,240
that's just having a beer or whatever

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,950
you're doing with your friends you know

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,630
filling out issues or fixing bugs or

00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,400
whatever yeah that's a that feels really

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,880
powerful for me it's the kind of place I

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:06,800
wanna go here just like this yeah it's

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:10,910
just like this about everybody in the

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,010
deaf community it's like created things

00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,100
when I first had computed nontraditional

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,450
under it I was like this is a bug I'm

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,270
not going to touch it cuz I don't want

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:28,250
to put myself out there and like that is

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:29,570
a big yourself or you have maybe some

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,900
impostor syndrome where you have all

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:36,890
these other things so not everybody like

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,360
gets over that first hurdle or maybe

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,640
they get over the first hurdle and then

00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:46,010
they have a terrible experience because

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,110
that happens that was our having that

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,930
that's in like real life social do you

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,090
me like people suck in mmm but you know

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,180
like we want you to be here the very

00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,680
least

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:04,010
yeah thank you for bringing that up

00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,260
because like we I think it's a projects

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,740
responsibilities to make sure that they

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,510
are conducive to recurring like two

00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,300
divisions and they're supportive and

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,980
helpful and that's why we try to be very

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,680
careful about recommending working

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,030
places go we will not actually call out

00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:27,160
like say you should contribute here

00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:27,160
totally yeah until we know for sure like

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,539
yes

00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,539
