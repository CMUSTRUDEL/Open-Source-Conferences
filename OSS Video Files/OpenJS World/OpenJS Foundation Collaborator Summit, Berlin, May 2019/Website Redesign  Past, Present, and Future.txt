Level-setting

* Pace of progress picked up quickly, would be good to see if weâ€™re still functioning well
* Recap of the process so far and future plans.

Introduction to the machine and improve onboarding docs

* Workshop to get new people on board. We're not teaching React/Gatsby. We're teaching people about how we implemented nodejs.dev
* In the process improve onboarding docs
* Nice to have: Get good first issues in the issue queue and use as walkthroughs

Collaboration

* with core docs contributors: How we want to tackle API docs
* with i18n: How to best consume localized API docs"
