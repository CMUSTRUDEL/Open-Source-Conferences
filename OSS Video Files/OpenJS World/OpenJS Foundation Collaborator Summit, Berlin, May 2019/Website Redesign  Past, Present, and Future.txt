More details: https://github.com/nodejs/website-redesign/issues/155

Level-setting

* Pace of progress picked up quickly, would be good to see if weâ€™re still functioning well
* Recap of the process so far and future plans.

Introduction to the machine and improve onboarding docs

* Workshop to get new people on board. We're not teaching React/Gatsby. We're teaching people about how we implemented nodejs.dev
* In the process improve onboarding docs
* Nice to have: Get good first issues in the issue queue and use as walkthroughs

Collaboration

* with core docs contributors: How we want to tackle API docs
* with i18n: How to best consume localized API docs"

um yeah I'm Adam I'm chairperson and run

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,969
the website redesign project I work in

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:22,170
LinkedIn full-time as I run the design

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,500
system over there I guess anybody I was

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,689
there

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,830
hi I'm journey Microsoft I do a lot of

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,469
things ago I'm trying to do Morgan's I

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,660
mean yeah I can give a little bit of a

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,309
quick brain dump because a lot of us

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,010
have context here for let's say we

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,719
designed it all kind of talk about where

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,690
we've been where we're going what plan

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:52,820
is what's next so started year ago now

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,260
um with us trying to figure out what uh

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,350
what a website redesign might look like

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,260
really wish I could share because start

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,080
out with a couple medium posts for me

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,990
this epic length you can go find it do

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,340
we look good yeah yeah grab an issue for

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:19,680
us to go in second drop links trialled

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:21,960
open let's go over to the nodejs slash

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200
website redesign repo we're gonna pop

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,860
into issue just closed it unfortunately

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,619
just this close yeah Juden awesome we're

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,840
gonna go open to issue 155 and website

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,060
redesign i'll drop links in there so

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,390
that we can like yeah i'll look at stuff

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,899
together

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:47,270
um blue of sharing so it started out on

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:52,380
a medium a good chunk of time about 59

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:56,090
155 yeah um with this kind of epic

00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:02,670
length article I posted a while back um

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:04,799
called redesigning no js' part 1 yep

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,149
so if you're kind of just a competitive

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,730
analysis a whole bunch of other websites

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,650
similarly in the space so this was I

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,680
[Music]

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,900
in scala and the NGO website it's kind

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,659
of picking what's good what's bad like

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,159
that we didn't like and from that kind

00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,140
of came up with an information

00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,579
architecture idea or how we can improve

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,709
the current website went through and

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,689
reviewed all the current contact stuck

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,519
it into place there was a lot of

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,069
conversation online with the existing

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,019
website team and with a whole bunch of

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,370
new folks talking about information

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,040
architecture and just making sure that

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:48,470
all the content fits into there and then

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:52,500
from there put together a vision board

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:56,310
with a whole bunch of link I just

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,470
dropped in the issue as well which is

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,359
kind of like a scaffolding of how the

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,260
websites gonna look a few questions like

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:08,340
it's not gonna be blue it's just for

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:13,319
structure and like information yeah

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,180
information structure and then we want

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,629
to start getting started on building

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,859
something made a few technical choices

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:25,349
and had the pleasure of working with

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,849
miles who got a deal with Google to get

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:32,730
us the domain nodejs dev we spun up a

00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,620
new dedicated code repo so the repo that

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,470
you're all looking in right now is the

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,419
website redesign repo there's also no

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,340
js' slash nodejs dev which is the kind

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,340
of code repository let's talk about

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,840
unifying the two but opted to keep them

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,479
separate website redesign is kind of the

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:57,690
admin repo and no ji dam is the Kohen

00:03:51,479 --> 00:04:00,690
repo but no guest dev is the home of dev

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:04,199
you all go there you'll see a page that

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:08,069
looks very very similar to the learn

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,199
page on the envision board so we there

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,229
was a requirement for launching about

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,829
that domain as part of the domain launch

00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,329
that Google was doing it was a

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,150
requirement that you have to have some

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,310
kind of content up there that is not

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,400
just a copy or a leader X of some other

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,669
content

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,259
[Music]

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,789
you're not projecting might as well yes

00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,159
so we need to get some content up there

00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:39,020
so we kind of took the layout of this

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:41,330
this wireframe turned it into the site

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,650
you see it no gets out that if you go

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,759
take a look at the repo it's a ghastly

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,479
sight

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,389
so you'll page about split it's an

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,110
awesome framework for building

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,340
documentation and kind of pulling in

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,919
content from a whole slew of different

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,960
sources and I'm missing right we have a

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,409
wonderful co-worker of mine at LinkedIn

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,389
is a developer turned designer he works

00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:09,169
on the designs team with us he's been

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,800
acting away on new look and feel since

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:15,919
he got involved let it go it's finding

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:21,439
ramping up project ended probably ended

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:24,349
so he's been dropping design board

00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:30,319
updates in the website redesign meeting

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,909
issues we opted not to half the last

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,460
meeting

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,620
barks ago the cloud summit because in

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,750
transit but if you look at the last

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,839
meeting issue that is open in there

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,759
there's a gift that he posted up it's

00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,979
some of his latest work that he couldn't

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,210
act away on so we're gonna have full

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:51,919
fidelity mocks soon from him but there's

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,779
a lot of work that needs to happen in

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,889
the meantime like we have a we have a

00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:57,020
site that's up a door anyway outside

00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,710
that deploys automatically when you

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,699
merge into masters awesome but we kind

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,900
of have to start thinking about how to

00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:09,830
wire up data for the rest parts I think

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,099
as far as ia goes we have a good

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:17,120
direction to work with here and there's

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:19,099
some pretty well scoped out sections in

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,810
the site to start tackling next that's

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,569
kinda I was hoping to take this session

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,460
to focus on you know make some technical

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,250
decisions around how we're gonna move

00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,419
forward with API Docs page the releases

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,880
page you know all this and you can start

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,259
actually opening fine-grained issues

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,689
that we can divvy out and treat it's

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:42,529
kinda like after planning session

00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:45,799
the next few months they are before me I

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,819
guess dive into all that I think I

00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:57,769
suppose someone bring up before you get

00:06:46,819 --> 00:07:00,019
into nitty gritty the question um I

00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:03,409
think the hope is once we get content

00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:08,149
parity um we will approach the website

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:09,469
team is aware of this and werewolves are

00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:12,199
so exciting and proposed essentially

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:13,550
switching over the site so the hope is

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,249
the content that's currently on node

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,629
guess then we'll move over to org and

00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:19,159
then we get to have the fun conversation

00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:22,519
of what do we do with the depth domain

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:29,119
now like can we just make it a mirrored

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:35,719
version you know people but I think

00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:45,079
that's still my guess would be that's

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:46,909
not going to happen but yeah that's the

00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,519
hope is what we're doing you become the

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,889
new site you know we worked pretty hard

00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,429
to like go and track down a whole bunch

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,339
of lead pages inside figure out what we

00:07:55,429 --> 00:08:06,369
didn't need anymore what we had to

00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:10,339
doesn't make sense of where salvation um

00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:11,419
well we can love to dive in and I should

00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:16,399
start talking about someone's nitty

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:19,039
gritty we have do people who aren't from

00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,829
my compound products or do you learn the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,289
technical products of Joseon related

00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:40,729
products do you have any questions or

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:43,159
concerns specifically yeah there's a lot

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,600
more I want on this this learn pinch

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,649
like right now it's just we had an

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,829
amazing donation from Flavio Gomez for

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:52,759
getting started guides dumps tired and

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,370
you buy it to mark down that he

00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,480
published in their dominant right but

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,309
there's a lot of more like advanced

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,269
content I won't get in there and there's

00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:01,579
actually a lot of guides

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,740
currently buried them the note the

00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:06,019
current site that would be good to

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,360
figure out what it didn't push em where

00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:12,170
they can't go delete those engines yes

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:21,160
these guys really don't ya know are they

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:23,689
in their stuff yeah what's the function

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:29,360
what's these so eventually the nodejs

00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:31,399
they're actually the new old website

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,300
once it reaches feature parity or

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,750
whatever is hearing so the domain the

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,029
content that will be that is on there

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,069
will be basically transferred up of

00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:45,110
transparent yeah so it'll be saleable

00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:48,819
and it'll replace it yeah their current

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,579
content and that domain will probably be

00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:54,920
the teeny bit but then once that side we

00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:59,089
keep here I want you so much my name is

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,459
so what is the goal currently the site

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,920
like is it a playground to experiment

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,809
with new new things or whatever or is it

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,040
a place for I see the learning 8

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:12,709
prominently featured in simply future

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,279
yeah so the the dev domain it's kinda

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,269
like a staging like we can get out in

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,679
the world get feedback

00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,480
keep iterating on it I guess my question

00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,839
is it is the goal of the website

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,750
redesign to get a modern architecture

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:33,679
set up or the site or is it to provide

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:36,470
something yeah yeah so it's a ground-up

00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,240
rebuild of the current site and a

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,670
reimagining of a lot of the content so

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,740
the current site does not have any

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,769
getting started resources how to learn

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,500
note have you I think beyond downloading

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,319
a binary like so there's there's a lot

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,629
of content in use cases that aren't met

00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:57,709
by just the API Doc's take just the big

00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:59,600
old download button and it's we're with

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,199
the learn pages from the internet we're

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,830
getting closer but there's so much more

00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:09,620
content

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:13,070
we didn't act including you know I am an

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,910
SRE pop-up note in production I'm doing

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:18,350
perp analysis so my my server how do I

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,870
inspect under the hood to see what's

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,310
going on you know these these advanced

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:27,770
guys that there there are a few floating

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,080
around on the ground website the advance

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,570
guys looks like but it's really just

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,450
kind of the guys right yeah it's just

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,180
kind of a hodgepodge of what what folks

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,130
in the deep in the technical side have

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,470
decided that they want to write I mean

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,510
it's it's also three years of technical

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,520
part of our website those are temporary

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,820
ones so yeah that lip service temporary

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,400
and it's not been temporary I'd really

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,920
love to actually take a make a conscious

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,500
effort to tell a story with the

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,850
documentation that we right now and you

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,220
know think about as somebody coming to

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,280
the site with this use case how do we

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,770
introduce them from zero to the most

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,160
advanced use case so they can get up to

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,830
speed as fast as possible instead of

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,910
just relying on kind of somebody has

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,200
this top of mind they're gonna write an

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,010
article about it this is just another

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,870
feature and then forget about it it's

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,900
actually quite hard to find the guys on

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,930
the curbside knowledge base knowledge

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,580
base yeah yeah they're old some of them

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,900
are renovated um a lot of you some TLC

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:40,370
so that's that's kind of the hope for

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:43,400
the learn page and you'll actually see

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,650
on the the envision board that the learn

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,630
page doesn't back up to different

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,980
sections like this right not just

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,300
QuickStart advanced guidance on there

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:58,490
and believe on the actual live dev site

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,540
itself it actually we can go to sections

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,000
like that we have Quick Start and

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,970
getting started but you can imagine and

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,100
this might include some interactive

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,840
interaction changes like how you do all

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,490
the articles and everything but you can

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:17,260
imagine that there's a there's a section

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:17,260
for sorries or process introspection

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,320
there's a it so there's there's a whole

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,769
bunch of different stories we developer

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,930
different

00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:29,139
that's what users come and learn and

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,139
actually get this pretty common with you

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,320
so that's a that's a section just ap

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,660
they're just documentation of content

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,220
learning page content is a pretty large

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,440
mute still like we have enough there

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,240
that like if we got everything else on

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,430
the site switched over and like I have

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,199
content barony like I'd feel pretty

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,519
comfortable switching over with the

00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,709
content that's there right now just the

00:13:49,519 --> 00:14:15,230
things are getting started study but we

00:13:51,709 --> 00:14:19,100
can make it a lot better so something I

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:22,420
really wanted this site to the sector

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,920
the enable was was to let people manage

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,620
documentation where they think it should

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,300
live so like this thing will is gonna

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,399
start showing API Doc's at some point

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,470
API Doc's should not live outside and of

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,790
course cuz nobody will update them if

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,040
they don't let nobody well I don't know

00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:41,899
what else to do that yeah so this the

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,089
site has this prerequisite of it has to

00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,130
be able to pull content from across the

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:47,959
project stitch it together like I don't

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:51,800
I don't want the community page I don't

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:55,279
want that content living outside will

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,860
never look that otherwise so the nice

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,889
thing with gatsby's you can kind of set

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,839
a dependency on anything in stitches it

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:10,430
together so yeah I API Doc's a kind of a

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,440
special little beast because we all this

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,540
stuff also need to get translated so

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,550
we're working with the

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,639
brute figure out how like what their

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,480
what their publisher coat looks like

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:26,420
artifact they just that again and we

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,800
know that so this there's a lot of

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,410
outstanding work there we're kind of

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:35,420
waiting on it-- and then to get there

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:37,820
we had a concession yesterday we can

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,950
figure out how that's gonna work but we

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,680
also get to figure out how we were not

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,420
blocked by that in the meantime it's

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,950
like for the NDI not specifically right

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:51,140
now every version of every json.parse

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:54,920
file in the API Doc's folder just living

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,930
currently deployed on org so good like

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,320
first first-pass integration we can hit

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:04,390
that up like it says an API just go

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,100
fetch the JSON as we need it and

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:09,350
rendered on HIV see fit

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,380
so there's link baseline work in the

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,540
site right now

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,210
API Doc's just you know we don't have a

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,520
whole bunch of design yet for it but

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:25,280
there's a lot of data work just hooked

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,680
up I'd love to see like a good strategy

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,840
for the first of procures like we we

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,780
always bake in the latest release into

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:37,810
the sign itself gatsby server-side

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,810
renders for initial initial page render

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,850
but it would be nice if those like the

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:49,310
current LTS a guy Doc's were faking the

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,950
site so like we get that benefit though

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,600
it's always loaded Google sees it

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,490
there's just a static page when it

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,320
renders but then if you might go look at

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,290
historical documentation we can have

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,760
that hosted Sunfire ended up like an API

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:14,150
so it's not part of the bundle you know

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:14,600
we want to bake in every that's how we

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:29,510
do it

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:31,430
LinkedIn is every version of our overly

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,470
complicated for the note site

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,450
so there's technical decisions to make

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,220
around you know how we design that heli

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,350
wire all data together that it's

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,960
non-trivial and we can do without a high

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:46,769
fidelity design so

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,049
but an actual one used to releases right

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:54,029
yeah I I really want to figure out a

00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:56,820
good way to take a look at the envision

00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:59,159
board there's that entire releases

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,970
section now pretty prominently displayed

00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,369
with that extra download options and

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,940
hopefully a better communication model

00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:10,549
for the release process it's it's kind

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,710
of hard for new users to drop the

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:18,570
release flow and I love I amber does the

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,159
best job of describing their release

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,080
process that I've seen so far

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,600
keep illustrations for each release line

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,149
and give you a pretty nice illustrative

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,059
guide of how that all works I'd love to

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:34,019
make that very nice yeah I'd love to

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,730
make that for the for the node the node

00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:42,749
site as well somewhat less cutesy but

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,220
equally clear but we have similar to the

00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:49,429
API Docs like we have data integration

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:54,480
needs for releases as well like below I

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:57,450
kind of envisioned that below the like

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,990
top three LTS current nightly download

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,749
options stop and this kind of like small

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,369
description the release process I think

00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,700
descriptions down below yeah I know

00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:07,710
right

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:12,330
this isn't it it's like the best for

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:15,860
these documentation it seemed yeah

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:21,539
like it makes something that's pretty

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:23,850
dense like approachable no reason might

00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,830
ask to be danced down below the

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,950
envisions kind of like infinite scroll

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:34,710
searchable this table exists elsewhere

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:38,460
on the node side very also similarly

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,519
posted in a giant JSON blob pretty sure

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,639
some ground gorg freedom for everything

00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,169
every release all right yeah like

00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:49,470
there's data work to be done to pull

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:53,309
this in and like layout the page this is

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,509
another vertical of work where we can we

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,990
can start integrating data and getting

00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:59,020
functionality in there without a

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:04,140
final design to work off of like if we

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:06,550
just kind of code to the wireframe yeah

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,490
but there's kind of that outstanding

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,370
question if it's is uh just having these

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,440
these JSON files just sitting out on

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,820
server I'm acting like it's not the

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,850
ideal way to do it there's there a

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,900
better way to integrate that information

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,380
like it works well for the first pass

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,900
but is it that just something better

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,270
that we could work with with build or at

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:39,760
least working group to have a better

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:42,010
relation one of the issues Ramona

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,390
discussing among the discoverability

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,780
oh the kind of issues which we searched

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:53,940
in that usually Stack Overflow comes in

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:57,309
the top then given the node.js slash nor

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,650
issue rapport comes up but not

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:02,730
necessarily the APA documentation the

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:08,260
green website only known that dot there

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:11,020
yeah so is it it's because the kind of

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,540
topic that is being searched is not

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:18,210
present author or should we have nerds

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:22,210
yeah should we add some semantic

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:25,480
capability indeed I don't know but my

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,580
experience is that discoverability is is

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,300
little bit lower on both the websites

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,860
yeah

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,020
manner should be at the chicken-egg

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,520
problem like it's not a it's not a

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,920
resource that people think people to

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,460
like if you're if you're looking for

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:42,400
help with a note issue that's not just I

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,400
need to know then you're gonna you're

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,309
not gonna link to the node website or

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,660
are they doing it up issue and so Google

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,550
knows like this is not a resource but if

00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,610
we if we turn the site into a resource

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,880
that that people want to use publicize

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,580
it or not that type of the the search

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,390
engine discoverability problem will

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,520
likely change yeah well of course try

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,980
and keep the best practices for all the

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,870
metadata for search engines to crawl it

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,180
and everything but I mean so right now

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,370
like part of that these are you know if

00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,120
you run the lighthouse test on the docks

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:25,240
that you guide us the SEO element is a

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,670
which is like a warning effectively like

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,560
you need to do better and googled except

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,910
like that's a very serious thing to them

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,360
it's like if you're not doing well

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,850
you're not gonna get ranked well get up

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,270
does well second or foot as well so if

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,440
we want to be ranked well we have to be

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,710
improving for that and as far as I know

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,620
there's never been any kind of search

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,780
engine optimization or like auditing of

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,770
certain elements inside of the Guide

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:57,460
Dogs to help improve that so you know I

00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:00,910
think I got to be tough sell a lot out

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,830
of the box yeah and then there's minor

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,770
tweaks that we can make like please say

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,260
one person can go and get us to honor

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,030
which is very nice and that should

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,660
theoretically just give us a flat

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:15,970
improvement on that and then you know

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,350
once that's done I don't think there are

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:27,970
individuals at Google who are doing your

00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:30,610
background doing a lot of work sure use

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,660
our Doc's as a way to you know case

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,310
study for your work

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,040
and I don't doubt that they would be

00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:40,080
willing to do that because it's a higher

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:43,660
backpack so help them succeed in how SSE

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,290
given me have a search box and one of

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:51,010
these websites which is basically doing

00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:53,500
if custom with with some yes Amanda

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,540
capability is actually I'd love to kind

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,030
of pick your brain a little bit about

00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,880
how we can improve the format of API

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:05,740
Doc's long term because right now it's

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:09,460
it's all in its it's somewhat structured

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,680
data yeah but there's the far better

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,380
ways to document it than just in

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,560
markdown files you kind of manually keep

00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:20,230
up to date with the code no there's no

00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,430
services like oh yeah yeah they would be

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,130
more than willing to give us their

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,940
service

00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,919
I mean there's just a ghastly has a

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,419
great ecosystem around it so they

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,630
actually they go Lea has a plug-in for

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:36,110
gas baby which we add it adds a guide ox

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:44,480
code search on the site it should be

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:47,510
fairly straightforward but I but that it

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,850
doesn't we can we can build a tool much

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,039
like the kind of a stand out I found for

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:56,990
API Docs on the sites I compared with

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:59,990
the Scala documentation where it's all

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,419
you can um let's get on what you'd

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:09,200
expect of a an API Doc's page everything

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:12,610
very broke library oh never mind that is

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,610
ugly as later let's go

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,840
was it Scala we were screenshots an

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:25,750
aerial um anyway it's all it's all

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:28,400
broken up beautifully and you're able to

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,530
search by by method or property here

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,270
then actually see inputs and outputs

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:56,929
it'll tell you how it relates to all the

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:59,360
other modules content creation so I see

00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,890
several please correct me if I'm wrong

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,870
I'm making a bunch of assumptions here

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,220
with everything but I see several

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,080
different tracks on which things are

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,730
moving and you know trying to figure out

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,830
where the blockers are and where I could

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,039
help you know remove some of those

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,720
sounds like you know there's the techno

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,280
technology of actually building this

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,230
phone you know which goes slow or

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,610
whatever just a design which I'll kind

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,440
of love them with the technology because

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,690
some of these people are working closely

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,610
together to all the tech the wireframe

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,289
and building it out there's the content

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,840
side of it which is obviously creating a

00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:31,669
content you want to see and then final

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,320
one it's likely because I've had

00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,179
disparate all this is and how it would

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,489
be drawing content from

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:40,669
committee's information architecture

00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:43,129
essentially in terms of you have all the

00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:46,039
content everybody produces two different

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:50,149
formats and standards technical debt fix

00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:52,009
all that essentially so that's one thing

00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:54,289
that I look at as is like if we can

00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:56,809
figure out a format to make it play nice

00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,879
with SEO and everything and markdown

00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,229
format or whatever that I can you know

00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:02,450
in depending on what y'all are doing

00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:06,080
like wrong on creating content or

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,309
tweaking needing to the so here where

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,729
are you like where your blockers

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:12,349
currently with things um there's there's

00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,999
three different three different blockers

00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:15,559
right now one is on the content side

00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,589
like it said like we can always improve

00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,849
content depending on where on the site

00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:21,889
you're looking at you're gonna probably

00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:23,989
get at the content differently it's a

00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:26,659
guy box it can be an oak or Conception

00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:28,570
markdown files if it's learn page Doc's

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:30,440
attorney lives in website redesign

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,779
pointed there the I think it's all

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,549
documentation bullet right there I've

00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:37,489
solved this markdown holds in it's like

00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:39,259
I was trying matter little blob it tells

00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:43,789
it how did this way on the I'm gonna

00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:45,589
learn page yeah presumably like releases

00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:47,919
page well we just be a hard-coded page

00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:50,479
for the description of it in the

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,539
documentation repo but it'll pull in

00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:55,759
data to show the historical information

00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,999
so we have we have completed the content

00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:01,460
inside of it which yeah it's need some

00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:04,339
TLC there's specifically you mean

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:13,519
getting that each book edited to look

00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:15,499
good format or there's just gas that

00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,330
would be play well with the site yeah

00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:19,330
you know I see that as white that's so

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,359
that's that I think that's the second

00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,940
type of blocker we have is we need to

00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,019
integrate with stuff they get to get

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,539
Sarah T yeah

00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,129
so the the second second section where

00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,229
we need we need a lot of work to be done

00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:36,889
it's just like we need API Docs we need

00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:40,339
releases information we need in a very

00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:41,690
human like a stud you know we have a

00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,889
whole user story section on the

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,690
Foundation's I'm probably going away

00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:47,389
that we'd love to get onto the site for

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,950
the host that information it was like

00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:50,480
that those beta integrations of

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,980
in new content in just getting basic

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,180
parity and then there's kind of the

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,910
lower-level link the structural work

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,650
like we need a way to like we're working

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,620
on the idea - no problem right now but I

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,130
just opened an issue this morning like

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,080
we need to get a knife in library like

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,910
to help our library for fur gasping salt

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,400
I pick one make sure it works based on

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,870
point is that a thing and it'll work so

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,580
there's like the the core instruction

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,760
for the site itself was it kind of the

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,170
three areas I seem that we need to kind

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,700
of drive forward and if all three are

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,920
any good place we'll be able to flip

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,050
switching turn the side huh

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,390
and probably the the place where the

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,460
most work can be done right now is the

00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:33,430
application content and the integrations

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,430
so like just to unblock the pipes for

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:50,780
what just has to be done to that I know

00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,980
this is like not to be rich what do we

00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,370
want to get out of the session what's

00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,170
the goal here yeah so my um something

00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,500
that another dude it sounds like we're

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,530
all kind a level set that like the goals

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:07,550
of what we're going to do long term um I

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:09,020
I would at least personally find value

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,000
and you kind of treating this like it's

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,540
like a sprint planning it's like that's

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,820
actually deep dive into holding API Docs

00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,650
let's get the project board set up let's

00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,030
make a bunch of tickets for the hello we

00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,260
can drive against over the next month or

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:26,800
so they get it and then we can treat the

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:31,490
treat our regular meetings like like

00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,990
meetings so we can do you take that

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,950
approach or the reason you're making

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,810
tickets anymore

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:42,490
um we can keep talking about you know

00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,490
our retiree visions for the future

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:56,230
so yeah that's kind of my vision was

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:59,890
it's from tickets

00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,890
ends at 10:30

00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:09,850
yeah I'm willing to work for the cops

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:13,090
right yeah anyway I'd like a bunch a few

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,360
things yeah I'll be in there making

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,889
issues or at least how I see how that

00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,249
work should go and we can talk offline

00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:23,350
about integration there but I'd love to

00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:25,059
keep using you as a resource or we

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,809
haven't thought about the releases page

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:37,419
a lot and I want to make sure that's

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:38,559
done them well and done right yeah what

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:43,320
type of content you'd like to see on

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,320
there and and we can get our designer

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:51,549
documentation folks that make it

00:31:46,029 --> 00:32:00,429
something that's digestible oh yeah

00:31:51,549 --> 00:32:19,509
that'd be great yeah that'd look up

00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:21,820
online those of you who are not

00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:32,499
interested in getting more involved if

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:37,450
you I know it's a lot of engineering

00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:40,929
work they're just especially if they're

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:44,019
better at going through doing like

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,789
self-guided stuff like basically you can

00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:47,409
come into this repo and do whatever you

00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:50,350
need to and like whatever he feels right

00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:55,029
and probably you know my name is on this

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:57,369
probably because you're gotta go yeah so

00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:59,590
you know that's a that's a thing and if

00:32:57,369 --> 00:33:06,220
you know people who are bowing or able

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:08,230
to do that any any Fernando to the wants

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,850
to get the injuries yeah and that's not

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,779
the thing who cares what no Doc's like

00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,580
yeah it's just it's a lot of front-end

00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:17,950
building right now we accept

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,840
to code out there so it's a great

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:27,430
opportunity for me Fernando sir just

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:28,990
