In this session, we will be discussing Node.js Collection and our Social Media Presence.
There are many things which need feedback and new ideas on how we can improve our process.

* How can we improve our Node.js Collection review/publish process.
* How we drive Social Media Chair initiative.
* How we can improve diversity/inclusivity in the content we publish.
* Which kind of feedback we should get from users regularly.

hello how many folks how many folks are

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,750
in the room just because I'm I'm remote

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,150
so I'm just hearing voices it's four of

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,090
us right now but I think it would be fun

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:17,279
because we just started so that's great

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:20,279
yes great um so um Molly did you want me

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,470
to kick this off or did you want to kind

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,660
of jump in and give a little background

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,590
here no no no you you can you can start

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,990
I'll just say my point you know if I if

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,920
I have some like you can start okay yeah

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,090
okay perfect

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,980
so um hi everybody my name is Rachel

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,399
Romo and I work with the open Jas

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,510
foundation and I am your communications

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:51,629
and public relations support for all

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:55,530
saying open Jas and and nodejs project I

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:58,020
am relatively new to the role um it

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,250
seems like I've been here it feels to me

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,219
like I've been in this role a little bit

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,320
longer than I actually have I just think

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,820
that's kind of the nature of the project

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,950
everything kind of moves pretty quickly

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,270
I've been with the Linux Foundation

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,960
since November of last year and I took

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,229
over for Sidney Keaton who kind of had

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,310
some of the stuff in motion prior to me

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,390
coming on board and really the purpose

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,310
of today's conversation and that's

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,720
really how I kind of hope this goes is

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,770
to get some feedback on how things are

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,549
running with the node.js collection and

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,140
how things are going with social media

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,960
specifically the the node.js handle and

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,540
the Facebook in the LinkedIn I think I

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,360
think we do get a lot of traction on

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,450
Twitter so I'm not only how things are

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,450
going but also you know how can we can

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,719
we improve and what programs can we put

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:06,110
in place and what processes can we put

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:10,080
in place to that that just includes more

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:13,750
more relevant content a more diverse

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,130
group of people you

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,260
and how we can just get some of that

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,000
stuff just a little bit more

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,790
collaboration on on both of those topics

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,120
so before I kind of dive into the topic

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,950
here just some background info are there

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:37,570
any questions

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:38,620
you know before I dive in oh I know okay

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,130
perfect perfect

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:46,390
so um okay so a little bit about the

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,130
node.js collection it is and I apologize

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,780
I'm not exactly sure who's in the rooms

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,730
I don't know how much everybody knows

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,670
about what it is and sort of the purpose

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,260
of it so I can be pretty brief and if

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,320
there are other questions I'm happy to

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,550
answer those questions um so the node.js

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,239
collection is a it's our basically our

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,620
community blog on medium and really the

00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:16,390
purpose of that is for people to share

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,030
technical content tutorial you know that

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,400
kind of thing some of the some of the

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,540
things that we are collecting today

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,269
some of the things that we want to talk

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,239
about on that blog today are things

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:31,930
around the community best practices and

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:36,970
how to cloud and containers Internet of

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,790
Things ai mobile and note course those

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:46,299
are some of the things that we kind of

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:47,980
would like to get topics on let me just

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,440
find your screen again here while I was

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:56,380
reading off the list there Meredith and

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,450
so typically how people publish today so

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,010
if you wanted to publish something today

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:07,209
we do have a medium email alias where

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:10,239
people will email in I do get pinged

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,709
directly as well but typically how it

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,620
should work as people would hit that

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:17,500
medium alias they would send in either

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,510
an abstract for like an idea something

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:26,140
that they want to submit or a fully

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,610
fully fleshed out post and then how it

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,629
should work is this group

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:35,560
of medium participants and editors would

00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:38,139
read it and kind of you know say as a

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,490
group house working today and I think

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,280
this could this is kind of part of where

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,930
we can improve we kind of say yay or nay

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,000
and it's you know some folks are a

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,469
little bit more available so you know

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,849
we'll get to not everybody's necessarily

00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:54,370
voting on it but it's you know we're at

00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:58,150
the all clear then I can work with the

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:02,740
the contributor to publish it's a very

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,729
it's a pre manual process insofar as you

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,690
know we're copy and pasting from

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,319
documents that they have into a word

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,340
document and then we're you know putting

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:17,409
it on the blog with you know it's kind

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,190
of I lined under the nodejs

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:25,449
foundation versus maybe by lines under

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,759
them with we obviously attribute it but

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:32,800
there are some things we can do to to

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,969
maybe streamline that process um how so

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,039
I'm just going to move on to the next

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:37,719
bullet point here if there are no

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,449
questions about sort of that review

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,979
process because if there's not I guess

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:47,020
my point is there's not much structure

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:50,259
around the review process um so after

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,120
that so how much time is this is how

00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:54,099
much time should it take to publish or

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,960
what's what's this trying to address

00:05:54,099 --> 00:06:02,860
here Wally um the second bullet so it's

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,199
nice um how much almost dying which is

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:10,779
like how many time do we publish you

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:14,169
know about oh yeah so yeah so um you

00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:19,839
know it it's really as work we're not

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:23,020
getting a ton of content today so you

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,180
know as far as like a best practices

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,589
standpoint I would say a couple times a

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,930
week would be great just to kind of keep

00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,539
you know just kind of keep the content

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:39,099
fresh and to keep people coming to read

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:41,409
our things you know the thing about this

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,599
is we can time it out you know they just

00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,509
because we get something on a given day

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,569
doesn't mean like we have to get it out

00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,159
that day and depending on what it is

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:55,479
doesn't necessarily have to go up that

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:57,909
week if it's more evergreen content so

00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,719
you know I think we could get much

00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:04,419
better at using an editorial calendar

00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:08,110
and get these things scheduled out in

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,399
advance and you know so it's you know as

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,289
far as the best practices around you

00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,459
know how often we should be publishing I

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,879
would say a couple times a week would be

00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:19,439
great if not it's not more I think where

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:23,439
we leverage the problems is what we post

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:26,199
you know a ton of stuff on one given day

00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,029
close together so even if we've got a

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,389
couple of things going out on the same

00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:36,339
day that's okay too we just have to be

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:38,829
mindful of the timing of it so how to

00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:43,889
become a reviewer and how to leave so

00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:47,889
today folks would just email that medium

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,529
alias and I can I can find it and drop

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:53,019
it in the chat here too of that helpful

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:58,199
and essentially what what what what

00:07:53,019 --> 00:08:00,490
we're doing is people are requesting to

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:07,779
requesting to become an editor

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:10,209
um and 122nd I'm describing that email

00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:14,589
address so if I keep referencing it and

00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:17,409
it would be helpful to give it in there

00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:20,319
okay so I'm yes I'm really just just

00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,199
request to to become one and we are

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,529
looking for technical folks to come and

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:31,389
help us review at this point we we don't

00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:34,000
have a process to to leave but that is

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,130
probably something that we should

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,779
address because there's probably some

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,870
folks who maybe their jobs have changed

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,979
or you know for whatever reason it's

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,009
just not something that they're able to

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:52,089
do right now and so I'm just so that we

00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:54,880
kind of I'm sorry today no no okay and

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,850
please again I'm on the

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,550
so I'm just kind of talking through

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,680
something if you need me to stop and

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,399
you've got questions just interrupt me I

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,529
will not take offense to it let me see

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
her so should we have a Trello board or

00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,750
something I mean let's kind of let's

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,910
talk about that let's I think maybe

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,480
there is another way to project manage

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,389
this a little bit more a little bit more

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:28,300
in a streamlined way I think that's a

00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:30,430
huge you know huge question and a you

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,230
know a something that we could probably

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,579
improve upon because then at this point

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,310
it's kind of just you know things like

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:44,079
things are coming in through that email

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,250
alias and you know unfortunately it's

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,949
one of those things where it could be a

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,350
single point of failure if you know if

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:53,800
it's not maybe documented somewhere else

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,790
outside of that email so are there any

00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:02,350
thoughts around you know having Trello

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:04,750
board or even just I know I know at one

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:09,490
point there was a Content calendar maybe

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:14,139
we could read it revive that yeah does

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,720
anyone have idea about such like a

00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,779
process for the

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,540
locals to many to the review process

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:25,959
github has you know Trello boards on it

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,930
now is there is there are you guys

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,149
talking about trying to schedule posts

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,160
specifically or just how to get them

00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,899
into the pipeline because I would assume

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,329
that they would be I'm John Church by

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:42,430
the way I think that's God speaking hi I

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,560
would expect it to be like you know

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,319
somebody submits a pull request to a

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,060
repository the way that the most of the

00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:50,560
committee's work and whatnot and then

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,199
that can be reviewed and marked down

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,019
there and other people could weigh in on

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,550
it etc is there a reason why that's not

00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,829
the way you guys are working currently

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,970
or am I missing something on that I

00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:06,040
guess so one point of not using eita

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,070
base that will you share ultimately or

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,529
medium because

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,670
reflection is on media so then getting

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:16,970
posts from deter video

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:19,399
yeah so yeah that can travel because

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,190
yeah I get up sports the default you

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,060
know that the markdown for me I can get

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,310
up here for the medium it can get bigger

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,230
so no we need to figure out like one

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,920
platform here we can settle down and

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,829
then yes we shall go on another reason

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,350
its blocks could be published elsewhere

00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:44,870
and we are just by the nature and by the

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:49,480
quality or by the relevance of it we are

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,480
just three posting it in the medium yeah

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,240
medium does have like a we don't we

00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:59,620
don't fully utilize it today but medium

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:06,050
does have a way for people to submit

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,769
draft for review you have to request to

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,699
become a writer

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:15,980
um and then that's kind and then you can

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:17,839
kind of go through mediums process I am

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,220
a big fan of doing it this way because

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,949
it kind of promotes repeat contributors

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,449
because you know once they are a writer

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:29,779
they can continue to be a writer at any

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:32,149
time something you know pumpkins they

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:35,630
write something interesting they can

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:40,220
submit it and then every editor of our

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,220
medium publication has access to all of

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,779
those drafts so really it would then

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:52,600
turn into more of a vs. it would be more

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,579
about ensuring that our editors are

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,399
either you know they were assigning them

00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:02,120
or you know basically that things are

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,589
just fitting in the medium queue so

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,370
there is kind of a there's a more

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:09,709
automated way to to use you know to use

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,579
the tools that we you know we kind of

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:15,769
have in place today and I've done it a

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:17,510
few times with with some up with some of

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:21,020
the folks and it works out really well I

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,060
think where some of the process where

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,570
where we would need to maybe put some

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:32,750
more process in places around assigning

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:34,220
editors and recruiting editors but so I

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,880
mean that that's that's an option as

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,709
well I don't know if you've got but

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,360
there's sort of more because I see that

00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:43,490
we took some notes run you know you

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,010
think github which i think is also a

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:50,870
good idea just because I know that a lot

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:54,589
of folks here use it use the tools that

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,839
we're already using I'm gonna sell I'm

00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:01,580
gonna be I'm gonna admit to the to the

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,560
group here I'm not a github Pro again

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,410
I've just started using it since joining

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,870
the Linux Foundation that doesn't mean I

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,060
can't well yeah that's um you have one

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,640
problem because not everyone is familiar

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,709
with the github and everything they

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,649
don't like or maybe someone does it

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:22,820
right some some things like some

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:24,740
technical blog or some stuff but they

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,470
don't know how to like submit it to the

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,920
open a PR follow through with the

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,110
details and updates so yet the the

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,089
Kanban or Trello style board I was

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,790
talking about on github those are

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,440
through I believe issues or they can be

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,060
they can be pull requests or issues so

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,220
you won't have you wouldn't have to

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,660
commit code but it it's it's a moot

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,029
point really I mean if you guys are just

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,649
trying to get a board for that way

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,910
everybody can see what's going on it can

00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,760
be Trello can be whatever people are

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,480
comfortable that's fine one question I

00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:00,380
have is right now so I work for a

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,810
company that we do we do training and we

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,870
we have a site called hey know calm and

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,940
we create written and video content

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,890
teaching people how to program in nodejs

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,600
so this could be something that I could

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,640
potentially you know help and help

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,649
volunteer with might be interested in

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,200
that with you guys you know looking at

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:23,089
what that looks like but I do also like

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,520
the idea of the medium with that people

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,649
can you know people can request to be an

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,839
editor or writer not an editor but a

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,540
writer on the medium publication and

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,040
they can submit their own things that

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,490
are published there so they can make it

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,910
look how they

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:40,430
and submitted that would maybe make the

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,770
flow for life getting putting out a call

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,930
for submissions might be easier but then

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,150
I'm curious about how then you need

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,620
somebody in place who decides what gets

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,500
published and what does it yeah because

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,490
if no js' foundation if you know if if

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,470
node says hey please submit your your

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,670
posts there's a really high there's a

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,350
good chance that you'll get submissions

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,370
and they might not be high quality so

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,220
that you need to have some kind of

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,380
standard in place of you know who

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,810
decides what gets posted basically I

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,330
don't I don't know how that works or if

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,150
you guys have clarity on that right now

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,980
right now it seems like the bar to even

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,260
submitting stuff to you is kind of self

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,250
selecting for you know you get a much

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,170
lower rate of submissions etc but yeah I

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,790
don't I don't have answers for that but

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,470
I'm just curious if you guys have

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,570
decided about like you know how would

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,320
you what's the bar for what gets

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:36,410
published on that publication on the

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,590
other hand Michaelson is do you have any

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:44,300
complaints coming about the quality of

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:47,090
the publications I mean what is the

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:52,160
motivation behind looking at improving

00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:53,920
the review process so so the I think the

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,310
question there is have I gotten any

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:05,570
complaints about quality and I have not

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:07,520
however I typically get I'm again um you

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,110
know I'm not I'm not I'm not a software

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,600
developer so I'm not I'm not super

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,880
technical when it comes to that so I

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,470
have been working with you know the

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,850
technical members of the review

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,010
committee to to make sure that it's good

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,110
content and until you know and that's

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,060
that's kind of goes to this next point

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:31,160
about you know more technical reviewers

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,900
because that can be a time intensive

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,730
process right

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,600
reviewing this stuff making sure that

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,020
it's technically sound it can take time

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,600
and so typically you know what I'll what

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,750
I'll do is I'll get either get you know

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,200
someone will submit something and it's a

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,119
trust

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,239
source or I'll go back to that medium

00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,100
email alias and say no hey folks I'd

00:17:56,239 --> 00:18:01,970
like to get back to this person you know

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,919
and you know a week's time can somebody

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,799
just take a look and you know let me

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,499
know if this is I know sums up or thumbs

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,039
down and that's typically how it works I

00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:14,779
think we could probably and I think we

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,239
could probably improve on that process

00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,419
as far as one getting more technical

00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:24,499
reviewers to kind of share the share

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:27,619
that workload and also totally open to

00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:29,029
giving those so credit because I

00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:31,999
understand the stuff takes time so

00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,649
whether that's you know footnote or you

00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:37,190
know a thank you at the bottom whatever

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:41,200
it may be but just really kind of

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,690
increasing that pool so that you know I

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,779
think it was John's is that your name

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,249
yes sorry okay to John's point like when

00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,249
we put you know if we were to cut out

00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:53,960
some sort of call for you know call for

00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:56,419
submissions we probably look at a lot

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,489
and you know I want to make sure that

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,289
this thing can scale so it's you know

00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:01,850
when people are submitting they get a

00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:03,789
finally answer whether or not we're

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,559
going to you know accept their

00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:08,480
submission and you know it could be the

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,799
accepted it could be we decline it and

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,179
give them reasons I mean those are kind

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,379
of things that need to be fleshed out as

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,149
well

00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:17,690
so there have been a couple of times or

00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,970
some things needed to be updated and so

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,220
you know we just kind of went back to

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,779
the to the writer and said could you you

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,759
know

00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,859
clarify one or two of these things and

00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,609
then they resubmit and you know that

00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:33,529
gets published but content you know

00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,840
takes time and content is an investment

00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:37,639
and so we would need you know obviously

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,119
know any quality content but we would

00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:43,190
also need you know the experts on the

00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,049
editing or on the review side to ensure

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,570
that we are putting out meaningful and

00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:51,379
helpful stuff from the community so

00:19:47,570 --> 00:20:00,660
that's what you know that's a answer

00:19:51,379 --> 00:20:04,530
that question okay

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,200
I - Aaron and so I come in a little bit

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:12,960
late to this discussion and I have a

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,700
question which is why so I think that we

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,330
all agree that there needs to be more

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,060
high-quality content about node and so

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,410
is there a target user that we are

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,480
looking forward to read this material

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,610
because someone just knew - no it needs

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,280
a different set of content than someone

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,080
who is in the middle of their node

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,710
career or someone who wants to become a

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,230
core contributor so yeah that yeah

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,570
exactly that's one of the point we want

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,360
to discuss and highlight that what kind

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,240
of content we want on the publication if

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,000
we can drive like three or four type of

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,430
channels one for like experts one is for

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,650
the beginners where we post regularly on

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,780
there should be like a topic for the

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,460
beginners every be equal with twice a

00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,460
week and then there should be a topic

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,500
for intermediate one and there should be

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:05,940
topic about like getting the reviews and

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,430
then yeah yeah how do we know do we have

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,980
traffic goals

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,110
is there a conversion goal is there a

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,110
sign up for a newsletter goal I think

00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,900
without a goal we won't even in the goal

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,060
can be like a purely quantitative goal

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:25,440
of life you want to publish X amount of

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:27,450
articles by time period but without a

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,430
goal set out it'll be really hard to

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,770
decide whether it's worth the effort

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,780
that you want to put into it and to get

00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,730
people on board because they won't be

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,310
able to go back and say I feel good

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,550
because I helped get to this milestone

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:45,200
and then the last thing I want to ask it

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:47,970
sorry to ask them any annoying questions

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,800
I actually used to run a small magazine

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,360
I used to work in publishing so like

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,590
these are the annoying questions that

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,500
people in publishing ask um there's

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,800
already a large community of people who

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,430
volunteered to judge content for the

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,810
various node and JavaScript conferences

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,970
what about using the conference

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,520
presenters as a pipeline because if

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,710
you're presenting a 20-minute talk

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,460
turning not talking to a

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:21,200
post is not all that much more effort

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:24,429
sometimes and so saying hey you're top

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,610
got accepted and you know unattractive

00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:31,850
let me connect you to the blog people

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,899
and so that's one way of vetting if

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,399
they've already been accepted to the

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,960
conference can we encourage them to

00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,820
write a blog post for people who don't

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,440
like to watch videos sometimes the video

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,509
is not very high quality or there's a

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,950
glitch and it's a different way to reach

00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:47,240
people that's not tied in and these are

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,809
people who have already signed up to

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,159
reveal no and they they pass some sort

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,259
of filter yep

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,639
which I I like that idea at least

00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,499
because there's efficiencies there and

00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:59,899
it removes some work and removes people

00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,940
from the process etc so really reusing

00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:10,490
content is a great idea and another

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:14,179
thing to do August is streams month

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,460
right and have put a CFP out like far in

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,740
advance they're like three months in

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,559
advance so you have an editorial

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,419
calendar that's about we want intro

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,480
content you want intermediate content

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:30,470
and we want like how to help content all

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:36,169
these topics and then just have a call

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:40,309
for papers I love I love that I love

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:43,580
both of your last two suggestions Wow

00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:45,529
like those will I will pop we will copy

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,509
and paste those into our proposal to

00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:50,840
kind of improve this those are wonder

00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:53,509
those are awesome thank you I do have a

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,769
question just not to not to and not to

00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:58,279
answer a question with a question but

00:23:54,769 --> 00:24:02,259
for the you said it you know for for

00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:05,360
things that are vetted already through

00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:09,889
like conferences are you talking

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,659
specific for look obviously we have the

00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:13,669
the interactive conference in December

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,740
tell me about that or are you saying

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,879
like there are I mean obviously there

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,840
are other conferences that are you

00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:22,639
saying to kind of do outreach to

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,480
speakers at those conferences and and

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:29,180
and fill the pipeline that way as well

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,950
right you can start it with the

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,660
conference that you have the closest

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:38,090
connection to you right interactive

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:39,980
right right look at the calendar of you

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,710
know JavaScript across the year reach

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,770
out to the organizers and say hey we

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,830
would love to feature your three keynote

00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,580
speakers on the blog if they want to

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:56,120
write a six to eight hundred word piece

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,890
about why they think up is important and

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,090
why everyone should know about it and

00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:04,970
then you get a tutor yet like the last

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:08,180
time I gave a talk at don't interactive

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:10,520
it was about all the array methods that

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,440
I love arrays right here's all the

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,240
things you could do with arrays I never

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,740
turned that into a blog post because it

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,460
was a Jupiter notebook that you can

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,960
claim it but if I were going to do like

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,650
another blog post but here all the

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,480
stupid ways to log things right then if

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,510
I was gonna do that talk if I got the

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,850
blog post out either around the same

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,090
time or just a little bit before the

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,980
talk it helps me write the talk because

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,340
they can turn the outline the blog post

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:46,760
into the top and then it's promo for the

00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:48,650
conference right that's right you're the

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,140
three main things you should know about

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,800
a raise or here are the five gotchas

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,500
when using array methods and JavaScript

00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:02,000
to hear more about this come to this

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,010
conference in here yeah but one point I

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,880
want to raise with that but if secure

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,770
already speaker on talk you can get you

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,770
get the viewers attention you get the

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:16,340
word out but like if you are new into

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:18,560
blogging you don't get a chance to speak

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,890
at a conference that does not stop you

00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,340
from attending a blog post or making

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,320
your contribution things like so we yeah

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,240
we can you can filter or we can take all

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,060
ways that could be the best scenario but

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,860
we should be always be open for the

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,200
newcomers who maybe who don't have a

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,990
talker conference but the post itself is

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,880
a nice and the quality of the content is

00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:44,320
good

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,390
I think mentorship works well it helps

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,020
with the quality bar know has usually if

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:53,380
you're new to both writing and coding

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:59,410
you need some help translating within

00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:01,809
your head out to the page I noted some

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:06,160
various nodes mentorship efforts going

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:09,070
on now yeah I'm wondering if it's worth

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:14,740
thinking about how to do no mentoring

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,510
for long technical writing as well yeah

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,980
I want to put something out there look

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,020
like that I some thoughts that I wrote

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,360
down while I was listening to all that

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,830
and when I was hearing from from you and

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,270
I loved I loved your suggestions

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,250
specifically one of the things some of

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,710
the things I heard from it was reusing

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,059
content is great because if the speaker

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,860
is already invested time they've

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,080
something to talk about and what what

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,630
you said about I'm sorry I don't

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,110
remember your name Lily yeah yeah well

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,850
delete said about not setting the bar

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,820
being more equitable and being able to

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,350
signal boost new people so that that

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,350
made my mind start thinking about like

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,990
one's very important thing is whose

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,090
mouth is this content coming out who

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:59,159
because there's we're gonna have to

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,020
review the content regardless but it it

00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,970
it depends on where we set that bar and

00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,370
part of it is the messaging around the

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,750
actual content itself in terms of is

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,650
this coming from

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:15,370
is this the nodejs you know folks

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,299
boosting user created content or is this

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:19,210
nodejs

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:22,030
stamp of approval this is a good idea

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,970
and that last one the bar is so high on

00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,799
that but I'm very lazy and I want to

00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,450
figure out ways to you know like that

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,460
there's so much effort and quality that

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,130
goes into verifying that and I don't

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,590
think any one person can decide you know

00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,260
what what nodejs would stamp with an

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,690
approval but specifically on medium and

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,820
specifically with collections the

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,110
workflow and what the pipeline and what

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,090
people are used to is typically

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:49,120
collections are ways to boost other

00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,090
authors and if you submit as a medium

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,930
user it gets posted onto the publication

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,850
with your name

00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,560
the author yeah and so it's very clear

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,690
who wrote that content and who says it

00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,400
and whose voice it's coming from and the

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,670
collection is just collect collecting it

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,230
so I really really like the idea of

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,790
putting out a theme because that's

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,130
minimal effort for the you know we can

00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,980
decide those a whole year in advance and

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,020
then you can put out the you can give

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,140
the opportunity to any developer a new

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,300
developer of hey write something about

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,400
this and then you know we'll still have

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,200
that bar technical review which we would

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,660
you know people can help with but we'll

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,370
set it much lower because it's no longer

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,070
saying this is a node.js stamp of

00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:32,350
approval thing but it's saying here's

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,990
people from the huge community we have

00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,670
and here's us signal boosting and using

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,920
their content not using it by giving it

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,910
a bigger platform so then the work that

00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,830
is involved is more aligned with being

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,570
that gatekeeper but setting that bar as

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,910
low as possible with not as low as

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,980
possible but as low as is useful and is

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,890
something we can all stomach while

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,620
saying hey we don't necessarily endorse

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,330
all of this content you know we haven't

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,130
vetted all of it we've technically

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,170
reviewed it and we're it's good enough

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,880
to get up there but you know this is

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,500
someone else's this rep this is not

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,330
coming directly from the mouth of nodejs

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:17,290
you know don't put this into production

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:19,270
and sue us over it or whatever they have

00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,980
it so what you would have to do is start

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:26,650
a new post but that's that's a really

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:28,930
good observation I like having tiers of

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,900
content so right there's content

00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:35,050
produced by people from the foundation

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,270
there's content produced from events

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,310
related to the foundation there's

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,740
content on these themes and then you can

00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,790
even go one step below that and have

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,310
link roundups

00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:48,910
yeah yep link roundups yeah and then

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,320
that's a nice way to lay okay somebody

00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,820
puts a lot of time and effort into

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,360
something and it's good but it's not

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:57,520
quite at the level you can say hey if it

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,400
were shorter or if it had more examples

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,040
or you know if it were written against

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,620
no.12 instead no ten we would have

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,600
accepted it but we'll put it in the late

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,980
and I've just looked at the collection

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,230
and I saw a lot of stuff posted by

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,470
rising stack and it looks like we have a

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,090
huge content it looking I didn't look

00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,230
directly at their content too much but

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,480
it looks like they're doing linked

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,340
roundups already so that's one thing

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,500
potentially taking care of - I'm

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,909
basically you know I I want to volunteer

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,580
my time to help you guys in the way that

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:30,970
I can to do something like this because

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,559
it's it's it's within the my organ is it

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,870
Mike the company I work for we have some

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,630
experience doing this stuff but also I'm

00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:40,510
looking at it in terms of how can we mow

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,730
how can we best leverage the community

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,890
around nodejs to do as little work as

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,440
possible but still give the most value

00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,690
to people out there and also like it's

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,360
thrilling for a new developer to get

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,850
their content posted on you know the

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,740
node.js collection and so we can even

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,779
honing in on that specifically for now

00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,090
or you know and this is just my opinion

00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:03,490
obviously but I feel like that would be

00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,429
the lowest effort quickest way to value

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,529
for both the foundation or for nodejs

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:10,179
and also for the users because if you

00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,700
just get that one person to do the

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:15,610
technical review and say that none of

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,770
this is objectively gaming our system or

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,090
whatever so here we go you know if you

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,250
can get people to submit it through

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,140
medium yes they would have to create

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,610
their another pump another post but

00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,919
that's the way it works with every

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,659
collection on medium and it kind of

00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:29,710
helps streamline that process in my mind

00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:32,260
so I feel like that would be something

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,409
that one or two people could own pretty

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,669
well and then you know as long as one of

00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:38,500
those people being maybe a technical

00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:41,890
reviewer or at least getting some people

00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,840
to cycle in through that role etc may I

00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,390
do that that sounds better to me

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,539
specifically then trying to set that bar

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:53,529
too high or if the thing about the

00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:55,539
conference speakers I don't think that a

00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:58,299
lot of the conferences are affiliated

00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:00,940
with no js' in any way I'm not actually

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,559
sure how many are so it would be kind of

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,779
difficult to even use that as a bar of

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,520
quality specifically because how do at

00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:07,750
what point do you draw a line yeah

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,020
what's you know who's a good speaker

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,020
who's not

00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:26,679
if this is going to be pursued because

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,659
like themed editions would be great but

00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:32,379
it needs a fair amount of lead time

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:34,479
because making sure you get enough stuff

00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:36,429
to fill an Edition that is deemed mean

00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:40,749
that you're only able to accept for each

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:42,849
additional Tara league observation so

00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:45,190
you'll need to make an editorial

00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,830
calendar for say a year in advance but

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,809
haven't start say a couple of months in

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,450
the future to have enough time to

00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,979
accumulate but but it's a great idea and

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,049
it really should be done and I serve

00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:59,190
just one particular publication as a

00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:01,779
great example of how even editions

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:05,200
stripe is a publication called

00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:16,839
increments it's beautiful like when it

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:22,089
comes into my email it's also yeah so

00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:25,629
I'll just go through the topics we have

00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:29,230
to cover if one of the point is to how

00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:32,710
to get writers to review in return or

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,929
maybe how to incentivize them for that

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,569
in the review process because if there

00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:40,169
is some incentive kind of then you get

00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:44,230
you can get easily more more reviewers

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:57,579
oh yeah so any thoughts and even have

00:34:44,230 --> 00:35:00,250
about yeah yeah and also maybe reaching

00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:05,010
out to technical writing communities

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:08,650
like write the docs because they may not

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,329
they may not be daily node developers or

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,270
JavaScript developers but they have

00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:14,920
experience reviewing technical content

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,750
yeah and if there's a big theme the

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,369
genre that Reza talks to that he can

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,470
Portland there's a big theme about how

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,140
to become more involved week when you

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,799
say the conference is called right the

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,799
dock right

00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:46,730
this one is the very and there's also

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:48,260
API the docks in Australia and so one

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,560
thing that makes technical reviewers

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,800
jobs here is having a style sheet and a

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,810
style guide because one of the things

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,930
that the pain about reviewing technical

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,150
content is like Google style guide is

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,910
that open source is always two words and

00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,520
it never has a - yeah and if you've

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,290
learned some other style than you you're

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,630
always trying to check it in your mind

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,880
so every time that something is reviewed

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,380
you want someone in Centrify for you

00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,990
were to add something to the style guide

00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,990
like I've decided that when we talked

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,960
about this it's capitalized this way

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:41,180
yeah well we linked to this source will

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:44,860
be talked about can you hear me oh I can

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:55,100
yes no no I can I can hear you um yeah

00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:58,190
okay no no just thank you for which this

00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,740
would be a great candidate to actually

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,440
have spied for so for context that issue

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:07,850
has opened a little while ago to help

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,800
then contributors for me yes and Rach

00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,330
already does something to thank

00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,190
contributors I'm really happy for what

00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,290
but I know you know something because

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:19,580
people have said that on the issue but

00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:24,470
we were thinking about giving people

00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:29,000
swag that their contributions will

00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:31,730
entitle them reward them with so we have

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,650
a store right now that is the node.js

00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,140
store the thing is right now there's

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,210
some there's some like shipping is a

00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,630
little expensive and I don't a lot of

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,630
people necessarily

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,900
but I've been talking relates it's that

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,599
thank you program I've been talking with

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,750
a couple of the books that Gatsby yes

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,890
you have a great thank you program and

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:58,309
they have said that they're willing to

00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:01,490
share I help us implement their hope is

00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:04,790
first code base for their shop so their

00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:07,309
shop uses the top of the buy SDK in

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:10,730
JavaScript and it also they have their

00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:13,250
own system for using generating coupon

00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,920
codes that are usable in the shop mm-hmm

00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:20,000
based on people logging in with their

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,470
handle like their contributions so

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,270
they're willing to help implemented

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,740
which saves us a bunch of time not to

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,930
mention we don't have to implement any

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,700
of the stuff that they spent like three

00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,510
four weeks flowtown we're going on yeah

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:37,760
and they're very keen to like actually

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:39,049
like share it and they said like we had

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,030
discussion but I don't have hard numbers

00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:44,000
but their contributions have gone up and

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:47,510
people actually do use it and it's their

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,339
way I'm just saying thank you shirt or

00:38:47,510 --> 00:39:17,030
something and shipping closer to lower

00:38:49,339 --> 00:39:19,130
them then yeah I just want to real quick

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,690
on on how to incentivize and how to get

00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:24,589
more technical reviewers I think it's

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:28,190
very tightly related to how to get more

00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:30,859
contributors in general in that like low

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,319
barrier to entry I guess like low

00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:35,420
friction but in that way little friction

00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,299
meaning I want to put a differentiation

00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,790
between technical review and editing

00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,619
because I published on other collections

00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:44,540
before and they didn't edit any of my

00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,619
stuff they're high volume collections

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,270
that are just churning churning and

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,980
churning stuff out you know as a result

00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:50,900
they get a lot of followers and they're

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,920
more attractive to you know I'm not

00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:56,790
saying that y'all should be a high

00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,470
thing but when I say technical review I

00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,380
mean just specifically in terms of like

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:04,080
is this a spam malware like filled

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,590
article that's garbage or is it you know

00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,530
it doesn't meet the bar of mystech maybe

00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:12,540
this person tried their best and if I

00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,780
think that if we frame or if it was

00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,430
framed around hey like MVP version like

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,200
I said I'm lazy I'm imagining how can

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,300
the fewest number people make this whole

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,460
thing work with the largest impact and I

00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,290
think that specifically having one

00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,850
person do a technical review which is

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,890
mostly just read through it in this you

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,600
know is it garbage or not or is it did

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,330
they do it did they do try their best or

00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,160
not and frame it around this part of the

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,100
bulk of the collection is a signal boost

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,780
to other people you know that's what

00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,190
comments are for if it's garbage people

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,410
are gonna tell them or they're gonna try

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,120
to correct them or do whatever obviously

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,410
we don't want flame wars but that's what

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,030
the review is we don't want something to

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,850
get through which is gonna damage that

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,010
person themselves and I think that so

00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,740
putting a differentiation between

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:58,350
editing and reviewing it because editing

00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,850
will increase the the style guide is you

00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,560
know that's how my company works that's

00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,350
how every publishing company works

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,180
that's how you should do it but I don't

00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,220
think that we really have the resources

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,810
right now he's not from my perspective

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,900
on this to be able to really edit

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:14,940
people's stuff and that increases the

00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,100
lead time it increases the cycles of

00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,400
everything so I think that if people can

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,080
submit one person could sit down every

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,330
week or every two weeks or every month

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,400
or whatever you know every week maybe

00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:28,170
two whatever how many days and just boom

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,460
boom boom boom check and decide and then

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,170
they just move things through the

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,760
pipeline and then maybe somebody else

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:36,180
can decide what actually gets published

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,310
win or whatever and maybe the may be the

00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,590
MVP version of it is just trying to work

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,330
out that process to be as smooth and low

00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,690
friction as possible and then we can

00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,430
figure you and a following then we could

00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,500
figure out how to do the theme stuff

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,330
more specifically because like like

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,980
Mineo make brings up a good point you're

00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,480
with themes you know you're just

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,700
selecting a subset of what is being

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,420
published and it's not that and it's not

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,940
that incentivizing for people if oh wow

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,530
I submitted that article four months ago

00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,720
and now it finally is getting published

00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:08,520
because my theme finally came

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,950
so I think that once there is the volume

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,290
of people submitting and accept happy

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:16,349
feedbacks like happening then we could

00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:17,880
probably y'all could do the themes or

00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,990
whatever more effectively I think it's a

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,900
great idea and I would love to do that

00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:24,270
but I think in the meantime it's a it's

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,520
a big process challenge currently and if

00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,770
one person can really be the reviewer

00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,640
the gatekeeper who is you know they

00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,710
would have to have some kind of

00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,690
technical expertise at node and want to

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,160
do this hopefully there'll be ten people

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,049
doing it but you know you can only

00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,000
really count on there being one person

00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:40,950
and if that person and then assume that

00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,780
person is overwhelmed you know that's

00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,130
the way I look at it but that's how I

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,470
think to get more technical reviewers

00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,000
and that's how I think of it incentivize

00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,859
the reviewers themselves is make the

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,349
process as painless as possible because

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:54,059
if you have 18 different reviewers well

00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:56,520
are you really controlling the quality

00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,589
of that well or is that person favoring

00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,930
other people etcetera so fewer reviewers

00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:02,730
that are closer to the team or closer to

00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:10,040
all of this I think is best in my

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,040
opinion yeah something like that

00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,849
[Music]

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:41,040
hey write about how to upgrade and on

00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,930
not so hard and hack tober specifically

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,420
for anybody not familiar is you know a

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,250
big event that happens where people try

00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,869
to you know like come together and hey

00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,190
during this month do an open source

00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,319
commit or something I think that's the

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,299
way it works yeah but also there's huge

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,609
communities that are even bigger than

00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,859
nodejs that we could tap into like 100

00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:02,160
days of code if you could offer like hey

00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:03,359
this is our MVP version is or part of it

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,920
would be like hey if you're doing a

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,500
hundred days of code this is our hundred

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,180
days of code you know track or whatever

00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,650
that were you know like if you're doing

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,119
a hundred days of code and you're

00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,319
blogging about it anyways which you are

00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,569
if you're going on your days of code and

00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,730
you're doing ojs submit it to us and

00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:19,550
we'll signal boost you and look at you

00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:21,860
you know all this stuff so I

00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,090
you know tapping into where that content

00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,830
is already being created

00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,690
having the processes in place to be able

00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:28,100
to review it etc and then at that point

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,440
it's hundred days of code they're

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,960
newbies they're learning and so the bar

00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,240
is a little lower and then that I think

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,170
you can work out your process and get

00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,090
you know and then those people are going

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:54,770
to share the heck out of it because you

00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:56,390
know so whatever I want to people would

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,260
submit those or we collect them but yeah

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,590
but that's a cool idea

00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,990
so no no problem

00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:07,310
so the next thing yeah we got enough

00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:12,050
 not enough but some the next

00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:14,510
point could be like which kind of

00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,400
service do we should we do for our blog

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,830
post for the content which we want to

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,470
dry for like this should be a road map

00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,960
similar to like I have a specialty for

00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:28,280
each month they could be a road map or

00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:31,400
or for the whole nodejs ecosystem that

00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,550
we want to dry like data coming in and

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,750
we want people to adopt it the new

00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,850
features and new functionality which are

00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,730
we going to provide in our in a year or

00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:43,490
in few months in the next quarter we can

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,950
enjoy holy community true through the

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:54,710
publication then what we put on the

00:45:45,950 --> 00:46:00,350
social media topic but I would be super

00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:09,890
lazy and just go after Cooper topics are

00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:12,500
the most yeah okay and also in the

00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,150
beginning if you have a high high ishbal

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,010
you map up locate of a things being

00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,480
published you can you know let it go for

00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,920
a couple of months or something and take

00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,240
a look at you know what's driving the

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,940
most engagement it's not that perfect

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,280
heuristic by any means and also there's

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,869
a good argument to have you know what

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,730
you asked a very good question which was

00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:30,470
Aaron which was what's the goal why why

00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,859
are you all doing this part of it is to

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,809
one put better content out there

00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,950
but to to also be able to drive eyeballs

00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,489
to important things in the node

00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:41,529
ecosystem so I you know having that

00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:43,390
direction of like you know we want to be

00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:45,430
able to highlight specific things which

00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,259
are important but also in order to even

00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:49,299
get that audience you need to have a

00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:50,589
volume of you know you need to have a

00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:54,309
reason for people to follow the

00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:57,160
publication to begin with so okay so

00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:59,049
yeah we can we can now jump on to like

00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:03,579
specifically a social media like

00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:11,289
Facebook Twitter maybe LinkedIn what we

00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:15,160
pause there so this yes we can go on

00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:17,619
yeah okay yeah so I'm just a little bit

00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,869
of background here another thing that we

00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:23,700
are trying to do is just create more

00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:26,440
collaboration between you know the

00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:30,460
foundation and the project in the

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,619
community with social media one of the

00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:36,690
things that was proposed at a calm calm

00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:40,660
meeting several months ago was to have a

00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,940
to sort of have social media chairs so

00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:46,809
people from the community that have

00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:50,079
access to our publishing platform which

00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:55,150
is sprout social to help you know you

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,999
know identify tweet edit tweet curate

00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,609
tweets all of those things and just just

00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:04,779
you know work with engagement it just

00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:06,819
kind of be a counterpart you know to me

00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:08,499
on the foundation side and you know just

00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:11,200
to kind of again improve content improve

00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:15,249
engagement from a social media

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,890
standpoint the second bullet here is

00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:20,049
talks about the social media chair

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,619
initiative but I know that a hot topic

00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:26,470
is also just you know safeguards in

00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:28,749
place around you know code of conduct

00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,789
and things like that so again this is

00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:33,329
just another initiative that were you

00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:36,369
know trying to put some thoughts around

00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:39,789
and put a plan around and to start you

00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:43,779
know executing on you know just so that

00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:46,000
you know folks have other ways to

00:48:43,779 --> 00:48:52,990
participate in this community

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:56,859
that's not just code related yeah so

00:48:52,990 --> 00:49:00,280
yeah social media it's I think in at the

00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:02,440
end it's kind of a reviewer or what

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,690
writer does for a blog post it would be

00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,430
the same person doing this same kind of

00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,250
stuff but for the social media not for a

00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,930
blog post they can they can review they

00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,880
can filter out they can point out but

00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:19,260
what should be highlighted what should

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:22,390
be posted a tweeted or light but yahooey

00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:28,260
any thoughts or any ideas if anyone have

00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:28,260
about such initiative or any feedback

00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:34,000
one I see I think a the simplest

00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,240
question to answer because there's a lot

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,750
of hard questions in there I think would

00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,700
be what platforms would would be best to

00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,740
focus on and part of that goes to the

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,710
why of you know why why are we on those

00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,500
platforms why why is why would why would

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:54,339
things be posted on those platforms etc

00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:55,630
and you made the point I mean Rachel you

00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:58,810
made the point Rachel that the goal is

00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:02,890
to create a collaboration between the no

00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:05,260
js' org and the foundation so I you know

00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:06,460
I could see like a coordinating posts

00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,619
like oh hey this is a big announcement

00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,830
with nodejs and the foundation could

00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:14,440
post that note could post that or things

00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,570
going on with the open Jas foundation it

00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,250
was like he kind of passed down from you

00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,230
know from the or from open Jas to

00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,230
whoever that social media chair might be

00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:25,869
but I I also feel that initially you

00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,490
know limiting it to as few like I'm

00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:30,880
personally this is just my opinion

00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,990
literally I don't know if Facebook is

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,000
the right place for that

00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,430
or if engagement is specifically the

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,420
goal then it would be you know we're

00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,359
we're can you all get the most

00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,400
engagement etc and maybe Twitter is that

00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:44,800
place I don't know but I think limiting

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,510
that scope to like what what platform

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,730
would you guys want to focus on first

00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,680
otherwise it could just be here's the

00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,420
messages we want to put out and then you

00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,030
just schedule them with you know sprout

00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,349
social or whatever to get blasted to you

00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,089
know the Instagram Twitter or Facebook

00:50:56,349 --> 00:50:59,320
like all of your have the same message

00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:01,360
to go out across all

00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,980
channels which is the the least

00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,020
customized approach but definitely the

00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,960
most hands-off like autopilot kind of

00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:11,500
thing mm-hmm I don't have any answers to

00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,090
that specifically I would love the video

00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,730
stuff would be exciting but also that's

00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:19,840
like a lot of production and a lot of

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:22,030
work or whatever so so I know I'm I'm

00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,470
not I'm not so sure what or how it

00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:26,080
should be done but I think answering the

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:28,480
question first of what platforms are the

00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,340
most important and what specifically is

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,710
the goal that you're trying to achieve

00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,710
there is an engagement is it just a

00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,500
present is it like I see further down on

00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:39,970
the on the on the section to highlight

00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,130
things in the community which gets

00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:44,260
difficult because then it's speaking

00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,480
from the mouth of the nodejs which is

00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,160
unless the whole organization can agree

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,440
on what things it wants to highlight

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,560
maybe it could it gets dicey there you

00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,550
know that one social media chair would

00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,200
know somebody would always be upset

00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,280
about something basically but there

00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,860
could be things that could be

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,110
agreed-upon foundation wide that could

00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,850
then be you know promoted or whatever

00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:12,460
maybe come from the foundation that are

00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:14,590
approved or whatever may be a very

00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,330
simple place to start is to just have

00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,720
one twitter account that's the official

00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:21,040
foundation account and it tweets

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:28,170
incredibly boring but authoritative

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:30,400
things that are like how you contact the

00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,810
various people and it's just on the

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,490
schedule it's weeding once or twice a

00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:52,390
day and then you fill up a queue with

00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:55,000
fairly safe things and then LinkedIn I

00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:59,080
think like it also has the same problem

00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,380
that it's very very easy for them so my

00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,630
my gut would they start with a boring

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:08,710
administrator Twitter account yeah or

00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:10,870
like signal boosting the more official

00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,090
things published on the collection you

00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:16,690
know you can set up to

00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:18,400
host to LinkedIn to post to Twitter or

00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,980
whatever the simplest kind of those can

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,960
be automated even as my point but the

00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,210
safer stuff or it could just say hey we

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,880
posted a thing but I think smaller

00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:30,520
volume more focused would be the most

00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:42,520
eligible right now and also would upset

00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:44,980
the fewest amount of people probably one

00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,230
of the things that I find that our that

00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,100
the community really likes like

00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:53,080
open-ended questions I find that those

00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,230
are the ones that we just get so much

00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,390
engagement for a lot of retweets and so

00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:01,120
what would be how I know like what would

00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:04,630
be helpful for my perspective is to kind

00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,460
of like understand what people want to

00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:09,340
know about and and what what some of

00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,390
those questions could be you know and

00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,150
that kind of goes back to the

00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:15,250
potentially the reader survey that I was

00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:17,400
kind of that we kind of outlined I mean

00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:24,790
it's also interconnected right I mean it

00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:26,140
just got just how it works and even even

00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:28,300
better than that sorry to cut you all

00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,130
off keep if we're talking about Twitter

00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,050
cuz that's a super you know for this

00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:35,320
community it's a super popular platform

00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:37,600
that would be ya know what or votes

00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,360
could be but even forget even back just

00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,310
a hashtag just a hashtag and then see

00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,440
what gets the most likes you know and

00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,360
then coal from that basically and say

00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,790
okay and you know you could either

00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,380
retweet other people's questions which

00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,870
would be super easy you could just get

00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:55,000
one person logged in you know even still

00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,220
then it's kind of difficult to you know

00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,980
somebody has to make that decision but

00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,690
if you go by like here's the hashtag ask

00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,940
questions and then the nodejs account

00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:05,380
will either phrase them in its own voice

00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:07,300
because it could look at the aggregate

00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,700
and kind of distill it or it could be as

00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,830
simple as just a human retweeting ones

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,510
that are good but even that actually

00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:15,310
let's not do that because you don't know

00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,050
who you're retweeting that could get

00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,400
messy

00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,140
but if you just have a hashtag where

00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,580
people could ask the questions and it's

00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,100
already on the platform it's already

00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,000
people that are gonna see and be engaged

00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,620
and you know you could take the

00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,830
aggregate and take the individual out of

00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,500
it

00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,880
but just see what the themes are or if

00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,950
it's a really specific question and

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,540
they're a known community member then it

00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,480
would probably be safer to credit them

00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,260
but retweeting is often seen as

00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,620
endorsement

00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:44,020
so it's you know yeah yeah we would do

00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,990
like am a node yeah I'm a no no be cool

00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,790
yeah yeah I mean it could even you could

00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:50,590
even and then the node account could

00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,930
jump into a hundred days of code or

00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:56,380
girls code or like a bunch of the really

00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:59,020
cool community hashtags and just go you

00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,150
know hey we're doing AMA blah blah like

00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:04,240
ask us questions and you know just

00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:06,570
signal booster jump into that stream of

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:13,200
crazy content that's always happening so

00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:16,270
I'm lazy like I said very this is to

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,520
rock what's going on in the community on

00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:20,710
in that current day like if it's what's

00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,690
the new conference going on what's the

00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,360
new event is going on what's happening

00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:28,090
within this this week or this month and

00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,100
we can boost the content and the quality

00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:33,040
of social media goes through that like a

00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:38,290
respectable fresh do going on its today

00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:40,210
the core or similar topic oh yeah and

00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,100
also we talked a bit about incentive and

00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,770
there's so much power behind the node.js

00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,170
brand there's so much reach so much and

00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:49,210
so there's questions that I would love

00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,730
to pitch with a node.js community's

00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,590
brain about and so that's why I would

00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:55,240
tweet a thing which would be like how

00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,640
are you guys using streams doing it does

00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,530
anyone understand streams you know like

00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,110
that's a question I would love to see

00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:03,430
the community at large go you know

00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:05,290
decide whatever they're gonna say about

00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,040
it I follow that thread so that's

00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:13,210
exciting to me just as a consumer base

00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:15,460
what would go wrong about about being

00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,170
specific about some technical detail is

00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,510
the same there would be some folks who

00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:23,140
don't who do get messy and we already

00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:25,330
see about some specific point yeah what

00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:28,020
you guys look like I'm not going to pick

00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:30,910
the issue in the streams and like yeah

00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,860
so that that comes out that comes down

00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,930
the voice in my opinion and with the

00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,730
voice and character that we tweet those

00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:39,790
things from it would be uplifting

00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,300
positive and inspirational that would

00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,920
you know

00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,350
it's words you can throw on a you know

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,720
word cloud or whatever but there is like

00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:48,730
code newbies is a big community they do

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,780
a lot of stuff where it's just like what

00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:54,730
are you working on you know or yeah or

00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,560
what was the last time you fail or you

00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,330
know like tell me a story about you

00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:04,150
failing or you know something that at

00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:05,670
least has a whiff of uplifting this oh I

00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:10,000
haven't heard of that hilarious

00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:11,470
yeah and that I feel like that builds

00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,210
community because you get to discover

00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:17,190
other people in that thread and it's

00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,190
around a shared interest and experience

00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,859
[Music]

00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:32,710
yeah you'll ask him your last commit

00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:36,010
message isn't good one too but okay yeah

00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:38,080
that thing or maybe I'll offer all doing

00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,450
all these things Rachel I don't know

00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:44,620
maybe you at this point maybe we don't

00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:48,400
need a social media chairperson me I

00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:51,940
don't know maybe you can handle maybe we

00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,250
can focus more about quality and type of

00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:59,260
the content then just just throwing

00:58:54,250 --> 00:59:00,610
stuff can you direct yeah but yeah I

00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:05,140
don't know just the same thing just

00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:06,970
stare into mind that maybe you're maybe

00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:09,820
we don't need more content we need more

00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:12,550
quality and more specific and some team

00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:15,250
content kind of thing more generation

00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,990
yeah motivation yeah yeah no I I

00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,470
definitely I definitely heard that I

00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:23,740
think the idea of of bringing in a

00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:25,390
social chair was to kind of help guide

00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:28,570
some of that as well someone who's more

00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:33,700
in bed with the community but I know you

00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:35,470
know but I do see I do see I broke down

00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,700
all those questions they're really super

00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:40,900
funny and I do see an opportunity to

00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,360
just do some different things so this

00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:48,640
has just been eye-opening for me so I do

00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:50,890
appreciate that yeah yeah yep that's I

00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,510
agree with your point yeah everyone here

00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:55,490
is super happy so yes

00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,460
Vidia chair could it's not just what we

00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:01,220
are getting the content a specific

00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:04,849
person from node community can also help

01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:08,150
you guys like the one managing the

01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:10,460
social community channels - like what

01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:13,130
kind of questions would be good what's

01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:15,109
within the community like yeah yeah I

01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:18,589
think it would be good if that person is

01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:22,130
that person who you know speak about the

01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:24,020
things we have it sounds like it I'm

01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:26,480
assuming but what might be an ideal

01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,640
workflow for y'all is like a spreadsheet

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,650
with a whole bunch of topics that

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,500
somebody or the community has already

01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:35,089
vetted or you know whatever it's like

01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,440
that way you can you can worry about

01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,960
just scheduling and getting them out

01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,880
there yeah and you know like you can

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,109
asynchronously do the work or someone

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,210
else can asynchronously do the work

01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:46,430
where they're like here's three years a

01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:48,380
month's worth of this or three months

01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,680
worth of these questions like one or two

01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:54,470
tweets a day or something like that then

01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,820
obviously somebody will somebody who

01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:58,369
knows the community would need to really

01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,839
select that stuff but then yeah

01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:01,339
definitely you know maybe that would be

01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,310
the social media chair perhaps I know

01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:06,109
yeah because one of the things one of

01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,690
those things to your point one thing

01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:10,940
that I find helpful is you know

01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:13,130
obviously I've got I've got Twitter on

01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,780
my phone and I'll get a direct message

01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,609
saying this is a really interesting

01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,710
tweet or the thing they're really cool

01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:20,480
kudos or whatever so that's something

01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:24,530
that like okay I'm going to retweet this

01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:27,140
or like this or or something and and

01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:30,650
it's 10 out of 10 times they're always

01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:33,650
great recommendation and so just things

01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:37,520
like that that kind of help you know

01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:39,170
people who are sort of in it a little

01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,950
bit you know not say that I'm not but

01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,359
they're you know they're people who

01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,510
aren't coming all day and they're you

01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,490
know they're just you're up to summit

01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:48,380
things like that or just helpful just

01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:50,510
kind of and it it kind of helps guide

01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,310
other things that I'm looking for that

01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:54,349
the community will find helpful

01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:58,420
so some I'm sorry could I interrupted

01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:58,420
you interrupt someone I'm sorry

01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:04,770
that is that it's often good to have

01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:07,020
somebody's on call just because you know

01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:09,420
let's say heaven forbid the Queen passes

01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:13,140
away we don't want like your tweet to me

01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,790
in the stream right like with with big

01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,410
terrible things happen

01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:20,790
I feel like brands need to turn off

01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:27,900
their Twitter feeds for a while yeah you

01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:29,609
don't want to make an ill-timed joke if

01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,800
there's a terror if there's a terrorist

01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:32,940
attack in a city where conference is

01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,900
happening you're like y'all having a

01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:40,140
good time and yeah that's that sounds

01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,849
like a compelling reason to have some

01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:43,590
kind of social media chair who just has

01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:47,460
their thumb on the pulse

01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:49,530
ie tyranny is probably too busy but like

01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:51,140
that's the PERT that's the spirit of

01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:54,090
somebody who is in the community

01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:57,180
connected knows how Twitter works good

01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:59,040
you know and is like able to they're in

01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,390
the middle of those things where they

01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,099
could curate it and even if it just

01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:08,400
means filling up your inbox and that's

01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:11,609
just me being lazy again so that's a

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,010
really yeah or maybe those are the

01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:16,020
people who but I have a thing Google

01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:24,060
affected by the by the thing actually

01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:34,260
and they yeah yeah what were you trying

01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:37,260
to say Mignot we're having you know

01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,760
having several some methods some

01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,440
somewhere out there where there's a

01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:48,089
couple of trusted people who have the

01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:50,430
login or something yeah yeah the bus

01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:56,790
factor I like that somebody gets hit by

01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:59,339
a bus right so yeah one last point one

01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:02,730
idea was to manage the tutor or account

01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:06,900
through the github so that once you can

01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:09,750
log in I think into Twitter through

01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:13,340
github profile and you get the XS but

01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:17,010
then you know what the person who is

01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:21,390
with some submitting some post who is

01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:25,410
the person behind but yeah I'm seeing

01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:59,370
this but this idea was in an in

01:04:25,410 --> 01:05:05,480
another talk see I think I think we're

01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:08,340
good for now okay because you're yeah

01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:14,970
good conversation yeah it was really

01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:17,730
good and so no we can talk we can set up

01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:20,490
a one-on-one meeting litters yes that

01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:23,160
sounds good I think I think what also

01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:25,080
what I'll do is take these notes and

01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,180
maybe synthesize them into just like a

01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:29,550
recap of what you know what we discussed

01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,890
and so maybe put together some initial

01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:34,650
recommendations based on this yeah but

01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:36,810
it was super awesome I really appreciate

01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:39,420
you know you getting this together

01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:41,790
and I you know I think we'll get really

01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:44,700
I think I think the next steps will be

01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:49,550
really really positive for us yeah okay

01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:49,550
