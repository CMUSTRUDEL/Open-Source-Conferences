within the open Jazz foundation impact

00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:13,000
probe at large and emeritus projects if

00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:16,240
you are a member of a project within

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,520
that category and you want to come and

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,090
introduce the the project that I'd ask

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,350
you to come up and like queue and then

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,119
once it's your turn we can just give you

00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,539
the microphone and do like quick three

00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,860
minute or so intro to the project who's

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,410
involved with the project what some of

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,879
the goals of the project are if there's

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,770
any specific requests or calls for

00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,629
participation or leads or whatever that

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,989
the project has then we'll give you a

00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:52,270
moment to and to make our custard learn

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:52,840
some visible nixon's for me Thank You

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,079
Christian

00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:03,690
very enthusiastic 9 so we have five

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:08,619
impact projects node of IBM jQuery dojo

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:12,060
so if you are here on behalf of any of

00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:14,290
those projects or when I make any

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,619
announcements on any of those projects

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:22,390
let me ask you to come forward Christian

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,900
can you come talk to about apathy for a

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:36,909
second okay since y axis it since Jonah

00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:39,369
and Dan are here I mean talk about yeah

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,619
we started appium a while ago to support

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,990
testing on mobile because it's really

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,909
different every to anyone is different

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,649
have native automation strategies and

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,030
you can use them but if you wanted why

00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,750
the tester works will go up at the same

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,140
time it's going to automatic and a human

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,640
tries to overcome this problem by

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,719
providing and testing the face based on

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,240
the work which is a recipe I kinda can't

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,159
send a cheapy request that we can do it

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,650
with any language and it allows you

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:14,930
choose from mobile test on time and

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,230
scaling up and as you wish

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,269
and gathered SP the system is pretty

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,120
large because there may be some modules

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:28,269
that try to support different native

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,670
automation strategies and I think early

00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:35,239
shonandgraham they're on top of their

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:42,709
strained project chorus and yet if you

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:52,669
forget about them you know here on

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:55,030
behalf of okay I'll just quickly I don't

00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:59,599
think I need to introduce what jquery's

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:02,269
know but if you want to reach out to

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,799
that project the representatives are

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,150
dating have been and to me will I think

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,849
largely they're working on

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,969
infrastructure and they just basic kind

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,549
of routine release management nothing

00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:20,989
stuff like those guys are the reps for

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:22,760
jQuery on the dojo side dojo is another

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,629
modern web framework which is very

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,069
popular within enterprises the wonderful

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:33,620
Dylan Shimon and also that gap are

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,930
representatives from that project to the

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,379
open jazz foundation they didn't send

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,669
their regrets but awesome team and

00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,389
webpack probably another project did I

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:51,290
know he to introduce Sean Larkin and

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:58,099
even skins burn are the representatives

00:03:51,290 --> 00:04:03,109
to the CBC for what let's see

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:06,739
moving on to our next February we have

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,780
six growth level projects within the

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,849
open Janice Foundation and super quickly

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,229
road projects are projects caps of key

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:18,380
objective that they're trying to reach

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,989
maybe like for example to grow the

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,789
number of contributors or to increase in

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,800
the heart of like you know a highly

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,400
visible implementations that sort of

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,110
stuff we have stick

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,100
wonderful growth projects architect

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:39,460
intern no red webdriver webkinz and

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,870
Logano here so if you are a 19 or

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,040
contributor to one of those clinics and

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,110
you want to come up and introduce it

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:53,210
please come forward

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:55,310
I know you're here it's only okay so it

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,370
was just a plane it's been a theorem so

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,940
WebDAV I uh is too kind to run tests for

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,640
instance woman mm or to run the browser

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,300
division test and pink available

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,810
selenium but rigorous design framework

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,580
it you know takes care of a lot of tasks

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,590
that you would do normally if you

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,510
usually think things are the nuances a

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:22,580
full forever run tests we purposely yeah

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,190
if you go on together both with the

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,910
project we have one maintain our once

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:33,770
machine could be here so that's exciting

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:50,120
I haven't seen him so far yeah if you

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:52,810
want to get them you know just come to

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,710
the reception and say hello to me or

00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:06,800
send me message all the way is github

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:17,620
whenever you make which is a testing

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:23,480
framework we are I've also learned

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:26,680
technique is here node-red is it's like

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:33,070
a flow based low code programming

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:35,180
platform originally was written to

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,830
essentially work was a lot of my EMT

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,460
devices and it works really well for

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,440
that

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,440
works really well with

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:52,100
in that sort of thing and there's a

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:57,210
ecosystem creating custom integrations

00:06:52,100 --> 00:07:09,180
and set up that tool can be found at no

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:14,100
red dots on it okay so that leaves

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:18,540
architect which is Elmer I ran through

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,090
and the company's company begin also

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,060
Chris Rogers is representing that

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,780
project on the CPC so you can reach out

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:33,630
to either of those persons architect is

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:34,770
a service framework and given if you

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,590
want to get involved with that project

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:43,770
in turn is another project from the dojo

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:45,180
team so again you can reach out to she

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,370
learned a bit more about that but it's a

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:54,690
test stack where javascript jscript

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:56,910
let's see then web hint Anton

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,410
milena I don't think I think she's here

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,310
this weekend is really but I don't think

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,680
he's at this event and he's at Microsoft

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,300
and he he represents that project on

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,020
this you can see and it's very active

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,600
there it's a lynching tool I think these

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,460
are pretty common projects though so

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,550
we'll see y'all probably don't think too

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:23,130
much info about them all right at large

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:28,080
so we have 15 our projects which I don't

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:30,950
like the bell curve I think for our

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,210
projects but out large projects are

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,880
mostly projects that are in maintenance

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,180
mode they're still actively used but

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,919
they don't necessarily have lots of

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,510
resource requirements or the internet

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,070
foundation so they are they're kind of

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,480
trucking along and if they need some

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,640
things you can or if they have an

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,770
objective that they want to get more

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,220
foundational resources to

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:59,190
to reach then they can upgrade to a pro

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,010
status but these projects are kind of

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:06,540
doing their own thing and happy to do it

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:09,480
we have 15 as I said yes lunch Escrima

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,300
Express will give e flow - Marco

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,990
messageformat moment globalised friends

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,260
a hospital run fq unitary script and

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,780
inter ledger if there are folks from any

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:26,760
of those projects would like to come

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:32,660
forward and chat about what you're

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:36,870
working on or the making of meetings hi

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:41,910
Emily maintain a message format which is

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:44,550
a language for localization working with

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,140
plurals and all sorts of interesting

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,810
things that you might want to do with

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,810
the text in whatever you're working with

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,000
Sexton who originally started that

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:11,360
project but I think most of the code is

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,540
more of the code is now mine and his

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,880
yeah I also mess around with all sorts

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,790
of other localization things in

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:30,000
JavaScript because it's only useful to

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:35,070
fund projects that we have a foundation

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,980
to yeah the next reason why I'm here is

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:46,590
because I ended up getting onto the

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:51,030
cross project council projects from any

00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:56,010
out large projects in the interest of

00:10:51,030 --> 00:11:00,630
time I won't describe too many of them

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:03,330
other than to share a couple of kind of

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,630
things with the maintainer x' would

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,630
appreciate

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,459
first time I want to shout out to the

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
moment team and not pin to is frequently

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:19,110
represents the now my guess opened jazz

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,709
foundation at tc39 currently the James

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,329
foundation in tc39 and kind of on that

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:28,649
note like the project is really looking

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:32,360
to get a lot of it where we've kind of

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:34,800
brought into the spec and wrap up

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,500
another project that I think is

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,600
interested in support to kind of

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,420
conclude or move on from its work is

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:47,550
actually hospital run which is a really

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,440
cool application that is it's a offline

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:54,149
person application actually they are

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,510
looking for so if you are interested in

00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:59,550
working on our real world app that a

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,519
project that really helps a lot of

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,620
people definitely talk to me about

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:11,640
hospital room because they would love

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:13,709
your assistance let's see I'm in last

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,620
but not least we have find the Nerdist

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:21,660
projects which are so called because we

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,760
value their contributions to the

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,890
ecosystem but they are functionally

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,430
concluded so we're not really

00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,870
recommending that people go adopt these

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,660
projects or against these projects but

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,209
that being said we feel like the word

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,149
emeritus really does can face respective

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:42,180
appreciation for the time and efforts

00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:45,540
that they wouldn't and so just to quick

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:53,390
shout out and port one out for jQuery UI

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,390
jQuery Mobile requirement he has it so

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:10,560
this was intended to be just so yes I am

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:15,089
missing Jed dollars I just uh judge

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:20,700
should be was degenerate emeritus that's

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:22,340
right yeah see

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:33,060
[Music]

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:35,400
there we go Jen that was an Alex - okay

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,610
so that sort of just kind of recounts

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,590
that chance foundation projects you know

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,800
a little bit later we'll be having a

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,660
session for the CPC itself so if there

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,880
are specific questions from this group

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:52,530
about the cross project council I

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:56,160
definitely attending that session but if

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,620
there are questions or you know ideas

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,640
about any of these projects like I'm in

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:09,020
over the floor we can conclude early we

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,020
have a dance party yeah - are you still

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:24,390
so like Jessa anything so coming from

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,360
the node mothers in their foundation I'm

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,110
curious like you know it's part of the

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:37,890
community

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:43,530
note how I like to do that work and hope

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:46,500
with them it's an interesting topic just

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,970
kind of building relationships so if

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,090
you're interested definitely either

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:56,280
right now or you have to talk to it

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:58,980
simple so I love that you know one of

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,420
the reasons why we did a merger was so

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,450
that our project communities could

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,870
collaborate more closely together and I

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:24,030
think this is a real opportunity to do

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:26,480
that this week so strong was one how do

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,480
you see

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,670
you're sealing there more projects

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,670
onboarding and like how do you encourage

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,750
because well I think from a sort of more

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:50,790
like user perspective like I know sort

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,790
of that the generous combination existed

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:58,230
but wouldn't remember project I think

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:03,090
it's still sort of like boom unclear

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:07,240
getting get into that and conscious of

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:09,070
that's a great question so one of the

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,050
things that we are also hoping to solve

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,980
here is that one where were two

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,780
foundations nodejs Foundation J has no

00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,370
nation it was a bit confusing for people

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,000
who had projects that we're looking for

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:29,200
a third place so to speak which one they

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,260
should go to a lot of people from

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,420
potentially joining either group so

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,890
we're hoping then the merger also makes

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,030
it more clear that there's really want

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:43,840
ecosystem and we care about all of it so

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:46,990
that's one that's another goal through

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,210
this transition process we have sort of

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,430
had to figure out a negotiator at least

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,130
time how the Jazz foundation used to

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,470
view project operating what worked with

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,360
that what didn't work with that it's for

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,900
the node community like how to how we

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,850
sort of kind of combine our process even

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,459
a way that makes sense so the

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,150
conversation around like project poverty

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:14,610
is very much active and alive you go to

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:17,709
our open days foundation bootstrap

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,440
project couple remote you can see a

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,510
couple of different issues in the PRS

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,910
that are like proposals for how we do

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,650
project according moving forward we do

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,780
have a bunch of projects that are

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,000
starting to talk to us now like because

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,910
it makes more sense like oh you go to

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,220
the open air foundation and we're we're

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,740
working with them to figure out like

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,290
what process makes the most sense for

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,920
that community and how to have this

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,940
conversation

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,060
in a open but also respectful way

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,660
consume yeah

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,660
yeah

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,780
hi everyone I'm Manuel from package my

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,290
demands things I'd like to understand

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,930
how you were only today at large project

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:13,000
15 at large project because for example

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:17,070
in our team we have found difficult to

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:31,210
define how to live on which project land

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:34,060
based on issue so on the categories we

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,700
didn't we didn't ask the projects to opt

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:41,110
in to the category that they felt suited

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,330
then we didn't apply any metrics when we

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,710
were combining them that is something

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,510
that I think the CPC will take on and

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:52,060
within the year to sort of figure out

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,790
okay how do we really define what an

00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,660
impact project is what the goals of the

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:01,720
project it looks like that kind of thing

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:05,380
but at large these 15 out large projects

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,330
opted into that stage and he will

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,820
probably reevaluate on in the annual

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,100
basis whether all of the projects that

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,320
are at large should really be there or

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,570
are there some that need to be emeritus

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:25,660
for growth or if they want to do want

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:28,840
you to impaction I don't think some of

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:34,060
them hi everyone my name is Ivana seem

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:39,640
Boston and I'm sorry max is living our

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:40,750
question tree my person collaborators

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:48,700
something I'm here because I have a

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:51,850
problem so my heart question is have you

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,460
guys kind of consolidating these

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,940
different ships of culture right bring

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,520
your pathway no yeah might be like team

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,960
a team B teams even team a team like

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,390
they're all and they

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,490
nobody at the end of the day versus like

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,740
all of these distributed modules that

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,450
are bike tour packages libraries that

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,799
kind of have their own governance and

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,960
their own way of doing things in their

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,850
own I think I'm just curious like how I

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,159
mean just just from a management

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:39,620
perspective it's like having like going

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:44,390
from like 120 so whoa that's hot

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,890
I don't think it's so straight it may

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,590
not be as obvious for people who aren't

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,880
super involved enough but note itself as

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,850
you mentioned has lots of different

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,130
teams but the way in which note works is

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,990
like we have the TSE on the compound

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,700
which are two separate top-level

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,320
committees and then we'll have a

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,230
combination of different teams of

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,279
working groups a subtle difference that

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,080
you don't really know unless you've

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,760
showed up to know that even we get it

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,289
wrong sometimes like let's make a

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,970
working group about that's really not a

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:12,710
team and the biggest difference is like

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,539
a team is a coordinating group of people

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,100
working on a problem whereas it working

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,500
derivative Germany's been chartered

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,419
oversee a particular thing and they own

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,130
it so a good example the difference here

00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,890
would be like release and build our

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:28,159
working groups release owns releasing

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,080
them the TSE cannot go to the release

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,010
team and even question what they're

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,380
doing without me chartering the team

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,600
build owns build the TSE can't show up

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,549
and tell the build team out of the

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,610
resources without me chartering their

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:46,070
team the result of this is that even

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,110
note itself between the compound and the

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,789
TSC and our various charter working

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,100
groups is an election of different

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:55,010
cultures which is maybe not even to

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,600
literally obvious each within that has

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,820
their own governance or the modules game

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,440
for example when i started earlier as

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,940
drafted their own complete governance

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,270
model that's different than any other

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,559
team over here so from a different

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,870
culture perspective and i don't even

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,399
think no recognize that at first we're

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,760
actually already set up to have all

00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:16,860
these kind of like smaller teams i do

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,320
think that thinking about how do we

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,480
support and help lots of different teams

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,100
that have different needs starts

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,360
challenging some of these assumptions we

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,279
have the collaborators and it was a

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,350
really great example that note has a

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,340
travel budget I won't ask people to

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,200
raise their hands because they don't

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,419
want to put you on the spot whether or

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,519
not funding but a non-trivial number of

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,140
people in this room have their trouble

00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,390
travel completely sponsored by the

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,039
foundation it wasn't only of Jas

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,710
well one of the things that we realize

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,600
is perhaps this collaborators them it

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,490
should really just be its own chartered

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,200
working group under the project Council

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,750
that has its own budget it's not

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,309
specific to node so it's not just like

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,529
there's no the specific thing so we do

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,960
definitely have to like question some of

00:22:55,529 --> 00:23:01,049
these things but to me I think that this

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,480
challenge of like scaling all these bits

00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,039
will actually make all the processes and

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,010
things that we have in place are more

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,690
robust and reliable but just a general

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,000
abstraction thing like you saw them from

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,130
one to a many certainly we haven't

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,929
solved for one and now we're like

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,760
immediately moving to solving for many

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,919
but when we figure out how to solve

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,289
these problems from it will be much

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,779
better you know right off the bat one

00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:26,789
thing that I could say is like the TSE

00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,679
though used to like more or less

00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,380
directly report to the Board of

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,659
Directors over the foundation and not

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,059
everyone who's on the TSE who is more

00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:39,419
focused on the technical direction of

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,620
the project cares about all the things

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,149
that have to do with running a

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,830
foundation it's not necessarily why

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,389
they've come there that resulted in a

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,919
splitting our evidence into a technical

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,210
steering committee ater quarter

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,510
tournament committee for a while there's

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,690
so many Africans it's very confusing but

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,519
we never really got the best measure of

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,649
like having a committee that's focused

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,269
on it now with the cross project Council

00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:02,850
we have a community elected governing

00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:04,710
body that hasn't a gathering a governing

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,570
structure or anyone from any project can

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,490
come and participate so it doesn't have

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,950
the same errors that the marriage of

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,539
product governing money has but then

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,169
it's focused on solving these problems

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,340
so the TSC could be far more focused on

00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,500
maintaining notice technical

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,659
infrastructure and when we need money

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,730
for a thing we can just ask the front

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,409
across project council and the few reps

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,010
with no no Parab of that can go to the

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,410
project Council advocate for a very

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,510
practical example to be changes

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,180
or turn our charter used to be chartered

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,470
by the board and any changes audit to

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,940
make to our charter would have to go to

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,500
a coordinating and it's frustrating so

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,910
it mean that like we would need to have

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,820
those changes we would need to have

00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,020
those changes approved as full requests

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,120
that pull request would have to go to

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,970
legal legal and have to review it and

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,940
rubber stamp it all between or beings

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,530
that have applicators now we'll be able

00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,930
to just get charter changes to one of

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,060
our my weekly or weekly council meetings

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,310
and as long as we are making what we

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,790
call substantial changes they can never

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:10,850
even need to go to the board so yes I

00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:12,890
think that like at face value these

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,870
things seem more complicated but this

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,400
extra layer of abstraction that we can

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,040
have because we have more people working

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,670
together is actually going to create an

00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,340
ecosystem in process that's a far more

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:27,920
fine-tuned and far better equipped to

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:32,740
support individual projects than just a

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,740
foundation sorry

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:58,060
I had this moment out in this way like

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:03,070
again I'm becoming a super because now

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:08,000
because because you said working root

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:09,980
means no and like now like doesn't need

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,300
the same thing universally even across

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:18,950
standards bodies working groups world

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:22,460
you know just like you know so it's just

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,460
really funny like so I just as a fresh

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:30,440
perspective I would say that like to the

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:33,920
folks here to kind of question your own

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,080
bias as well as like do some exercises

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,590
that are collaborative and potentially

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,600
painful with all of the new people and

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,910
all the new projects together around

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,830
kind of redefining terms and

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:48,680
or maybe some things right because I

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,720
think that there's a lot of like there's

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,600
conventions and you know things that are

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,950
just to maybe do things that are also

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,750
just kind of transparent and not

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,730
necessarily obvious and that's not

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,410
constructive

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:04,700
I'm wording and welcoming a new member

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:09,650
search committee we've definitely gotten

00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:12,410
some not painful or maybe pretty boxes I

00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:15,620
think one thing to just wrap up so that

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,230
the next session started just you know

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,690
the projects do you get to maintain

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,330
their governance system within the

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:27,200
project so we're not mandating a

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:29,750
specific type of individual project

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,940
governance it's just the the CPC

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,920
operational structure which we hope over

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,600
time will become kind of invisible

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,430
because it will just we'll get these

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,020
Kings four kings worked out and then

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,020
we'll just be focused on providing

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,690
services to the project and it really

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:47,840
like fluid way so anyway thanks everyone

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,300
for your questions and for your time I'm

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,550
going to hand it over to Manila for the

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,550
