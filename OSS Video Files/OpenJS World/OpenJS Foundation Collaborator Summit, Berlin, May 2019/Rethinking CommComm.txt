so this I was not this is intended to be

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,679
like a talker presentation this is more

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,759
meant to be like this elaborate kind of

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:18,140
discussion so how many of you here are

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,640
familiar with the no just me okay so

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,449
kind of there's a few people were kind

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,859
of a few people so the node.js community

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,260
committee is the top-level committee in

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,490
the node project it is one of two

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,660
top-level committee so there's the

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,920
technical steering committee committee

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,590
the community committee is tasked with

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,680
the way I Fraser is outward-facing kind

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,620
of efforts so helping kind of the

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,590
community interface with the project and

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,719
then kind of helping engage with the

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,899
ecosystem at large in certain ways that

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,989
the technical side technically focused

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,570
front parts the private car not or it's

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,309
not like they're still tea there's more

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,079
do that more to it in that we've had

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,300
some scope creep and things uh other

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,409
interesting things that popped up

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,390
and so that's rethinking kind of certain

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,049
elements of that and making sure that

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,090
we're being working most optimally

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:18,979
including working with the technical

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,320
side of the project and basically

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,939
optimizing what we're doing to ensure

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
that we're getting the most out of the

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,310
work that the community committees doing

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,610
these kind of what I wanted especially

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,159
so for a little bit of context I hope I

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,630
was chairperson co-chair and the

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,990
chairperson at the compliment for a year

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,320
I helped a lot with the gong comm I

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,640
spent a lot of time in it and it's

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,000
something I really care about and I want

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,649
to make sure that we're able to kind of

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,119
get a lot of value out of the work

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,490
that's been done and it could be

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,060
continued to be done from the kind of

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,610
same point of view or same same intent

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,189
so I do want to start this off by just

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,290
saying there me how we have a lot of

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,789
really awesome contributors it's really

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,590
been nice to grow there's initiatives at

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,150
this point that have grown beyond the

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,780
community can be scoped so like their

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,610
members

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,530
of those initiatives who do not miss Li

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,420
understand like know the community

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,459
committee and like don't participate in

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,600
at the level and that was Michael for a

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,510
long time is like the community needs to

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,730
be administrative and it administrates

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,060
the kind of efforts that work under it

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,560
as they need it basically and purchase a

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,380
log get on the way and a lot of times

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:44,420
dutiful so um the community committee

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,370
has a few different initiatives well

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,989
kind of a lot of initiatives so these

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,790
are current initiative and current

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,739
initiatives in the nationalisation

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,870
mentorship nodejs collection outreach

00:02:52,739 --> 00:03:00,209
use feedback and website reason so these

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,069
are we have a champion structure where

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,019
someone from the community but he has to

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,019
be a champion of an initiative for it to

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,120
be a current initiative and then from

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,700
there that person can kind of report up

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
to the compound to allow us to kind of

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,340
understand what's happening to those

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,870
initiatives and make sure we have a line

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,070
to them so they're not just kind of

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,370
floating doing their own thing without

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:25,049
help from help and support these are our

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,269
initiatives that we've either marked as

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,459
in need of champion or they are kind of

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,079
stale in some way for example I'll put

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,100
the blame on myself office hours is

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,810
something that was discussed and I just

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,030
hadn't had the time today I really go

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,650
and do it more despite having been the

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,519
champion and having others offer to help

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,299
there's a bunch of other things that

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,269
code and learning is a really

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,070
interesting thing specifically learn

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,230
friendliness to making other repos other

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,549
than owed friendly to code and learn I

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,230
believe this fund is actually referring

00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:01,140
to calm calm calm calm subjects like the

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,730
compound initiatives making done

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,739
friendly Dakota Meyer so they stay a lot

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,820
of kids to come contribute I get a

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,630
commitment in a Depot in note

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,459
additionally you know there's others

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,209
there we've had others proposed those

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,039
haven't always manifested into this list

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,450
and this list and kind of getting the

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,820
point where we have a list and we have

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,510
the structure of champions took us a

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,370
long time we did a lot of work and you

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,669
know we we got a little did a lot of

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,969
work

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,580
get to this point and I'm going to see

00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,749
if we can kind of explore what we can do

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,139
next

00:04:33,749 --> 00:05:09,750
from these initiatives and also other

00:04:37,139 --> 00:05:13,349
things around I mean I think part of

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,689
this so part of this really is like

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,340
backlog and want to have he said in need

00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,409
of a champion and like a project that

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,539
was already like individual memberships

00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,770
shouldn't be on this list that's

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:29,430
something that's already been determined

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:32,189
to be moved up to CPC and some of these

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,990
were like never washed out projects that

00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:36,330
like needs new champions it's like a

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,699
wish list like if you're interested in

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,169
this here's context we probably need to

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,419
restructure this I think it'd be helpful

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:45,210
to like structure this conversation

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,520
around what does it make sense for the

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,800
node like if node as a community

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,990
committee like wants to have things that

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,599
were made like what did the scope of

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,469
these look like versus at the CPC level

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,060
because I'm nuking a lot of these things

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,680
not just initiative for like looking at

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,319
the various repos because we have like

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,210
education we have evangelism

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,289
you have all of these other repos that

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,300
aren't they get started these area yeah

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,879
health these areas that are really

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,430
important I'm in an historical to know

00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,830
that again it makes more sense to

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,279
provide a framework at the CPC level and

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,529
then help empower other person other

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,930
projects to work together on like best

00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:32,360
practices on the things that they want

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:35,610
to have it unique to their present yeah

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,259
but I agree it's just the question I

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,280
guess is like people were contributing

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,090
to the node one

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,610
you want to just stay or they interested

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,720
in doing the bigger picture like here's

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,730
the template instance like right and I

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,340
think part of the structure that Tracy

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,890
just mentioned could be like this group

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,210
that's under the open des Foundation and

00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,350
by the way just cuz I'm standing up

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,120
there I'm not ramela Keita I'm just

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:06,130
trying to I'm gonna yeah so I I think

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,560
the structure the Tracy's machine it's

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,330
like that bringing something like I mean

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,920
outreach is a good example to me

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,120
I don't think that's a note specific

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,550
thing in any way and I think that should

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,100
be a broader thing that our foundation

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,060
does but something like you know office

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:26,770
hours like if we wanted to bring that up

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,780
a level and define a like have some kind

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,630
of structure that projects if they want

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,710
to you can go pull from and use that

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,720
structure to base their own work off of

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,120
that whether they just want to carve and

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,510
copy it and and start kick it off or if

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,980
they want to actually go ahead and base

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,820
it off of that and then kind of deviate

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,820
and then back up of why they EDA did

00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,910
yeah you can just keep working on you

00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,410
just keep working on mobile using rest

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,960
keep working on your project if you

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,610
would like to pull this information I

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,870
would say like if you want to just keep

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,400
working on what you're working on

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:11,620
already like then like maybe the

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,780
opportunity there is for them to teach

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,030
somebody else who is excited to do it at

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,260
the CPC level about with what they have

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,229
been working on and how they approach

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,510
this yeah and what I was getting at

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,830
there is like just just because we moved

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,880
something up doesn't mean we're not

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,919
going to continue doing it or we don't

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,540
we're gonna stop doing it a note like we

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,990
can continue doing a note how we want

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,780
but note has prior art in our context of

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,669
how we can up level that and then help

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,560
help we can continue doing it our way

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:41,789
and also help other build out the

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,789
framework for others to do it as well

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:06,980
yeah grandma's wear what makes sense

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:08,450
that like so there's there's a different

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,930
there's a few different ways that any

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,090
initiative one is is completely absorbed

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,250
by open j/s like individual membership

00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,480
like no it should not be administrating

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,050
anybody to their membership

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,640
yeah any level there's stuff like office

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,750
hours which it would be good to have

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,790
kites from yes spread learning projects

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,530
but on to your concern yourself with a

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,720
bit of help from foundation folks if you

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,570
need it i and there's other stuff that

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,380
is solidly in the realm of note works

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,330
which like website redesign like we get

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,220
to decide what our look and feel it's

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,760
like instructor or documentation maybe

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,960
we use some fun in your hosting if we

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,750
but even not example I was having

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,940
hearing specialist killer for them I

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,490
think it'd be really gave foundation for

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:15,410
a team provided like there's a template

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:17,150
so theoretically open by simply github

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,250
org which your clothes might be writers

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,120
do problem they just know these template

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,950
reposes yeah but there's there's stuff

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:33,560
that I think lends itself more towards

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:44,990
supplying guys occupation sites lends

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:46,490
itself less well so where you say you're

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,220
trying out websites right yeah yeah yeah

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,020
so I know we were talking about

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,500
infrastructure like infrastructure is up

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,300
to open day a straight as much as

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,310
possible unless somebody wants a one-off

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,560
thing that they're asking for me if you

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,580
want something that's special you can do

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,580
that but you have to maintain

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:10,540
yeah I think wherever you place it as a

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,310
share resources argument that there

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,110
exists a spectrum of things that can't

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,740
be shared every initiative will call

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,900
somewhere on it

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,060
and we have to draw line at some point

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:27,810
like this is project manage something

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:27,810
Foundation accommodation barriers forget

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
the strategic business we moved into

00:12:45,670 --> 00:13:03,460
read me

00:12:46,600 --> 00:13:13,780
oh and two initiatives instead of well

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:15,900
the like education and education I don't

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,900
know

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,110
yeah is it completed oh yeah education

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:34,810
officials and community events badges

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:36,430
yeah yeah

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,960
so I guess more of this question would

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,510
be from folks here in the room is like

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:51,010
what what here would only be applicable

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:57,760
to know ya know dysfunction those of the

00:13:51,010 --> 00:14:06,700
idea I think it is but that doesn't mean

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:19,480
it has to be alright that's what I was

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:23,370
yeah yes that's what that's what that is

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,370
like there's a foundation to take over

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,140
or is it something like sure the

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,300
foundation will get together area bunch

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:44,260
of resources that we can copy notes case

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:46,210
like honestly considering like Wendy's

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,810
is what we're talking about is like

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,430
templates for having these programs any

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,800
other projects like if we're talking

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:59,080
about new collection that would be like

00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,630
exfolia to like a marketing like a blog

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,230
you know feature or like story set or

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:08,170
any of the projects that want it but

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,450
like that's not already in place so work

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,370
still has to be done at the foundation

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,380
level to actually it's like some of

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,880
these things it's just like it's it's

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,920
almost copy and paste like individual

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,450
membership it's like already there but

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,220
then these other things like note

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,950
collection which I think would be really

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,260
helpful to the other projects like how

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,380
how would we move forward with that

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,610
would be like make a repo

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,050
open level and like it's not going to be

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,600
you don't want to make it look like it's

00:15:35,050 --> 00:16:16,870
a program that exists because we're

00:15:37,600 --> 00:16:18,910
creating a bunch of work I I do want to

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,450
interject here pause four of us have

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,450
been talking a lot

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,100
anyone else have thoughts or context or

00:16:28,570 --> 00:17:30,150
something baby go feelings aren't the

00:16:30,100 --> 00:17:30,150
stuff that hasn't been talking the work

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,520
little of the work

00:17:44,230 --> 00:19:23,179
like this so my question for you is like

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:25,279
just moderation in this example do you

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:31,610
all have like a system of moderation in

00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:33,919
place pre-project okay what is that

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,049
something that would be a burden if we

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,840
if like if it was decided like we've

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:41,029
already you already have any like a an

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,700
agreed upon conduct across the projects

00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:47,720
but if we were to come like at some

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,220
point CPC says okay well like part of a

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,059
code of conduct is the ability to

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,240
enforce it can you do you feel

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:58,490
comfortable being able to the first

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,320
would you ask for like outside help to

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,270
learn how to do that or would you need

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,000
people from outside of your project to

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:10,909
help you be okay yeah it's like my king

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,370
is from wearing my moderations you had

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,320
we actually think it's really important

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,000
that you have the context and trust in

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,830
your project when you're doing the

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,950
moderation work if people don't know who

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,950
you are

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:40,909
yeah yeah cuz I do wonder if like I

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,190
don't know if I feel comfortable with

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,140
like some date saying something like we

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,870
providing moderation team to the other

00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,460
projects that's a really tough thing to

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,809
do but also otherwise you're potentially

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:55,070
being a gap for their time base I mean

00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,200
this is just like an interesting things

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,700
like impact products versus at their

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,970
local context they kind of become

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:05,809
detached so is it like is a good idea

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,720
what these to be sort of I'm even think

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:13,820
I like next steps with like considering

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,590
how they go to the open like to be also

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,330
it's like a list of these things that

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,820
have happened with our project that we

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,789
recommend being useful or something

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,270
exciting that other projects to do but

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:30,110
then for it to be worked on instead of

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:33,380
creating a giant backlog would you want

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:53,630
to like have people wondering interested

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:58,039
in seeing my proposal this like three

00:21:53,630 --> 00:22:03,850
initiatives and just kind of taking a

00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,850
more y-you know

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,820
well right you would want to sign it so

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,160
it's not only in like a boat as in like

00:22:17,820 --> 00:23:40,290
I like this day popularity contest it's

00:22:20,160 --> 00:23:41,790
who's signing this was actually I think

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,810
it's an open issue for us with

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:48,960
moderation the neutral facilitator like

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,660
someone who can step in especially when

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,160
it's too far to work closely and say

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,700
like I have absolutely no worse than

00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,440
this you know race talk like we've done

00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,820
minute practice so it's like when

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,220
someone is involved that ends up

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:08,480
happening but it's not like a Gotham you

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,480
do there but like rebalancing

00:24:45,680 --> 00:25:17,610
the 1% of the time you can learn to have

00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:20,040
those structures yes I mean I would say

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,810
maybe it used to be once a quarter now

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:37,700
I've got one thing they feel and they

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:43,910
feel which is notorious for Bayon yeah

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:47,010
and I and I don't think we're trying to

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:52,890
thing we're just putting this from the

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:55,740
narcotics things we're trying to discuss

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,600
how we can level things and like provide

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,680
that during work but like not force it

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,710
and I think that's a discussion to be

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,480
having like whether to take a

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,260
requirement or not which I don't think

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,760
is really about part force requirement

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:12,150
having the framework available is nice

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:18,720
to have an object like how about having

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:21,680
that knowledge still in a way the ones I

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,680
guess once again

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:51,670
and it's to sell into projects it's to

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:54,340
not process so yeah there's a good

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,830
examples like the admin work past which

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,470
was where the TSE common have to decide

00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,180
on things together and we found a lot of

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,630
times where like process has been

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,640
written because of past experiences not

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,780
from but we're always very clear like

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,760
you stop passing anything yeah

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,590
and parted I exactly what you're saying

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,860
don't over optimize for the other

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:19,270
projects so we need to go to building

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,950
things out and see because you know I

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,420
think that's a really important second

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,420
dream that a lot of these

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:36,130
sweet blessings way yes yeah I think the

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,640
rare spot there which we had brought up

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,740
with the photocopier itself it's better

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,720
in terms of like safety and environment

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,720
there is a lot of girls around like

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,110
making sure that we're creating you know

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,450
the room to learn because violative

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,700
product does not mean that you're banned

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:59,200
it means you talk to you and hopefully

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,550
earth learning and like improve but then

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,230
we also just have to make sure that

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,230
we're not directing people right

00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:41,410
we just operations far end of the table

00:29:37,210 --> 00:30:22,000
you guys administer its use for feedback

00:29:41,410 --> 00:30:24,040
like okay I'm in you know what pack

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,470
ideas really interesting what's your

00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:36,700
main it here what did you do and how did

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:38,310
you remember to feed back to your nice

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,190
clothes

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:48,400
what do you got them around like

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:52,350
this being a marginal generalists yeah I

00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,350
know yeah yeah yeah you're a layer under

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:59,110
all this any bubble and then across and

00:31:23,280 --> 00:32:22,390
where the hope is to get and being able

00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:39,090
to somebody like we just had our we're

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:39,090
trying to get suggestions the project

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:50,250
actual format because members import

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,250
that

00:33:21,110 --> 00:34:01,890
and the mandate is capture those or get

00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:04,070
some information just getting actual

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:08,310
businesses were multi-million dollar

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:36,020
projects depended on maybe facilitating

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:42,330
that channel and maybe getting and I

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:44,880
very much agree that I think that's just

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,890
like we probably structure covering TSE

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,679
if there is definitely like a line in

00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:52,500
the sand and there's not a lot of cross

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:57,080
communication which is sad to me and

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,080
that's that was my motivations for this

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,940
so I would say with this just in this

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,530
example what would be really cool that I

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,830
would like this to get from the CPC

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:12,360
level is identifying fees like these

00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:14,740
maps these days of being able to

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,390
mobilize and act on the information in

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,500
markets of course that you've done

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,870
awesome words and then you don't want it

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,140
falling on deaf ears I think you're

00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,940
awesome presentation yesterday on note

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:32,260
health and all of the recommendations

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,360
that you have our recommendation was you

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,660
should just buy all these as issues like

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:44,250
it would be really one of the ways is to

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:48,070
like find people who would find and then

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,840
you know it's up to them right or for

00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,200
someone to show up and say oh cool this

00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,990
issue

00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,590
I can totally tackle this issue this is

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:59,020
really important for us or that's good

00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,760
to know but it's deep prioritize for now

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,770
for the other issues that we have repo

00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,500
because the hope is that your work

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,280
doesn't fall on deaf ears but it is also

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,470
who shows up but yeah and I think in

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,060
that circuit into best practices that we

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:18,340
can do with is how to be worth on

00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,420
opening the channels to like corporate

00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,620
members being able to get this

00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,770
information from a newsletter

00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,740
perspective everything interesting I

00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:29,650
think it as well it's like different

00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:37,000
things that are information are sitting

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:39,580
JavaScript stuff out I'm interesting

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,190
when challenged those are the sorts of

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:46,360
things where like strategy subcommittee

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:48,220
know which was bringing together in the

00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,260
same meeting in action we're chopping

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,060
and doing things it was really good

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,370
because somebody there from Google will

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,020
be able to say yeah I've got two

00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,990
colleagues would be very interested it's

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,000
looking to get interaction so we need to

00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,650
keep that stuff off again as well

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,580
because this is exactly a circumstance

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,580
where I was working together

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:28,690
strategy yeah it's not happening it

00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,859
stops with happen so in this

00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,960
circumstance what I would have now two

00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,750
different strategies would be and the

00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,690
entire reason it existed why it's

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:43,390
important it's not the place generally

00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:44,950
wouldn't get done decisions on but that

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,480
doesn't mean that the word members

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,650
aren't interested some of the board

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,690
members are actually interested in

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,420
during the word and helping facilitate

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,270
information before getting back to

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,130
corporate members so what we would do is

00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,339
having subset of them minimum

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,460
requirement three board members that

00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:05,980
were not community board members

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,070
attending the game alongside people from

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:11,109
the project in this case new projects so

00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,240
we maybe want to say for the order of

00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:15,240
what a certain number of projects needs

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,460
to be represented in the meeting or

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,420
decisions you can have discussion but

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,430
you want to make sure you have the

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,460
perspectives in the route the forward

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:26,440
with statements that require all of the

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,589
the wheels to be greased and working

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:35,530
together to make something happen and

00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:39,310
this is the sort of thing where members

00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:42,400
are very interested in they can certain

00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:48,730
games I devised to help but we haven't

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:54,099
yeah we haven't hit kids co-chaired it

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:58,540
was their body we were waiting for CBC

00:38:54,099 --> 00:39:02,160
to be orange so that the CQC can take

00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:04,839
control and figure out what they wanted

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,089
why we recommend I highly recommended

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:20,559
because there's few other opportunities

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:43,160
you get engaged board members or the

00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:46,489
should be a sunset all right we'll say

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,499
it's not broadcast so the circumstance

00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:53,299
there was that wordy numbers could still

00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:56,799
talk it was recommend you know anytime

00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,799
it was something that would be public

00:40:01,569 --> 00:41:17,559
but I think it's just like sort of the

00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:31,509
right

00:41:37,730 --> 00:42:32,270
we should you know most people I was

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:42,060
gonna say you guys figure out things

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:44,730
what should be what responsibilities of

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:47,130
the calm within no js' you put

00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:50,010
yourselves in the shoes open a project

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,570
essentially say with your knowledge what

00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,510
responsibilities of the compound would

00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:56,430
you love to see in a redundant if you

00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:59,100
open JSF foundation is functioning at

00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:02,220
its highest level it's like what things

00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,470
are y'all already doing that could be

00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,570
offloaded and being productive for know

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,430
itself may not know yourself in any

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,340
project who is offloaded to a higher

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:12,630
level responsibility not not someone

00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,250
else comes up with your code of conduct

00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,410
but has some guidance and some help and

00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,240
some resources to make that process for

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,130
y'all a little bit easier to be able to

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,710
run that part of the committee with you

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:26,460
and just a lot of pilots have very few

00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:28,950
people to do all this I mean exercise

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,570
that's something probably online yeah

00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:34,230
yeah well I think a good exercise that

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:36,300
we can take back like you could do it as

00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:45,680
a group just do one initiative meeting

00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:45,680
or if we were to write this

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:47,519
we will see from your experience what

00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:51,569
what initiatives should be wholly owned

00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:54,509
by the you know pretty hands-off wholly

00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:55,709
owned by their individual projects is

00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:57,900
there some things that obviously you

00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:59,880
know the project needed one in order to

00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,739
feel safe and trusted or whatever they

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,269
needed hold on something but then other

00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,400
things that like man I wish we knew this

00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:06,869
before we got started and then you know

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,670
those kinds of things you could capture

00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:10,739
and move up and offer them to other

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,819
projects has like y'all want to do this

00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:24,719
here's the learning that mean

00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:28,229
crystallize roman are messy process so

00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:32,099
that's a little bit of governance the

00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:49,819
the champions for initiatives so

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:49,819
basically yeah we we talked briefly

00:45:58,499 --> 00:46:38,699
if we were to open sentence rather than

00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:47,529
moving scope and we previously with

00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:49,689
there's a word thank you but I think

00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:55,539
really work well there's a lot of

00:46:49,689 --> 00:47:03,419
process to follow a similar pattern of

00:46:55,539 --> 00:47:06,599
what we built out CC putting context

00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:16,749
because people were creating projects

00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:18,999
and meetings and didn't ask and so we

00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:21,159
thought and up happening was didn't have

00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:24,099
a champion on the compound you're saying

00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:26,519
yourself up because you weren't going to

00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:30,089
have the help and assistance necessary

00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,089
to be able to

00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:17,040
I hear students here out one he's

00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:26,860
putting a championship yeah I am putting

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:29,950
that right now else we get you can

00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:36,000
change our level of process previously

00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:41,760
being a differently monster in your

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,760
proposal we voted on people

00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:57,010
now it's there's some magical path

00:48:50,500 --> 00:50:00,660
between initiatives compound it's not

00:48:57,010 --> 00:50:00,660
variable sustained

00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:16,809
sort of a it's a favorite person to buy

00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:56,439
recognition like value you know like an

00:50:16,809 --> 00:51:03,249
expert I mean I will also say the big

00:50:56,439 --> 00:51:10,959
huge ownership was high department like

00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:14,099
actually when the guy I'm bringing the

00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:14,099
context of why does

00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:01,370
[Laughter]

00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:02,420
