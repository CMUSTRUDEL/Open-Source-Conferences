	00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:13,880
so I guess I can just start because yeah

00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:38,340
and no and I found the stick to really

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:43,340
express it for the approach that doe has

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:46,140
for the current doses of this year so

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,160
this is the issue is social some has

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,820
been there for three years nothing has

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,230
happened since then and the reason

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,140
nothing has happened is that because

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,960
it's complicated

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:16,130
so no first thing first physical system

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:26,280
that uses if you used to use doing that

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:36,790
for three years ago and the drum years

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:38,630
have no actually still to build

00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,659
[Music]

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:46,170
continued to build but you'd actually

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,630
tests against note in our continuous

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,880
integration which means we have to find

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,310
a way to film gauge without upgrading

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,899
our own and like updating our little two

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,939
funnels because we stopped doing that

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,530
but still make sure that we can still

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:09,989
build no and another thing to this issue

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:13,590
is that genes the gene team from that

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:16,780
willing to grow in their scope

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:21,579
supporting anything else to show you so

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:26,409
the mix is kind of not nice to switch

00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:28,299
over to change so what we do it where I

00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,359
think what we used to do in the ages we

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:35,200
have to stay in called - - build it was

00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:39,969
GN and his name is Philip yay

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,040
Christian into a second degree and would

00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,799
build the rest of their own which is a

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,469
tool chain and different whistle sound

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:52,090
good and then meddling at the ending

00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:57,129
pose together and work well for us for

00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:00,599
some time but it breaks often and when

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:12,159
it breaks I give you the one who has to

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:18,060
shuffle around see how fine I said well

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:22,780
we think this solution turns out that

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,120
electron actually already ported no TG n

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:31,229
because electron uses known as one of

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,229
these electron uses chrome and chromium

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:37,000
so electron was forced to actually come

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,259
up with Gentiles for known and I was

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,530
thinking hey maybe I can just take it

00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:50,169
and he works but now there was quite a

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:52,329
bit of things missing so June second

00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:58,439
free nice comparative because this is

00:03:52,329 --> 00:04:04,199
just a huge like Tyson object all that

00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:06,729
dr. Parrs GN is actually the same syntax

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,269
the from here is that at a Christian

00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:13,359
France a very incomplete it doesn't have

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:17,799
like a full target or knows executable

00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:20,049
there's nothing was tests it's not like

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:25,710
you can just build it and it works on a

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,710
box and one of the issues is also

00:04:28,010 --> 00:05:34,860
because they were and so from my

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:43,530
perspective the our journey so currently

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:50,039
does this must a fork anybody is welcome

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:54,210
to take a look there so the whole thing

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:58,710
is mostly just a couple of scripts a

00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:05,000
couple of built-up GN files and June I

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:06,289
censored GN o was about were that was

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,789
[Music]

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:12,300
when I was able to achieve from this is

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,640
that the whole thing no continuous

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:24,450
integration going a lot faster

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:28,039
i sees it works on linux mac windows not

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,610
that much because I still haven't gotten

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,610
one use to work

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,890
you know with the candles that there's

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,590
this thing called double bill which

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,900
makes album a lot faster so actually the

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:48,130
little that macro Pro within five

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:52,500
minutes so I also want to talk about

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:56,710
pansies one of the changes I made is

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,540
about managing dependencies for no sir

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,960
for everyone who already work is

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,900
chromium or gate that if you want us to

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,430
set up to it like two thousand poetry

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:25,780
versus things that you have to do is

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:29,320
define which sort of yeah just one line

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,540
like where it comes from and want them

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:46,410
and I'm actually embed them directly

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:49,980
into one for ICU or so as you can see

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,950
those heating and Miller are just

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:57,100
dependencies are often struggling so the

00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:01,330
poor it sounds just a bunch of scripts

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:04,150
and it doesn't actually include the

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:08,230
units but for VA or no or next year

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:13,920
they're the specifies the text when you

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:16,999
get them and so if you want to create

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,999
[Music]

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,600
the and then you add you can sync it

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,860
with an automatically called the right

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:35,140
version of the a you don't have to care

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:39,880
about like compost so the result is that

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:43,030
it raises no bill never party so it's

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,220
easier happy be a letter because all you

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,990
have to do is to change that well it's

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,980
also easy to sync with

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,680
upstream no because no it's just another

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,220
dependency it makes it very easy for us

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:04,149
to have to be a team to test against

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:08,410
note with changing versions because once

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:12,240
again this game build understanding

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,320
tribes are three tiny times are

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,330
undefined if you're sending cards are

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,890
and because they existed like the

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:29,200
configurations for the bill for those

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:33,910
sanitizers are you and also so maybe to

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:38,250
sidetrack double bill is a way to speed

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,750
up compiling a building by just merging

00:09:38,250 --> 00:10:06,610
individual smaller files into bigger

00:09:40,750 --> 00:10:18,300
ones because they are and I haven't

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:21,370
spent the time to dig into and like

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:28,950
combining the stuff from community and

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:28,950
completed the this is strengtheneth

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,540
social future and I'm thinking maybe we

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,250
kind of extreme this that's a secondary

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,180
consistent alongside ship just to make

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:50,649
it easier to maintain not sure whether

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:53,230
the system personally I like it because

00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:59,670
it makes things hear things like

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,670
upgrading easier one

00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:11,140
Oh sweetie ste that not a lot of people

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:13,450
support to which GM is supported and one

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,770
of those ending things in my current

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:20,950
context there's not like another good

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:28,530
implementations for building right now

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:45,010
I'm just doing the it doesn't support by

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:49,540
General Assembly so this is there any

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:53,760
chance thank you yeah is there any

00:11:49,540 --> 00:12:07,270
chance that the GM team will broaden

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:21,100
their support plans yes that would be a

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:23,050
much better solution from yeah I agree

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,690
but for North core it could be a much

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:31,600
better much much better solution so I am

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:37,800
if there is anything in fact we can do

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:59,620
as node to make a case for it I see

00:12:37,800 --> 00:13:06,730
statement you know as access to form a

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:10,540
question we can you know we can work on

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,910
that it is just that

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:17,410
it seems to me especially considering

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:22,150
the electron use case having a single

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:26,290
little system for not God would be way

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,600
way more maintainable and less you know

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,880
wasting work cycles on things that

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,880
should not we should not waste our time

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:43,060
[Music]

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:57,520
when I make sense for us to like not the

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:59,610
default one but those abstain because we

00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,610
are

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:40,470
so I maintain well I guess I needed the

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:44,040
way there are no money talks I could do

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,899
to be built this using Japan there's I

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,010
don't think there's a new upgrade path

00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:55,140
here because if you move expectations

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:57,829
you can we have all those you cannot

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:03,690
repeat them different get them so I

00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:31,980
don't know here you have pushed install

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:35,190
scripts it's the last year when I seem

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:42,540
like the major blocker so I talked to

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:45,510
the electrons life it seemed like the

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,240
major blocker or switching over note for

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,010
would probably denote WebKit because

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,860
it's the Nazi structure thing works

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,720
obviously I mean well we don't mean to

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,260
worry about native models as much

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,720
because don't use the same build system

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:22,319
and they keep using Jim at least driver

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:26,010
for now so I'm not sure I know if you

00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:33,300
ask Shelley or she might know okay

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:35,450
yeah like anything in that area subtract

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,000
so last time I talked to her she was

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:40,710
happy that I'm doing it but she didn't

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,420
tell me anything about it

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,790
I'm sure they like taunting is not

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:56,370
deserving to do this to go so yeah I

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:59,790
also have sugar so one of the things I'm

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,660
still doing here here is that building

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,660
nations

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:12,500
they are still built using all I'm doing

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:20,870
there is to refer to the to the years

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:26,220
against risk and that's also one of

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:28,050
places that doesn't work with us because

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:33,240
we just don't have the correct key

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:35,450
chains without just four points and one

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,700
nice thing about GM is actually that

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,580
part of the dependency management you

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,680
have to get the tool chain and to like

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,760
to share configuration this is

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,650
dependencies so you always know that it

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,080
will go because it just brings its own

00:17:49,650 --> 00:18:01,070
we'll check with it of course that means

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:32,100
that and just to have it as part of

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:35,120
building one my tools for gypsy is to be

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,120
able to consume

00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:44,440
and

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,440
