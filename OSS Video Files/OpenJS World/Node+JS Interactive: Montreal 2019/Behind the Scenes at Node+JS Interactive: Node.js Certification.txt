hi I'm Dave hey I'm Andrea and we talked

00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,099
about the certification in the keynote

00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,990
before Jess interacted it was launched

00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:22,449
in Auburn

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:24,279
yeah and I'm in an f1 capacity worked on

00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:28,029
the technical side of things in Adrienne

00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:31,269
that we do the operational side Anna and

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:33,730
daughters yeah and yeah we just wanted

00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:37,480
to sort of introduce a little bit about

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,710
it and sort of say what it is what to

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,200
expect so there's actually two

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:44,970
certifications right yes so we have two

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,110
certifications one is really basically

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:53,410
the open jets no application developer

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,050
and no open jets no services developed

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,770
but no application developer is about

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,320
checking for over

00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,840
competency for any type of note

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,879
application whether it's even which

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,460
things like build tools or real time

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,850
applications or servers we check for an

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,770
intersection of skills and then the

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,040
other one is the other one is this

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:21,800
services so this is for restful services

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,540
you have to be actually web servers the

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,300
regular common application that you will

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,840
feel and not see is these were all

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,750
sector security cover practice opera

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,280
these kind of applications yeah so

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,770
that's about checking like practical

00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,580
everyday effectiveness for like one of

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,700
the most common use cases of note so if
