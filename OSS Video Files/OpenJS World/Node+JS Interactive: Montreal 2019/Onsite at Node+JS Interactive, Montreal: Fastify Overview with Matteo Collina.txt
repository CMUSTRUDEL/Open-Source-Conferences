hi everyone I am Mateo Kalina I am

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:15,320
technical director at mere four I am

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,279
also a member of the node.js technical

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,939
steering committee and one of the end of

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,800
the open Jes cross process council

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:27,220
however I mean today because I am also

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,699
one of the developers of FASTA file

00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,310
which team

00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:36,230
just recently joined the Open Science

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:39,680
Foundation as information product what

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,140
is pacified first if I is a web

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,580
framework note with the focus with a

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,809
strong focus on performance and

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,580
developer experience at the same time

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,780
because we think that you should not

00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,510
really compromise

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,040
you know they developer experience to

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,920
achieve the best performance that you

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,890
can get from the joyous and first if I

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,500
offer a very low overhead an extremely

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,189
low overt while framework compared to

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,110
not god essentially if it's really your

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,300
application will run as fast and not as

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,300
not care with various management as

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,360
little impact impossible as possible in

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,360
your

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:24,110
in your application so anyway

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:29,420
what is Festa Phi so first if I provides

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:32,930
is we started FASTA file in 2016 and I

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:36,320
was it was a back then I was thinking of

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,690
building what framework for now because

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,490
I was not really happy with the sound

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,530
aware of the ecosystem was going and

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,320
however I started it with a very

00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,869
specific thing in mind I started out

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,880
saying well the first thing I need to do

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,670
to do a web framework is to find some

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,520
other contributors to work with me on

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,800
this of this insane because you know

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,030
writing a web framework consider all the

00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,390
complexity of our complexities of HTTP

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,910
it's a gag and told a spec it's insane

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,369
so I wanted to build a community first

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:15,410
so first if I was born as a community

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:17,300
rather than an open-source project and

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,950
it was tragic at the beginning and this

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,569
is why it fits into the open Jas model

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,090
of open governance and open

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,879
collaboration because it was built as a

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,829
community first it was not built as

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,659
it was not built as an open-source

00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,750
project within my knee and push down to

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,349
the word it was bill okay let's welcome

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,879
people

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,829
okay we need we needs to meet

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,469
everybody's Franklin because one of the

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:46,950
key problem in maintenance and long-term

00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,659
stability of a project is on making sure

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,280
that you know onboarding new

00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,530
collaborators and making sure that the

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,959
load of maintaining the food project is

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,239
spread among as much as as much people

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,400
as possible and as much companies as

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,280
possible so it's a big circle you see

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,139
into you know I expect if somebody wants

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,209
to adopt justify and justify their

00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,099
system I expect them to send

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,989
contribution back to the project because

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,900
I'm not so little part for them like

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,700
okay - one thing I work for me often we

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,159
are a professional services company so

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,980
I'm definitely happy to feature bugs and

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,980
festivai but in a unit family sorry

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,189
and if you want if you like to

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,409
contribute to the project and so on help

00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,599
out grow you're more than welcome to

00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,950
in fact that's at the third way so if

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,530
you are a five if you have a problem I

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,209
want you to join and this is Jesus

impact the different was so much and

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,540
we're able to grow in adoption and

00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,459
in what the friend does because of this

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,650
contribution of cinnamon taenia for

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,950
principle of faster form of performance

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,930
and developer experience and it has been

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,730
doing great the famous is going is

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,629

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:08,269
2016 and you know it's we never know

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,819
what none of us could actually predict

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,319
what would have this really grow and

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,299
