hi I'm Michael Dawson IBM's community

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,059
lead for no Jess and we're just at the

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,269
end of a great note plus Jess

00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:15,820
interactive for 2019 and I'm just

00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:18,039
thinking about you know all the the way

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,350
that sort of the node and the community

00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,480
has matured over the years I think it

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,280
was back at Portland where we had the

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,980
first one and just to see the

00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,420
progression of the talks and just the

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,430
whole community over the number of years

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,600
is really interesting and also to see

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,059
all the things we've been working on

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,070
things like Diagnostics and things like

00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,930
threading and things like I guess all

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,490
the other things that aren't coming to

00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,870
me but they're just so much stuff we've

00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,720
been working on in the community to see

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,280
the talks and the people excited and

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,470
talking about how they're using them and

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,230
that you know when I when I talk to

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,970
people now it's it's so much less of the

00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,950
people say hang on crying out no but

00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,899
that I'm actually using node in my work

00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,180
and in my business and it's great to

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,420
have seen sort of the evolution over all

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,420
