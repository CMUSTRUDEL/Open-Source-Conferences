hi everyone my name is Darren Tyler my

00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,049
developer okay that's Nick I'm also

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,059
heavily involved with a security working

00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:16,610
group for the node foundation so trying

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,920
to do some processes and trying to help

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,320
security and p.m. ecosystem and nodejs

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,300
as well so this conference has been

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,710
really great in terms of you know just

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,390
meeting people getting together getting

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,470
stuff done as well the collaborators

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,660
tell me that you're looking forward to

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,279
in the next couple of days and a couple

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,540
of things so maybe like three things

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,949
that I wanted to like update you on

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,710
what's been going on we didn't know what

00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:39,110
security working group so first off one

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,330
thing that we have been as kind of like

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,769
communicating a lot is we actually

00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,409
received funding for the node working

00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:47,420
group in terms of our ability to like

00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:49,729
work with hacker one and then reward

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,690
security researchers on any bad

00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,489
volunteers you know that they've been

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,629
submitting this is something that has

00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:56,089
been rolling out actually pretty

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,890
recently we've been able to like get a

00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,110
criteria for which models would be

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,909
eligible to get the bounties for and

00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,229
this way trying to like get more

00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,560
awareness and more security researchers

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,970
happening getting involved within the

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,040
security space for node and NPM itself

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,140
it is really good something that's

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,230
really recently going on and really good

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,240
for us as the Necker system interesting

00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,610
point of that we're trying to see if we

00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,840
can maybe divert some of those funds to

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,280
maintenance as well that will

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
participate it's like we kind of trying

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,230
to like pay both parties in terms of

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,910
driving some motivation around not just

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,040
reporting issues but also supporting

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,300
it's like the maintainer is to spend

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
time fixing it so it's a really

00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,480
important project we're going to see

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,240
with hacker one how we gonna be able to

00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,909
our roll this out as well another update

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,890
on the working group itself is since

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,440
this whole open Jas foundation thing

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,060
have been going on really strong

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,490
together a great you know message I

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,600
think for the whole JavaScript ecosystem

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,400
we're trying to see how we were able to

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,310
get some responsible disclosure

00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,590
guidelines set up not just for the node

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,290
foundation but also for the entire like

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,700
cross project Council in terms of like

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,310
the whole open jazz foundation and whole

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,710
20 projects that we have in so how do we

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,899
like I make those standards work for

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,269
everyone as well and not just be a

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,910
particular part of the node as part of

00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,890
it so this is something that Morrison

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,420
from the working group has been going to

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,720
like send off a draft and you'll make

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,280
this

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,770
work if you want to get involved have

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
any opinions we'll help out just jump

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,450
onto

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,490
github.com / node.js slash security - WG

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,350
and I just find us on DHT key we'll be

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,240
happy to get some external eyes and this

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,530
as well and generally if you want to

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,270
just get involved and see what's going

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,490
on everything is very transparent just

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,590
hop on the repository with me is you

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,960
know pretty I think clear and helpful so

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,720
you know just just think after maybe the

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,950
last update would be around kind of like

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,790
a challenging thing that we have been

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,860
kind of been raised recently is we have

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,770
some issues in terms of how do we handle

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,450
large-scale disclosures so what we've

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,010
been seeing not a whole lot but it has

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,350
been happening a couple of times at

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,390
least is security researchers mostly

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,220
from academia have been doing a lot of

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,530
security research around like real

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,050
ordinary like local expression denial of

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,430
service and other kind of like Pat

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,230
reversals kind of double inner bility

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,480
it's like different kind of classes but

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,340
I've been able to like find those and

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,590
disclose those issues across like

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,990
hundreds of projects or like NPM modules

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,600
so how do we as security working group

00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,730
are able to handle those disclosures at

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,630
larger scale because each of those kind

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:31,519
of map into one or two you know reports

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,900
that we have to do so like having

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,060
hundreds of them I mean it's also

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,670
hundreds of like an h1 before that we

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,320
have to roll out it has been an

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,700
interesting discussion ourselves well if

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,739
you want to jump in and see if you wanna

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,050
I just help out or you know a flesh out

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,790
some of the interesting areas to kind of

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,549
take action on but it's also something

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,670
that with being a doubling with recently

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:55,160
so that's it for me hoping to catch up

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,090
with you on social media or on OJ's

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,090
