	Keynote: Game Design Thinking + Social Justice - Ashlyn Sparrow, Assistant Director, Weston Game Lab at University of Chicago

Games are the largest cultural and entertainment forms of our time. Pre-Covid, thousands of players would gather in parks to play Pokémon Go, or in large stadiums to see international teams play a game of League of Legends. These numbers have continued to grow with games like Animal Crossing: New Horizon, selling more than 26 million copies since March 2020, and over half a billion users playing Among Us in November 2020. Games have consumed much of our time, attention, and capital. Games are so popular, that they have begun to influence our everyday lives. The practice of “gamification”, using game mechanics in traditionally nongame activities, is all around us. Fitocracy, Fitbit, and MyFitnessPal, Nike+ have gamified exercise, Khan Academy gamified education and learning, while consumer rewards programs, have even gamified loyalty. The language of competition, leaderboards, and points have taken over mundane aspects of our lives. But, can we use games and game design thinking to shift our relationship to the world and design a more just society?

In this session, Sparrow will reorienting the affordances of games and invite participants to think critically about how our society has been designed, who it’s been designed for, and who it’s been designed by.

hello everyone my name is ashlyn sparrow

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
i'm the assistant director of the westin

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,599
game lab at the university of chicago

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
i am a game designer an experienced

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,240
designer and basically a person whose

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
trajectory in games has been the road

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,199
less traveled and honestly

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
i that's it you know that in itself has

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,680
allowed me to think about interaction

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
design

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,279
and frameworks in a way that i think is

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
a little bit more playful

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,320
but before we get started let us define

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,960
our terms

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
we must answer the question why games

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
right

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,079
games are a huge cultural phenomenon and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
so much so that there is 1.82 billion

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,640
self-identified gamers out there in the

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
world

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,680
and games are one of the fastest growing

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,879
cultural forms

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
97 percent of teens play games uh the

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,399
average age of a gamer

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,000
is 37 and 43 percent of american women

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
are gamers and just

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,120
in 2020 alone the games industry has

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,479
grossed

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,479
139.7 billion dollars

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,320
grand theft auto a very popular game

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
that was released in 2013

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,520
uh grossed one billion dollars in the

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
first three days

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,159
pokemon go was downloaded 550 million

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,280
times in the first couple months

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,600
minecraft has sold 200 million copies

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
it was more profitable than the avengers

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
in game

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
even if you don't count the merchandise

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
um and in 2014

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
mojang and the minecraft ip were

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,079
purchased by microsoft

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,079
for 2.5 billion dollars

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
uh between september 1st and 14th of

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,479
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,880
among us was downloaded 42 million times

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,560
and overall it was downloaded 264

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,560
million times in 2020.

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
uh in early 2020 it was revealed that

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
gamers have put in

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
25 billion hours into call of duty games

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,920
the entire series

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,319
to put this in perspective for you the

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
human civilization is only 6 000 years

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
old

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
homo sapiens have been around for 200

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,840
000 years

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,840
uh call of duty 2.85 billion

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
years

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,599
uh league of legends uh is now one of

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
the most popular pc games in the world

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,879
with gamers logging over 1.3 billion

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,519
hours of gameplay

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,480
and games are moving beyond the screen

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
and permeating

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
other artistic and cultural forms riot

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
games has

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
tapped into the k-pop industry and has

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,560
actually created a

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
group called kda which is what you see

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
here

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
with their music video pop stars it

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
imagines

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
four of the characters as a critically

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
acclaimed k-pop

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,080
group when the video first dropped on

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
youtube it exceeded

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
20 million views in the first four days

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
and

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
reached number five on the apple music

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,440
pop charts uh in the us

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,519
performing better than any other league

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,280
of legends music video

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,760
and note there are quite a few bands

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,400
that riot has produced

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
and so as you can kind of see games are

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,159
all

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,239
around us they are permeating our music

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,879
um our phones everything so much so

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,360
that we are actually also seeing a huge

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,480
movement in terms of gamification

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,879
and gamification is when you take game

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
elements and use them for non-game

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
purposes

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,040
so when we think of fitbit or nike plus

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,480
how they're there they give you points

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
that they give you stars and

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,439
achievements for things

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,159
uh khan academy gives you badges for

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,159
watching certain videos and uh taking

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,680
tests and doing those things right

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,720
so any time you see those elements

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,000
you're probably in a gamified system

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,959
and so they're so popular right that

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
now it's like well games are everywhere

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,560
games are everything

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,000
but we have to also ask this question

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,080
what is a game

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
um there are multiple definitions of the

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,600
game but my personal favorite

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,880
definition comes from jasper yules

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,880
in his book half-life a game is a

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,759
rule-based system with a variable and

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
quantifiable

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
outcome where outcomes are assigned

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
different values

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
the player exerts effort in order to

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,479
influence the outcome

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,560
the player feels emotionally attached to

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
the outcome and the consequences of the

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,360
activity

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,800
are negotiable and so this definition

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,120
uh has no mention of

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
a medium right because games are

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
transmedial

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
there's no single game medium there are

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
multiple game media

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,479
each with its own kind of strengths

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,240
right there's the computer there are

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
board games and card games

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,919
you can also think of the real world as

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,479
a game platform

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
to be used um and so that's the one

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
reason why i love this definition and

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
also the fact that it's

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,240
so broad they're basically only six

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,919
elements to a game

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,680
right the fixed rules that have to be

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,360
really well defined right the number of

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
arguments that you probably get into

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,199
with people when you start to play uno

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,039
it's probably insane right you have to

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
have clear rules how are you going to

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
play

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,360
your game of uno versus what's your

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320
house rules what's the actual rules

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
et cetera et cetera right um the games

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,919
have a variable and quantifiable outcome

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,360
right for the game to work uh the game

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,919
should provide different outcomes right

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,880
you do this you get outcome a you do

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,000
something else you get outcome b

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,280
there's a valorization of the outcome

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
that means that some of the outcomes are

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
better than others right that's how you

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
get winning or losing or maybe with

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
games that you just complete there are

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,319
good endings that that endings are

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
better endings etc

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,720
uh players must exert effort um all

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
games have a challenge

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
to them they're you know they are

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
interactive in some way

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,520
if there isn't this level of effort or

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,639
interactivity

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,440
those are simulations players are also

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
attached

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,720
to those outcomes right they care about

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,919
them it's a psychological thing

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,440
and then the consequences are

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,919
negotiable there's a degree of

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,960
separation from the rest of the world

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,639
following the consequences of the game

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,080
they're all negotiable

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,080
um but but that that that separation

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
is the thing that's negotiable right

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
where you could play a game of poker you

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,120
could bet

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
real world money and you know your bank

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
account goes negative

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
or you can not bet reward money right

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,479
and that consequence right there

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,800
is based off of what the player actually

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
wants

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
and so then you know with this i'm kind

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,599
of curious

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
with with how life is set up could we

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,440
actually think of

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,319
life as a game right life does have

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,120
you know rules uh we care about certain

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
outcomes

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
for certain actions that we take whether

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,360
it's a test or going on a date

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,280
um you know we have to exert effort into

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,599
everything that we do

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
we're attached to our outcomes and

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,360
depending on what it is that we're doing

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,199
the consequences really are negotiable

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
and so i'm really interested in thinking

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,039
about how we can take the games game

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,160
design principles and use them

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,360
in the real world and start making it

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
more equitable

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,360
and just system so a design question

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,400
that i might say i might ask is how

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
might play

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
in game design influence our social

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,199
cultural systems

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,120
well they sort of kind of already are in

00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
weird ways like i said before games are

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
kind of

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,080
everywhere and the way that people are

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,280
interacting especially on the internet

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,479
is very game-like to be quite honest

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,800
uh for instance take q anon

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,759
the right-wing conspiracy uh theory

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
group

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
um the way that i'm gonna describe it to

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
you is gonna sound very much

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,520
like a game that there is an anonymous

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,039
person

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,080
known as q who has managed to find

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,120
secrets about the deep state

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
that contain information about a group

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
of

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,640
democrats and hollywood actors

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
who are conducting violence on children

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
and the only person who can

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
save them and save us all is donald

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
trump

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
how does that work their motto you have

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
to do your own

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
research there are times where there are

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
random drops

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,600
in the real world where you have to go

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
to a physical physical location and you

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
might receive

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
a cryptic clue or message that you then

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,920
have to decode

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,160
for yourself there's a group of people

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,200
online who are trying to decode that

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
message and

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
try and figure out what it all means it

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
operates

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
like what we'd call as an alternate

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
reality

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
game right where it's a conspiracy that

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
you're trying to follow and trying to

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,680
figure out and uncover the mystery

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,959
right there's an investigation they've

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,600
managed to gamify

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
research if only they managed to gamify

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,800
research

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,360
for social good another example

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
uh that i think is uh kind of more

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
positive

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,160
and interesting but also kind of weird

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,320
uh is what happened with

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
wall street bets uh the group of

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,360
redditors who decided to

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,279
take down wall street by betting or by

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,240
uh investing buying stock from gamestop

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,440
um because a group of investors were

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
betting against

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
gamestop uh what's interesting with this

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,120
group is that

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,120
they like good gamers understood

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
the rules of engagement they understood

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,760
the stock market

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,720
and they decided to uh play wall

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,079
street's game but

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
use their same energy but use it against

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,000
them

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
right uh and because of this uh

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
there are quite a few companies that

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
went under because

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
you know they sh they had to sell back

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
their stock which is

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
kind of fascinating to me so i like the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,360
energy of wall street vets

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,240
uh i would like to see them do things

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
for again

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,640
social good imagine what we could do

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,760
with climate change with the same energy

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,360
that wall street

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,640
has so this leads us nicely to

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,640
games and social impact and

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
the types of games that i'm gonna

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
specifically focus on

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,320
are what we call serious games

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
um and these are games that are uh

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,720
designed for a purpose

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,079
outside of entertainment uh this term

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,560
came from clark act in the 1970s um they

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,320
evolved out of his long dual fascination

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,480
with scientific problems

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
and then dramatic human conflicts on the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,399
other

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,480
and so you know i design serious games

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,399
all the time in my lab

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,760
and we talk about uh a lot of different

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:25,839
uh affordances of the games in the game

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,640
space um that again kind of similar to

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
uh yule's definition of what a game is

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,760
the games are

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,360
really good at providing player agency

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,839
right players must exert

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,920
effort which then means games are really

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,480
good at providing players agency

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
right players know when they can or

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
cannot do something

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,440
um when they can make change to

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
something or when they cannot

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
right and that's really really powerful

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
and really really important

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
there are a lot of times where in the

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
real world people don't feel like they

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,440
have

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,120
agency they don't feel like they have

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,160
choice or power right

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
so how could we start thinking about

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279
changing some of our systems in the real

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
world

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,839
to make sure that people do have power

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,519
do have agency do have choice

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
games are really good for trial and

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,120
error right like

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,040
you can try something you can fail you

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
can put on a different strategy and it's

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,959
totally fine right

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,399
a game tells you you've lost or you've

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
failed or you've died

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,680
not to punish a player but to really say

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
hey

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
what you just did didn't really work

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
maybe you should try again

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
right which then means it's just pick a

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,279
space for

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,519
safe uh failure um

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
can't fail tests in school multiple

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
times right

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,240
like there are too many negative

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
consequences for that

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,200
and there's no safety net after that um

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
and they're really good at depicting

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,680
systems like extraordinarily well like

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,600
you can build galaxies and universes

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,480
in games which is kind of cool

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,760
um one other thing that we talk about in

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
terms of game

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,040
are called it's called procedural

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
rhetoric this is a term

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
um from the game theorist eric zimmerman

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
um

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,279
which mainly talks about how

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,839
games uh can persuade people through

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
rule-based representation right so in

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,959
the wor

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
in for instance we have the written word

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,920
and we have rhetoric there and how we

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
can persuade people with our words and

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
how we write

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,720
games make their persuasive arguments

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
through the rules

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,160
right and so maybe if we started

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
thinking about the

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,040
systems that we interact with and the

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
rules that we have to engage in

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,440
that they actually do make meaning

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,160
behind them right

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
who are the types of people who get tech

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,160
jobs

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,880
right do they have to go to certain

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
colleges

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
where are people looking like what are

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
the rules

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
and how you recruit how you look at

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
resumes right

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,959
and that will tell you based off of

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,440
who's hired

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,360
is this is this a place that other

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
people feel like they can be a part of

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
right what are the rules telling people

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,240
right

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,519
based off of what they see based off of

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
how they interact right

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,079
so

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
a thought more of a philosophical

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,360
question

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
can social systems be thought of like a

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,839
game

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,760
let's try and think of this

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,800
let's take voting for instance voting

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,199
is it a game i think not but

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
maybe kind of is if we if we look at

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,600
gerrymandering for instance

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,120
like we know that you depending on where

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,160
you are if you're if you're

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,880
you know identify as blue or red

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,720
um that depending on how the district

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,120
lines are drawn

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,639
that it can change the vote

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,279
if i view this as a game that doesn't

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
seem

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,040
fair it doesn't seem equitable

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,959
in order for it to be fair and to be

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,040
equitable you would want to do

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,839
exactly what you see in on in version

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,560
one it's a perfect representation

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,560
this the numbers are equal across all

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,360
districts the districts are all the same

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,639
size right and then you can count based

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
off of the majority

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,920
here you see blue wins the second

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,519
version while blue does win

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,480
uh it's compact and unfair why

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,240
because it's not equitable about the

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
number of red that that's in the same

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
space

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,839
right and then three is not equitable

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,360
either that's not a fair game

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,399
if we think less about ourselves as

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,519
individuals

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,519
the way that a lot of politicians do

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
and we think more about our players our

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,920
constituents our

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,800
gamer or like our gamers right and we

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,920
want to make sure

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,079
but again it's not it's not just one

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,720
type of gamer it's all the gamers

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,560
that are playing our game that we need

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
to actually balance the system out we

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,639
need to actually make it

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,800
fair i also think about this in terms of

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,279
you know how race was constructed in the

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
united states that it did not have to be

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,079
this way but

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
the us has decided um through and

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,959
throughout history that

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,279
certain people were not welcomed in

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,839
spaces right and that's why you had

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,040
white

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,600
whites only spaces or black only spaces

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,880
why people could not marry outside of

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,560
each other's race

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,519
right people certain people couldn't

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,759
obtain jobs right people couldn't vote

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,600
and so it didn't actually have to be

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,519
designed this way

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,920
but it was it then also cascaded into

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,880
who could get loans to get house to get

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,160
houses

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,759
right it's all sort of crazy and this

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
means that

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
these are all elements of what we call

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,160
structural violence

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,880
right these are political and economic

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,279
and social policies that are created

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
that create inequities policies are

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
nothing more than rules

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
and the people who are playing and

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
interacting in these systems

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,919
are our players and it's unfair for our

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
players

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
and again none of these designs are

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,360
innate

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,439
but unfortunately they all have real

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,799
world consequences

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,439
so again how might we redesign

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,319
systems with a focus towards the future

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
how can we

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,079
use the knowledge of game design and

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
game design thinking making things

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,160
sure that are fun or engaging or fair

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
and equitable

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
easy access the onboarding process is

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
really

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,760
nice and that regardless of like your

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,120
immutable qualities that you still have

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,799
a fair chance of navigating said system

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
there are so many different things that

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,799
a game designer thinks about

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
right the aesthetics how it looks the

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
mechanics the actions that the player

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,520
takes

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
how those actions interact with one

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,480
another and form dynamics

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,240
the narratives of how people interact

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
with these systems the communities that

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
form around it

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,840
right there's so many things and most

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
importantly we have to think about the

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,440
social cultural implications

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,160
and i know that i gave huge uh

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
overarching systems that you know might

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
be hard to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,320
focus on but think about what you could

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
do

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,200
as an individual right at the individual

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,360
level

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
maybe they're maybe you can focus on

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,559
your own

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,679
biases and say like huh is that do i

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,640
surround myself with

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
the other people who just look like me

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
is my

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,360
company full of people who only look

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
like me

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
how can i go and find people who are

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,960
different and talk to them

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,679
right because it all starts with

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,640
self-awareness

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,160
it also means that you need to seek

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
different perspectives just like a good

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,559
game designer a game designer tests

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
their game

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
with multiple people and not only people

00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,679
who are

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
experts at the game but people who are

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,840
not experts that's why difficulty levels

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,080
exist right and one thing that

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,440
game designers do all the time is they

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,559
ask the question

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
why why do you feel this way why do i as

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,400
a game designer feel this way when i

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
hear

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,840
maybe negative comments about my game

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
why

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,600
do i feel uncomfortable why do you feel

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,600
uncomfortable

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,880
right it's really important to start to

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,120
diagnose that

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,120
and then think about ways that like what

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,919
happens if you swap out

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,240
uh the individual for a different person

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,880
or

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,640
a one problem for another do you still

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,679
feel the same way

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,240
if you don't feel the same way why is

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,160
that

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
if we focus on your community if we

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
focus on your company

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,440
right you can think about diversifying

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
your team

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,760
like an rpg right you have a wizard you

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,720
have a sorcerer which is technically

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,640
different

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,919
uh you have um a a warrior

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,960
right a bard right what does your team

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
look like right what skill sets does

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
your team have what background does your

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,360
team have what knowledge does your team

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
have

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
and think about adding new people as you

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
know adding

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:18,000
adding to your culture right

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,280
don't be afraid uh to you know

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,799
reconfigure try something new and most

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,600
important

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,440
i think you have to listen and trust the

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
most marginalized people the people on

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
the edge cases

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
because those are the people who you're

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,640
excluding the most

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,919
those are the people who might actually

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
be able to provide you

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
more insight in the experience that

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,280
you're ultimately designing

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,520
and making sure that it's fair and

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,320
equitable for everyone

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,679
right so i encourage everyone to think

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,480
like a game designer

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,039
make sure that you know you're going out

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
talking

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,120
changing your perspective uh interacting

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,280
with new people and don't be afraid to

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
say you know what i don't know or oh i'm

00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
wrong

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,520
i will i will actually change things to

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,400
make sure that you're included

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,200
because i care because you want a fun

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,760
inclusive

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,039
enjoyable experience it's not all a

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
competition it's not

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,799
all a zero-sum game collaboration and

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,840
cooperative games exists too

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,720
and maybe the systems that we interact

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,960
with can also be collaborative too

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
