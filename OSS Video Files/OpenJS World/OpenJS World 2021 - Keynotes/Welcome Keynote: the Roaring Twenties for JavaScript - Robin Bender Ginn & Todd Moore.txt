00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
todd you and i have been working in open

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,840
source for a long time

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
let's just say we have some historical

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,079
perspective

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,520
yes javascript as an example was created

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,480
over 25 years ago

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
and uh just for perspective uh at that

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
time

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,920
time google was just getting started and

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,039
amazon sold its first book

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,039
today 96 of the world's websites

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
depend on javascript and it's the number

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,600
one programming language if you look at

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,399
surveys from

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
red hat and stack overflow yeah and you

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
know representing this enormous

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
developer ecosystem is truly a humbling

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
and awesome responsibility

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,119
javascript is used by millions of

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,000
developers around the world

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
it is you know to get a hint of the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
future though i think

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
we need to look back a little bit

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
let's look back a hundred years um

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
definitely before our time

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,799
definitely before our time so the

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,360
roaring 20s the decade of change

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,759
the return to normalcy following the war

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
in the pandemic sparked dramatic changes

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,079
across

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
economies and societies the widespread

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,439
availability of electricity

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
changed the way that people lived and

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,680
worked radio and television connected

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,759
people around the world

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
and women in the u.s finally won the

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
right to vote

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
yet you know what there still continues

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
to be an uphill battle

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,119
on civil rights for many uh fast forward

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,960
2020 wow it was challenging in so many

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,640
ways to our hosted communities at the

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
openjs foundation

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,719
the pandemic it took a toll on our

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
families and businesses

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,119
yet it was uplifting to see how our

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,159
communities joined in the fight against

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,759
inequality and bias in society

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
so moving forward will we see the same

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,480
rate

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
of advancements today in technology and

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,239
society

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
can we keep a 25-year-old technology

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
relevant for the future

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,879
can we overcome systemic bias in the

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
tech industry

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,800
we believe we can you know we are on the

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
precipice

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
of a another set of boom years for

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
javascript

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,040
and this is evidenced by the diverse

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
multi-stakeholder communities

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,440
that make up the openjs foundation we're

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,920
a global community

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,640
just two years ago we created this

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,519
foundation

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,560
through the merger of node.js and the js

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
foundation

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,160
and now look we have 37 javascript

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
projects

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
they include uh important projects such

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
as

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,040
node.js amp electron jquery webpack

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,879
node red appium and for me the pandemic

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,280
brought us closer together you know

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,080
with our co-workers dogs and kids on

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
zoom

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
but what's great is that we are a member

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,400
supported organization

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,519
with companies like ibm google joint

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,760
microsoft godaddy netflix and more you

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
know they provide the financial support

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
and active involvement in our governance

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,040
process

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,040
and you know we're really uh fortunate

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
to be joined by new members supporting

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
us

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,560
american express coinbase

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,319
bloomberg node experts and stream joined

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
us as silver members

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,720
and then we're thrilled that netflix is

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,360
now a gold member of our foundation

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
you know javascript is so core uh to

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
these companies leadership positions in

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,159
the market

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
and by supporting openjs they're

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,599
supporting the

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
infrastructure and long-term growth of

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
these open source javascript projects

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,959
that they rely on

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,239
you know the the pandemic also brought

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,920
us closer to

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,159
our end users our open js projects

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
we saw a dramatic spike in the online

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
commerce and

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
education

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,640
um javascript is just so essential to so

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
many organizations today

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
let's take a closer look at netflix as

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
an end user and contributor to the

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,120
node.js project

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,000
since 2013 and one of the largest scale

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
node.js deployments in production you

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,919
know with

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,600
covid pandemic i can only imagine the

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,639
extra heavy workload on

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,280
the it infrastructure over the past year

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,160
netflix runs a serverless node.js

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
platform

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,759
that powers all the devices and user

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
interfaces

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,199
and all use cases for web applications

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
to support content production

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,880
you know i urge you to tune into netflix

who will share netflix's tips on how to

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
improve your service performance

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,919
we continue to see javascript projects

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
maturing providing stability

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,360

look at a few milestones from our

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680

webdriver v7 celebrated a rewrite of its

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,720
complete code base and typescript

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
webpack 5 continues to stabilize and add

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
new features

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,479
and while lots of action in the node.js

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,639
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,479
and node.js also has a mentorship

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,520
initiative with an opportunity

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,240
with the napi working group and

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
node js also has a free training course

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
to support the

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,479
node.js certification program you know

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,919
the growth and stability of node.js

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,520
is often attributed to the longevity uh

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,360
of the foundation that supports the

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
project now right

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
companies can bet on building their

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
businesses with node.js because

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
you know the node.js maintainers

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,880
entrusted with the project

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,880
ensure that it's remain neutral this has

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,039
helped overcome fractures among

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,600
contributors and the code base

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,479
and and the node.js project is a healthy

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
community

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,240
supported by a diverse set of companies

that have increased the scale and

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
driven framework

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,479
that empowers javascript devs to access

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,919
native platform apis directly devs love

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
this because it streamlines their

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,120
development experience

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,639
happy graduation native script

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,560
so also today we welcome a new project

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
into incubation one that's near to my

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,120
dear to my heart loopback

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,759
we're excited to bring it into the

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,560
openjs foundation loopback is a popular

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
node.js framework for api creation and a

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
platform to build large-scale node.js

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,560
applications

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
it uses proven patterns with typescript

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
and

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
is really a first-class citizen it also

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
supports soap and

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
enterprise databases loopback is

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,759
supported by ibm

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,599
and a broad community outside of it and

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
today almost half of its pull requests

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
come from

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
community members which is really

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
amazing so

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,120
i'd also like to talk about

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
collaboration network our technical

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,800
communities

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,279
also work across projects on areas where

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959
they share obstacles and opportunities

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,800
much like special interest groups that

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,560
you find in other organizations

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,640
collaboration spaces are meant to help

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,360
the community-led efforts reach broader

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
audiences

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
and coordinate stakeholders from across

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
the javascript ecosystem

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,080
our new collaboration network initiative

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
is already taking shape

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
and we approach these groups just like

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,839
we would any open js project

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,120
i think that's really important because

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,839
security is always

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
high on everyone's priority list

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,720
especially these days

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
we recently launched the package

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
vulnerability management and reporting

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,240
collaboration space

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,560
we have project maintainers who are

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
experienced in significant influx of

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,880
issues

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,600
when a new cve is reported on popular

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
libraries in our ecosystem

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
and they hope to manage these more

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,279
efficiently and effectively

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
to increase the trust and relationships

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,360
among security companies researchers

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,560
maintainers and the collective end users

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
of our community

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,279
and consumers of our projects so let's

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,399
look more closely at the openjs

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,040
foundation

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
our goal is to incubate and sustain a

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,839
healthy javascript ecosystem

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
we're a neutral home that advocates for

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,120
programs and policies

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,880
that support open and healthy

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
communities who use and build our

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,360
projects

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,519
of course diversity equity inclusion are

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
clear priorities at openjs

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
yet we recognize we have a long way to

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,600
go

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,079
so as part of these our ongoing efforts

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,160
to

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,120
foster a more inclusive space to

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
collaborate

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
we put some more structure around our

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
dei programs

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,800
so drawing on the leadership of the

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
inclusive naming initiative

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
our foundation and projects have taken

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,519
action to remove harmful language

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,440
in our github repos in a consistent way

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,760
across the industry

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,920
we really invite you to participate in

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
our cross-project council dei working

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,640
group

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,560
so we can better understand issues

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,000
facing underserved communities

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,079
and take clear actions to make progress

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
our node.js training and certification

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,600
is a practical way to serve a borderless

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,760
economy and up level your skills

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
the certification program was developed

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
in partnership with node source and near

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,920
forum

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
is a great way to showcase your

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,040
abilities job market

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,480
and allow companies to find top talent

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,680
we found that this program is already

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,160
making a difference in developers lives

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,880
prosper opara a junior full stack

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,519
engineer

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,360
at deimos cloud in nigeria recently

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,399
shared his experience with the node.js

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
certification

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
prosper said the certification greatly

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
helped improve his confidence and his

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
skills

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
and as a node.js developer and as a team

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
member

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
so that they had more trust in him when

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,880
it was related to the node.js project

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
since he was now certified

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
so to provide greater access to the

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
foundation

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,720
and projects wherever you may live we've

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,279
created a new individual supporter

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
program

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,519
called javascript landia at 25 yearly

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,279
the program provides benefits such as a

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
digital badge to add to your online

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,120
profiles

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,399
recognition on our openjs website

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720

discounts on training certification

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,880
conferences

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
and other exclusive offers and today

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,040
we're also launching

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
our dedicated javascript landia website

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,600
where you uh if you remember can collect

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
badges from your favorite

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
uh openjs javascript projects and hey if

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,760
you remember you can even get a limited

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,920
edition openjs world 2021 badge

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,079
so go visit this wonderful world at

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,040
javascriptlandia.org

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,680
to sign up well and i'd also like to

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,839
mention

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,720
you know governance and accountability

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,200
you know why

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
is an open source foundation like openjs

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
so important

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,800
so let's talk about neutrality and the

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,120
role of foundations play

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
neutrality ensures that no one company

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
controls a piece of open source

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,480
technology that many depend upon

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
it also provides an environment where

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
many will come to support that project

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
it speeds the innovation by making it

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
easier for all to contribute

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
and through a clear transparent project

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,079
project government

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,639
governance is maintained openjs has a

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,360
separate

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
technical and business governance we do

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
this deliberately

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,320
so that we have a thorough separation

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,040
between contributing dues as a member

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
and achieving technical influence we've

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
seen

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,480
more open source community leaders

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
advocate for hosting

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
important technologies under a neutral

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
foundation and that's exactly what we've

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
done here

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,200
let's take a look at open governance in

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
action following up on mateo colina's

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
tweet a

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,040
cool example of open governance is

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,000
fastify fastify was created by mateo

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
at near form and thomas della vadova at

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,720
elastic

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,079
mateo has been an active leader in the

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
openjs foundation

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
and the node.js project and the openjs

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,959
foundation has been a huge fastified

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,199
champ

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,240
to help increase increase the adoption

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,639
of the project

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,440
and attract new contributors and wow

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,040
today fastify has more than 900 000

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,800
downloads per month

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,160
up from 500 000 a year ago and 187

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
plug-ins

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,320
and what's really interesting is mateo

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
said that fastify started before any

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,040
lines of code were written

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,880
in 2016 he met thomas who asked how to

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
get started in open source

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,320
mateo asked him if he wanted to start

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,600
working on a new web framework for

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
node.js

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
fast forward a few years and they have

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,720
built an amazing open community

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,079
at openjs we seek to advance policies

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
where the industry can

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,320
confidently enter javascript's ecosystem

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,160
and one that provides and prioritizes

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
stability and openness

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,079
in the shared technologies while

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,760
recognizing unique needs of individual

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,199
participants

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,279
javascript is open and standardized

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
and implemented in all the major

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,800
browsers

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
so you'll also see many of our leaders

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,839
actively participating

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
with international standards development

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,600
organizations

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
and you know historically they were

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
differing views on open source and open

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
standards

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
with the two efforts sometimes perceived

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
to be out of sync

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,120
this is definitely not the case today

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,800
where community silos are nearly erased

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
so hear what our friends have to say

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
from some leading standards development

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
orgs

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,480
on how our communities are working

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,160
together to make the web

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
better for all thanks robin

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,959
for inviting me to share my excitement

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,639
on the partnership between openjs

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,600
and w3c the web standards body

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,720
we both use the power of open source for

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,680
the benefits of the web and its users

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
so much web technology including browser

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,199
engines

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
are created in open source our

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,120
collaboration

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,279
in technology and methodology bringing

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,839
people together to enhance the web

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,680
is critical to our mission at w3c

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
cherish our partnership and look forward

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
to it increasing it

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,560
as we attract new diverse web

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,800
practitioners

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,800
and work together to address the growing

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,240
amount of work in front of us

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,160
thank you

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
open source projects have a long and

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,240
successful history

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
collaborating with ecma tc39 the

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
committee that standardizes the

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,240
javascript language

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,040
the communities around jquery node

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
webpack

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
moment and others have provided

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
meaningful input

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,839
that has influenced proposals for new

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,480
language features

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
as an ecma member openjs has directly

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
supported this

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,560
valuable feedback loop between open

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
source projects

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,240
and standards empowering maintainers to

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,040
fully participate in standardization

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,920
both organizations work transparently in

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
the open

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
ensuring that all intellectual property

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
is shared with the world

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
and there is always an open seat at the

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,160
table we look forward to improving

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,279
javascript

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,519
together with openjs

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,120
so todd why don't you tell me why are

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
ibm and other member companies

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,639
contributing to the openjs foundation

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,279
ibm and our customers and our users

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,680
today

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,519
rely upon the open source javascript

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,360
projects hosted at the openjs foundation

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,480
there's just no doubt about that

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,920
it's in all our economic interests to

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,440
invest in these technologies they're

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,439
essentially the plumbing

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
that creates the opportunity that we all

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,559
share in

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
ibm also finds it valuable to be part of

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,520
the regular convenings of the javascript

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,640
machine learning and ai are now coming

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,880
to the forefront

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,720
