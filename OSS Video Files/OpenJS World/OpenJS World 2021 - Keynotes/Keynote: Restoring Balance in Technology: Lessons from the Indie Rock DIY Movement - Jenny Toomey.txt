[Music]

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:23,840
let's go

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:25,840
[Music]

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,599
so jenny it's an honor to have you and

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
thanks for allowing us to share some of

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,280
your music up front that's super cool

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,840
uh so question you know i grew up in

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,079
seattle in the 90s where you know grunge

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,239
was big and feminist punk

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
but for those who don't know tell us

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
more about the diy

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
music scene at that time and sort of

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,719
that digital music

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,039
revolution okay um

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
well i grew up in washington dc which is

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
credited as being one of the homes of

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,079
diy

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,680
although diy happens anywhere someone

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,199
teaches themselves how to

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,720
build something um but

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,640
uh you know diy uh

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
every punk scene had a different quality

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
to it um

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
seattle had a really interesting quality

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
because they had

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
pop which became this kind of worldwide

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,479
commercial phenomenon and so they had

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
this sort of

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,560
really interesting small town big world

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
quality to them

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,200
um in dc

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,520
uh you know every every

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
every city has a different quality in dc

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,040
it's the government right so you've got

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
these high-performing globally focused

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,079
individuals

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,119
you know and all of the ngos of the

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
world are there and

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,680
all of the major marches that happened

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
back in the 80s and 90s would all happen

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
in washington so

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,920
it had this kind of mixture of kind of

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
workaholism

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,360
political engagement and sort of a sense

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
that you really were at the center of a

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
place where you could change the world

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
and i think all of those things

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,880
influenced the kids that made up the

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,640
punk scene

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
um and it's hard to even imagine in the

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
same way that like it's hard to imagine

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
a world before

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
all of the sort of major tech that you

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,640
know before google search or any of this

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
kind of stuff

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
but back then when i was in high school

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,319
there really wasn't an infrastructure

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,760
for you know national tours

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,680
um and independent music didn't have

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,800
a place to be played on mainstream radio

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
and some people thought that was really

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
good because you had all these pockets

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
of creativity and a lot of people

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,360
looking

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
um intently at their own scenes and it

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
created this kind of nurturing

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,760
environment

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,200
that sometimes goes away when everyone's

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,560
chasing the big wins

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
that happen but it was a really

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
interesting moment where people were

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,000
basically building everything

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
so if they wanted to put out a record no

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
one was going to put their record out

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,360
because there wasn't a label that cared

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,000
about this stuff so they actually had to

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,239
figure out how to you know do the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
artwork and find the pressing plan and

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
go into the studio and put out the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
records themselves

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
um and because everybody was doing that

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
everyone helped each other do that

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,040
and it created this kind of environment

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
that um was really enabling

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
it's one of the things i love about that

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
technologists and and why i think in my

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
later life i've spent so much time with

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
them

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
is that they have a lot of the same kind

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
of can-do spirit

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
and ability to imagine the future that

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,280
artists have as well

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,519
so that's that's with the dcc and the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,239
diy movement that i came up in

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,159
cool so you sort of uh evolved from sort

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
of you well still a musician but you

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
became an advocate for independent

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
musicians tell me about that

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,599
well i was an advocate before i was a

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
musician so there was a there was an

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
organization called positive force

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
in dc which was really unique in the

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
sense that like a lot of people like

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,159
care about an issue and then they joined

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
greenpeace or they joined some

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
established

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
non-profit organization and and

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
volunteer for them

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,640
um but positive force was basically

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
empowering these really really young

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,760
kids to do whatever

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159
and so it was this collective so if i

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,239
was like a 13 year old and

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,560
i was concerned about suicide or i

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
wanted to put on a concert in a park

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
the 21 year old who was part of the

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
collective would help me go down and get

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
a permit

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
from the local government to have that

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
concert

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
and together we would sort of design the

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
kind of activism we wanted to do

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
ourselves so it was really this crazily

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
empowering environment

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
which was less about like you know

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
someone handing me a clipboard intent

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
telling me to go get a lot of

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,680
signatures outside somebody's you know

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
you know some

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
shop in town it really allowed us to do

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
whatever we wanted to do sometimes it

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
was efficient

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
you know where we do some incredible

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,800
thing like we organized

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
concerts in front of the white house

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
because you could do that back then

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
um and sometimes it was really

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,120
inefficient like we decide we want to

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
feed the homeless so we're going to make

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
a pot of soup and

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
try to find them and hand them soup but

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
what was great was you really could use

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
all of your creativity

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,880
and you really could work on anything

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
you cared about so it was really really

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,600
empowering uh organization

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
so i did that before i was a musician um

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,160
and it was just sort of the water we

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
swam in the the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
positive force did a lot of benefit

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
concerts and uh

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
i started being in bands um and then

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,960
when i came out of that work

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,360
i had this record label um i had put out

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
you know 70 releases with my friend

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
kristen thompson for simple machines

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
records

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
because again no one was going to put

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,919
out my tsunami record so i had to put

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,560
them out myself

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
and i was working at the washington post

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
in a silly

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,840
job where i was writing the ads for uh

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
for the newspaper

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
and i had a fast internet connection and

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
that was really unique back then it's

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,560
hard to imagine that but like

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,880
i had a fast desktop um because i needed

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
it

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
in order to design these ads and in that

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,000
i saw

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
everything beginning like you know my

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
thrift store maven saw ebay for the

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
first time

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,639
like all this stuff was coming in and

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
because we have this catalog

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,320
all the music uh labels that were

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
starting at that time the online music

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
labels

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,319
all came to us and said you know can we

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,919
license your catalog

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
one thing we've been known for when we

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
were in the

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
you know luddite world was we put a

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
guide to putting out records together it

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,440
was like a 16 page thing if you sent us

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
50 cents we put two stamps on it and

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
send it to you and it sort of gave you

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,759
all the recipe of how you put out a res

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
a physical record um and so when we

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,080
started

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
getting all these requests we thought

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,440
all right it's time to update this

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
we need to figure out what's the right

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
thing to recommend for people to do in

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
the digital environment

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
um and we realized you know as we were

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
learning this

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,039
that there were like 60 different

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,960
companies and they had all these rules

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
like you can own your copyrights or you

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
can sign a contract or you don't have to

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,039
sign a contract all these different

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
options but as the bubble burst the

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
first tech bubble

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
all those companies either went out of

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,479
business or merged

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,199
or were purchased by other companies

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,360
and very quickly we saw things like you

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
know the company e-music which had sort

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
of

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,280
created itself as like the renegade punk

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,919
rock

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,639
version of this uh was purchased by

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,319
universal

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,560
music which was like the man

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,240
you know the most major label and what

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,759
we realized was like it's not going to

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
be enough everything's happening

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
it's too early to know what the right

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
things to do in this space are

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,039
so we realized it wasn't enough to say

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
like go to this company or sign this

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,280
kind of contract or do this with your

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,319
copyrights

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
we actually realized it was all

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
happening in real time and so we started

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
a future of music coalition

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
which was specifically trying to

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,960
complexify

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,560
some very simple narratives like all the

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
all of the sort of open copyright people

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
were saying that you know

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,319
any sort of copyright was theft and all

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,440
of the major labels were saying

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
any sharing of anything was theft and

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,319
frankly you know

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,919
we felt that most musicians were

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,960
somewhere you know they didn't want

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,400
everything to be free

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,879
they needed to make a living and they

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,199
also didn't want to give more power

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
to the overlords who had controlled the

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,680
radio and controlled the record labels

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
um so i did that for about seven years

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
and that's how i got the bug um

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
thinking about the way that technology

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,639
was changing everything in the world

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
right yeah i think there's so many

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,599
commonalities from the open source

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
movement which really was sort of

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,599
happening at the same time that you were

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
leading the future music coalition so

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
super interesting

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
um so i mean you look at some of your

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,479
work today

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
you know the world wide web is really

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,479
seen as a public resource

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,759
yet it still often can bring socio

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,800
socioeconomic disparities and other

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
issues

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
so you know sort of bridging what you've

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,279
learned and all that you've brought as

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,039
being an advocate

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,200
what are some of the current challenges

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
you're seeing at the ford foundation and

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
sort of what commonalities

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,360
and sort of threads are you among some

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,040
of these social issues for the web

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
well i mean there's there's so many of

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
them and you know i've been at ford

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,040
forever

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
like you know i basically you know if i

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,360
was a dog when a puppy when i came to

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,640
ford i probably wouldn't be alive

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
anymore

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,200
in touch a long time ago but when i came

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,560
i came actually because i'd received a

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,920
grant from ford to work on these

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
copyright issues because i was sort of

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,160
right at the center of it

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
and um and ford cared about access to

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,959
information

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
and they also cared about artists and

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,200
arts so

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,720
so i i sort of fit that job perfectly um

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,519
and we had a brand new president and he

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,680
said to me uh do you want to work on

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
cultural policy or media policy because

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
the position was called media and

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,440
cultural policy

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
it's like you can't do both we're all

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
doing too many things you can't do both

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
which one and i said i want to work on

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
internet policy

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
and he says well what's that i'm like

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,279
well there's no rules in relation to

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
the internet environment yet he's like

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,480
aren't all those rules already created

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,080
i'm like no no none of them are created

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,360
at all um and so that's how it

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,120
started and so the early challenges

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,399
of the portfolio were that um

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,839
you know a lot of them are the same

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,800
challenges they're just showing up in a

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,040
different way

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,600
but were that technology was

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,360
transforming every aspect of our lives

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
oftentimes in ways that were invisible

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
to the majority of the public

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,160
and all of the systems that try to

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
protect the public

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,800
you know imperfectly at times but in a

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,240
democratic environment so the government

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,079
who can actually sort of regulate

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,880
companies who are acting in bad

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,320
uh in bad ways or civil society

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
organizations like i said greenpeace

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
before who can go out there and

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
try to raise awareness around you know

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
environmental issues

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,040
all of the established protectors

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
of the public for the most part didn't

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
notice

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
that everything was transforming and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
couldn't see it

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
and and the sad fact is that so many of

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
people in positions of power in

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
government

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,519
and in philanthropy and in civil society

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,200
were of an age that they never had that

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
fast internet connection

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
on their desk uh and so they're in

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,480
charge of

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
the world but they don't really

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,880
understand the change

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
and they always think of technology in a

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
transactional way as opposed to in a

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
systems way

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
and so i think that's that was the

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
biggest problem back then that we had no

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
advocates who could actually say you

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
know net neutrality is important because

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
you know if we don't have it it's like

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,440
payola for the entire internet and only

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
the wealthy and connected can actually

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
be on the fast lane

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,360
um we needed people to be able to

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,480
understand those systemic questions

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
back in the day and now uh we we still

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
need it

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,399
you know uh i think the challenge is a

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,079
lot of the people who are in

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
leadership positions are made to feel

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,720
very stupid by technology so they ignore

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,000
it

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,279
and they also think well i'm only going

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
to be here for a couple more years so

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,360
someone after me will fix it and that

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,920
keeps getting kicking it down the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,959
down the road and while that's happening

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,839
the private sector

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,920
is in a completely

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,279
uh it's like a race to the bottom really

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
and not just a race to the bottom among

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,600
themselves but among the world

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
you know so if we're competing with

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,399
companies

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,079
in other parts of the world that don't

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,839
have

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,360
laws around freedom of expression or

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,320
privacy you know

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
they're they're creating their

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
technology to compete with the world in

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
a way

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,720
that um completely uh forgives

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
themselves of any of their

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
responsibilities to the public so

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
those are the really really big

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,000
challenges how do we get technologists

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,160
and not just any

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
but the right kinds of them in all these

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
places

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
so that we can be safe in the future

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
yeah

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
lots i mean there is so much to tackle

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
so how

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,360
has uh what sort of strategies and

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,200
solutions are you implementing

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,800
at the ford foundation to tackle these

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
well there there's a lot i mean some of

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
it's just building a field of experts

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
who can actually say

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,600
oh well you know when this tech company

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,800
says that no one cares about privacy

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,279
this is what they need

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,720
you know and this is why that's wrong or

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,320
they're actually

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
controlling the market in a way where

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
there's no competition if anybody could

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
vote with their

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
feet or their pocketbook they would but

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
there's no market competition in this

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
environment

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
so we need people who can actually make

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,200
the arguments about

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,120
the dangers of of unconstrained or

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,839
or i'd also say like if you're a strong

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
capitalist uncapitalistic

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,959
technology environment because there's

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
really not competition in so many of

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,760
these places you know there's

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,920
such winner take all um power dynamics

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
with some of these companies um but

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
putting all of that aside

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
i think you know the the biggest most

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,720
interesting thing for me right now

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,320
is when i first came to ford i flew out

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,360
to california and i sat with

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
a lot of the companies that seemed to

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
have a civic mind to them like the

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
wikipedias were the

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
kivas you know at that time was a big

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,839
deal that it just started

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,920
and like ask them are you concerned

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,320
about net neutrality you know if

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
um you know if people made you pay a

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
certain amount of money

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,040
to be on the web wouldn't that undermine

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,240
your business model you know

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
wouldn't make it hard for people to

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,040
access this information and what we

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
found is

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,120
there was a bias on the west coast um

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
which most tech companies and most

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
technologists

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,399
felt like tech was always going to be

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,760
speedy efficient

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,079
and would do no evil and if there were

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
any

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,600
problems they would root around it with

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
the technical solution

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,639
and um they really weren't interested in

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,399
washington

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,519
and what we found historically is that

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
most companies aren't interested in

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
washington until they get sued

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
then they get then they get a policy

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
shop and then they spend a lot of time

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
usually publicly denying that they're

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
doing what they're actually doing or

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
trying to change what people think about

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
what they're doing

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
um but what was interesting to me is

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
we've seen this enormous shift and it's

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
really what makes me so optimistic right

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,399
now like open source people always knew

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
that how you design something will

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,240
determine whether

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
it is rights protecting or rights

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,880
undermining they just know

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,240
that and that having competing models is

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
what keeps people honest

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,519
so if someone builds a technology that's

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,000
doing something you don't like

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,800
a technology that does something

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,040
different than that

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,920
gives gives the market the opportunity

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,519
to move

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,399
in a better direction so but but you are

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,800
small

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,000
you you open source people are small in

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
the world in relation to

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
all of the public in the world so what i

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,360
love right now though is that

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,279
all the change in the world whether it

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
is the racial reckoning we're going

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
through

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,040
around the lack of diversity and the way

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
that

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,680
black people have been held down

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
um or women have been you know made to

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
feel

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
uh like second-class citizens in these

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,560
environments

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
or the kinds of scary disinformation

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
that we're seeing and the confusing

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,880
media environment that we're in

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
or the total lack of privacy and the

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,079
constant hacking

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,320
you know and things that we're

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519
experiencing we know something's wrong

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
and what i love is that the

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,440
technologists of this generation are

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,560
less quick to say tech will always be

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
good

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
they understand that it's neither good

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,720
nor bad until we make it so

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,480
and so what i'm seeing is enormous

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
hunger at companies

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,920
uh not at companies at universities

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,079
by students to really take these very

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,920
rare and valuable skills they have and

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,000
to use them in a different way

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,079
that actually um builds the world they

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,720
want to live in as opposed to the one

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,240
that they're afraid of living in and so

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
i do think we're in this kind of

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
critical moment where we're going to

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
have different kinds of technologists

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,120
who are going to come out and go

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
different kinds of places not just to

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
the five companies but out into the

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
world

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,240
and um and hopefully that'll be enough

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
to save us

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,720
i know i had listened to an npr story

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
with you and i think 2004

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,880
and you talked about sort of the voice

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,560
of the musician was lost

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,759
in policy debates um do you think that's

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,759
changing i mean you mentioned

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,959
university students so you do see a

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,279
shift more

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,160
where the individual voice of developers

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
for example and

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,600
those of us in technology have a voice

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,360
yeah i mean i mean the problem with the

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
musicians is like

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
and again this is a little sometimes

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
this is a little bit the open source

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
thing as well

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
is that you know we're so interested in

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,560
what we're interested in

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,720
like we're so interested in writing the

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,959
song or

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
that spectacular song that that other

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,079
person wrote

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,439
that is so much better than your song

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,720
that it kicks your butt and makes you

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
want to write an even better like you're

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,520
so

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,880
focused on the thing that really fires

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
you up and i'm sure the same thing is

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,959
true with

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,959
technology you're so focused on

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,160
that all this other stuff around like

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,959
what is this policy what is this rule

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
what is this

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,280
law you know or um

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,000
you know all that other stuff seems uh

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,760
less pure and kind of distracting from

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,640
what you most care about

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,080
but that and and you know the challenge

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
is that you know in the case of the

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,080
music

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
landscape um it was only too easy

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
for both the major tech companies and

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
the major music companies to find some

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
artists to be mascots

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,240
that stood in front of these positions

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,679
that were really business decisions

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
around like well if it's all open we can

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,320
make all this money off it or if it's

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
all closed we can make this kind of

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
money

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,400
and what i found was frustrating was um

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
you know they would hold up a musician

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,080
and say musicians say this

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,360
and if you've ever met a musician i'm

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,720
sure this is true with the open source

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,600
people because i've been around them

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,600
if you ever have um you know three

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
musicians together there's like 15

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,520
positions

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
on any issue you know they have very

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,160
strong

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,440
and complex positions on things so the

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
idea that you could just say that

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
musicians want this

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
or they don't want this is is a real

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
problem

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,280
um and the fact that they're so focused

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,760
on their art is great for us but it's

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,480
also bad at times because they can be

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,480
uh they would be the best advocates for

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,039
a better world but they're more

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
focused on the world they want to create

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,000
which is in

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
art so that's why we need these hybrids

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
and and what i would say about the

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
technology landscape i'm seeing right

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
now

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
is it's the investments we're making

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
about building this field that we're

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,360
calling the field of public interest

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
technology is focused on investments the

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,240
ford foundation made back in the 60s and

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,679
70s

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
to build the field of public interest

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,160
law and for those of you who are lawyers

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,679
you

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,320
almost can't imagine that there was a

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,640
time where you know the pro the the

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,880
major law firms didn't have a pro bono

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,960
right practice where you could like be

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,640
at a firm and work on capital cases or

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
environmental cases for

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,919
part of your time or that you know there

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,200
are pathways into the aclu or the naacp

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
legal defense fund

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,039
but none of these organizations really

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,840
existed before the investment to build

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,760
them

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
and it was largely built around a

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,160
similar moment

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,080
of cultural tumult

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
and change like the one we're in right

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,000
now but it was the civil rights movement

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,480
and there was a real need to have

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,160
lawyers that could actually defend

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
people who were doing civil disobedience

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
or bring cases around you know voting

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,240
rights and other kinds of

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
issues and so what i love about this

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,520
moment is

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,520
the sort of it's this kind of mutual

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,240
development of a real clear-eyed

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
need to do something different with

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,360
these technology skills and the same way

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,880
in the 60s and 70s these lawyers were

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
like it's not enough for me just to work

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,000
at a law firm at this moment

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,720
so we're seeing that same kind of

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,840
phenomenon and what makes me optimistic

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
about this right now

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,039
is they will find much better solutions

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,159
when they take all that energy they've

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
been focusing on

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,840
i don't know stroking the algorithm

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,280
whatever they were doing and focus on

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,480
actually how to make

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,320
these kinds of systemic changes to how

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,559
you know people get vaccines or how

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,679
people believe in the news

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,400
or how people um can pick

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,080
between social media environments that

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,640
enshrine their privacy rights and don't

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,440
just

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,080
sell all their data to everyone so

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,200
there's just

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
an abundance of of things to work on and

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,559
i think

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
we have i'm seeing just a really

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,039
willingness to do so

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,720
sort of how um from your experience how

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,960
can people organize

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
to prioritize which issues to work on

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,240
when you're trying to account for

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,000
diverse stakeholders

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,320
um what's your experience

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
so every single issue that you could

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
care about

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
has a technical component to it at this

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,919
point this is what i'm always trying to

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
say and this is again this challenge

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,559
that i have when

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,000
i'll go to like talk to a president of a

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,320
foundation or

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,919
you know a head of an ngo and say to

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,159
them you know

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,360
um we really need a technology lens on

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,440
what you're doing

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,960
they'll say oh but we have this person

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,320
who's building this app or who's

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,080
organizing this

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,200
you know flash mob or what you know i

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
know that's outdated but you know the

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
point that i'm meaning is there

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
they think about technology as an

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,880
instrumentalist

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,919
tactical you know tool as opposed to the

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
ecosystem

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,280
right so like a perfect example like the

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,320
first argument i made

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,240
for changing um to have an internet

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,400
rights portfolio at ford

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,080
was like ford had just made like a five

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,840
million dollar investment in npr

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
so that they could begin to develop

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,919
podcasting it'd like

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
it needs to be podcasting and so this

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,039
idea was like how do you take this great

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
content which we listen to on our radio

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,840
and make it something that's actually

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
going to be in the internet environment

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,440
okay well think about that in

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,400
environment of a non-neutral net

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,120
you know public radio has very tight

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
margins

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,880
right imagine if they actually had to

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,679
pay

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,600
for you to be able to access this

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
american life or whatever it was

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,080
um they weren't thinking about the

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
ecosystem that they assumed would stay

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
the same

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,919
in the environment where they were

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
creating the tactical solution and so

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
what i always say to people is like

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
anything you care about if you care

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,799
about reproductive rights and health if

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,640
you care about whether

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
you know working mothers can have health

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,320
care if you

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,280
care about uh the environment every

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,080
single element of this will have

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
technology transforming the ecosystem

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,600
around it

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
and potential tech solutions that could

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
actually create

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
greater problems if they aren't applied

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,000
correctly

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,240
and so what's wonderful is um if

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,840
anybody who is trying to build something

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
they care about or trying to invest in

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,960
something they care about

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,760
it's less about building it in whole

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
cloth by itself like oh this will be the

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,200
solution to that

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,360
as a tool it's more about being with the

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,520
best advocates that you know the most

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,799
impacted populations and saying what's

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,640
not working

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,240
and how do we solve it and what i find

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
is that they're going to be parts of it

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
that are rocket science but a lot of it

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,120
is

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,400
basically just best practice that most

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,440
people who don't have a tech

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
mindset don't have an easy access to

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
understanding how

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
they might approach it so off-the-shelf

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,000
solutions that a private sector person

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,440
would use without thinking

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
are maybe like you know greek to

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
ngos that are underfunded that don't

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,360
have technologists or even

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,159
a lot of our government systems which is

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,159
which is why

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,360
they have such a hard time so that's

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,039
amazing but still

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,799
lots of transferable skills right yes

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,880
i think maybe more so with our open

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,039
source community we are so used to

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
really collaborating with folks with

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,200
their competitors

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
um across countries and things like that

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
so um

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
what would you say to some of these

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,200
folks to maybe encourage them to use

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
their

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,159
skills for the public good for public

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
interest technology or perhaps even

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,360
going to work for the government or an

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,919
ngo

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
well it's never been easier to do this

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
you know what

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
we found like we had to build a lot of

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,640
these systems because we needed the

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,120
technologist

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,039
right so all our grantees when i was a i

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,039
was in the field right i had i was a

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,000
ford grantee before i became a program

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,679
officer

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,120
and um i was so proud of myself

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,240
when i became a program officer because

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,159
i was going to solve everything i had

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,600
this three million dollar budget now

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
and everything was going to be solved

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,200
for the field and

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,039
i'm going to be in the room with the

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,559
funders i can tell them how important

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,400
these issues are

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,720
of course if that is not what happened

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
you know it's been such a hard slog and

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
you know it's amazing like

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,600
you know it's like somebody with an ax

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,880
in their head and you're like you know

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
we need to take that ax out of your head

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
and they're like what acts you know it's

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
just like

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,799
there's so much denial about how the

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
world has been transformed

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,880
or and i think it's just the denial of

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,880
being afraid that you won't know how to

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,159
fix it so i'll fix something else you

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
know like oh i don't know how to get

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,720
this axe out but i'm you know i'll make

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,080
myself a cup of tea because i'm a little

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,799
tired or whatever it is

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
you know but um but yeah the punch line

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,400
about this

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,919
long winded story that i was telling you

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,360
is i had all the grantees that were

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,039
there was about like 10 of them

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
10 organizations working on these issues

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,159
at that time and i said all right

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,600
if you have all the money in the world

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,880
because you do now i've got three

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,640
million dollars right

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
that's all the money you'll ever need to

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,840
save the internet um

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
what else would you need and they all

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,279
said we need technologists

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,200
that understand our issues but that we

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,960
can work with because what we found is

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,039
so many of the engineers and the best of

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
them have usually gone through a cycle

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,960
of

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,120
pure computer science or pure

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
engineering schools without many

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,360
humanities

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,159
and with this sort of tech solutionism

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,240
as a sort of

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
bible that they hold to themselves that

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,799
the tech will always solve these

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,120
problems

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,080
um and what we found was like these

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,320
people often

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,679
didn't have some of the soft skills or

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
the curiosity

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
to be able to figure out how to pick the

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,159
right problem to solve

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
um and or how to work in an environment

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,600
that wasn't you know

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
fast-paced and and you know and then

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,720
there's financial concerns as well like

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,480
you don't make as much money

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,120
if you're working in the government or

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,799
in the ngos but what we found is

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,720
through these pathways and you ask that

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,159
question explicitly so i'll say like

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,919
there are things like um the tech talent

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,520
project

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,360
which is actively done work to try to

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,240
recruit

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
strong technologists to take tours of

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
duty

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,000
within government you know so something

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,279
like this there are a bunch of

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
organizations like this and

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,120
we can find some links and you can link

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
to them somewhere

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,600
um but also ngos are desperate for them

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,720
now like we have a whole tech sellers

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
program we've done now for

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
five years with mozilla where they help

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,600
vet the tech

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,799
chops and we do the sort of partnership

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,720
betting and we put technologists into

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,559
ngos like amnesty international human

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,440
rights watch these are places that by

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,440
the way have

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
nice budgets they actually could hire

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
technologists

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,720
but without the kind of system to figure

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,000
out where to place the technologists and

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,080
what kind of skills

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
for what kind of work usually the first

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,760
one never gets placed unless we can do

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,279
that and if we do it properly

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
then like amnesty has like 20

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,720
technologists now

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,880
um but it takes just sort of someone

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,840
explaining or helping them

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
to find what they need and matchmaking

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,559
and then

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,240
them feeling the joy and what we find is

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,919
that a lot of these technologists like

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
the one at amnesty the first one that

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,640
went came from cisco

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,200
and you know amnesty immediately

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,399
wanted to hire him and he said you know

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,919
it's going to be very hard to go back

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,960
and work in the private sector

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,919
after um after having the experience of

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,279
the kind of

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,799
meaningful work that i'm doing here

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
amazing i was going to ask for some of

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,159
your favorite examples but it sounds

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,600
like you have so many with ones you just

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
shared do you have any others you'd love

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
to

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,120
you know there is this amazing article

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,240
that you can google

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,840
in the atlantic about um

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,640
it's a project called 18f and it was

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,559
set up it was set up in the aftermath of

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,440
the failure of the healthycare.gov

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,640
website

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,080
um and it was a way that the government

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
figured out how to recruit a different

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,000
kind of talent in at a moment of crisis

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,039
um and this article

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,480
about these folks in an airbnb in

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
i think it was like in crystal city or

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
clarendon which is right across the

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,720
river from washington

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,200
solving the technical problems for like

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,039
pennies on the hundred dollar bills of

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,960
what was initially spent

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
uh is just such an exciting i feel like

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
for me it's like an

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,520
action film like why didn't i reading

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,720
this article

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,200
and and again over and over again we've

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,559
heard

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
from individuals who've gone through

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,399
these as long as they're placed well

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,720
and treated with respect which part of

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,919
what was interesting about 18f was

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,279
there wasn't a requirement that um

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,360
there wasn't a guarantee that you'd get

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
an 18f person you actually had to agree

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
to certain things like you had to agree

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,000
to place them at a certain level and

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,640
give them a certain level of power

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
within

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,960
an agency and this actually meant that

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,559
they could actually make the kinds of

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,159
changes they needed to make

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,919
at a systemic level because government i

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,799
think and rightly so

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,600
is conservative it's worried if we do

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,679
the wrong thing

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,360
all these downstream harms will happen

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,840
but sometimes that creates a paralysis

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,799
so

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,000
so the 18f article in in the atlantic

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,919
which is from quite a long time

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
ago is i can't believe there's not more

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,320
articles about how interesting this

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,520
stuff is

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,600
um us digital response which uh

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,279
it was an organization that sort of came

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,399
out of the code for america

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,120
sort of network um

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,520
because of kovid and because of because

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,399
of

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
uh you know our racial reckoning moment

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,200
and because of

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,840
you know pandemic and quarantine um

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,760
and the unemployment all of those issues

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,520
were issues that governments across the

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,720
country were just struggling with how do

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,399
we get people checks

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
how do we deal with whether people wear

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,279
mass or not how you know how do we make

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,720
our systems

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,880
more transparent and helpful at this

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,159
moment where people are needing so much

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,399
so u.s digital response was an amazing

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,000
it stood up for for this moment still

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,880
exists now and is going to get

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,840
bigger but we're able to sort of recruit

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,279
private sector

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,360
and some other talent to be match made

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,480
with individuals to solve big problems

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
um and so

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
there's a lot of this stuff that's just

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,360
sort of

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
developing itself because no one

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,640
developed it but it's

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,480
proved its usefulness so my sense is

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
it's going to become

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,000
systematized you know and hopefully

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,679
government will have learned its lesson

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,399
and will start hiring in a different way

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,399
as well

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,000
yeah interesting yeah you're right i've

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,159
seen some really cool tour duties on

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,919
folks really making a difference and

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
yeah really appreciate your leadership

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,799
and sort of that bridge between the

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,919
public and private sectors

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,000
i mean i don't do it i just fund the

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,840
geniuses that do it and i can also say

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,880
that it was very selfish like

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,880
we needed these technologies ourselves

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
um you know you can't you can't make an

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,840
argument for

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,200
why a company is doing something

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,519
that they shouldn't be allowed to do if

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
you can not make the technical technical

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,399
arguments about

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,519
what can happen what can't happen and

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,519
for so long

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
you know people would wander around the

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,919
hill on behalf of some of these

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,720
companies and say

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
you know those advocates you know that

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
they're

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,640
you know they just don't understand that

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,080
you know we're not doing that

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,240
and they don't really understand and we

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,360
couldn't make the changes that you want

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,440
us to change

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,720
and you know it's just not true but you

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,159
actually have to put your money where

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,240
your mouth is and actually

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,679
show why it's true and to do that we

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,320
need a different kind of technologist

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,480
working

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,919
with government and civil society right

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,919
yeah and i know your website's really

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
been showcasing some of those geniuses

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,360
who are making a difference so i

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,080
encourage you all to take a look

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,679
um so because i'm in closing kind of on

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
a lighter note you know i love live

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,320
music and we're sort of fortunate in the

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,159
us

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,559
that things are opening up a little bit

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,679
so kind of my question twofold who

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,679
what's the favorite

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,519
band or musician you've played with and

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,440
who are you looking forward to hearing

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,559
live in the future so that's

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
interesting um you know one of the

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,519
benefits

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
i'm a dc girl but because of my job at

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
ford i've had to live in new york for a

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,679
long time you know some people say

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,200
had to live like it's tragedy but um but

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,320
one of the real benefits of

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
living in new york is the free concerts

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,760
in

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,080
central park uh in the summertime it's

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
just

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,440
there's nothing like it uh you know it's

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
a first come first serve to get the

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,200
tickets

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,919
and then you're outside in a beautiful

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,720
park in the middle of this enormous city

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,240
and you know anything you see there is

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
going to be joyful i remember we saw

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,399
gregory porter once

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,000
and it was like all he was so delicious

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
he was playing with an orchestra

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,279
and all these strangers were just like

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,840
buying each other ice cream

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,360
and dancing and having the most fun in

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,919
the world so something like that where

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
you can

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,960
it's not just about seeing music but the

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,440
idea that you can

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,039
enjoy it with strangers you know who you

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,559
don't know if they've been vaccinated or

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,799
not or if they're you know like you've

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,000
we've been made to feel afraid of our

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,279
call you know like think about

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,200
it we've had a year and a half of

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
crossing the street when someone

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
is walking towards you and so figuring

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,559
out how we can be next to each other and

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,960
dance with each other and

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,039
you know and meet strangers is going to

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
be some muscles that i'd like to work on

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,559
in the future

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,480
