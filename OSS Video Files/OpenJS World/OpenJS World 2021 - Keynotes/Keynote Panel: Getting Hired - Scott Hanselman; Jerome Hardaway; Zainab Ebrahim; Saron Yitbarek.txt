stories

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
i thought a better idea would be to

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
bring people who are much more

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400

so this panel wants to kind of talk

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
about getting hired decode a little bit

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
about it we're in the middle of

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
you know in the middle of a panera bread

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
in the middle of a panini

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
some people find that an offensive joke

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,200
i find it

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
funny every single time i don't care

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
whether you think it's a bad thing or

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
not

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
we are in a really difficult time right

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
now both in tech

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
we're having growing pains as a war as a

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,680
world we're

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
separated and not all in person at

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,840
openjs world right now

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960
and getting hired is really hard every

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
time i hear about someone losing their

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,560
job in the middle of this pandemic

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
i think to myself wow this is a really

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,720
rough a rough time

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,040
to be doing that zainab have have people

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
been coming to flourish for for coaching

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,600
and

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
being better at getting getting higher

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
during this time

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
yeah what you're saying is absolutely

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,079
right it is a lot harder during this

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,159
time

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
uh we've been seeing a lot of people

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
struggling

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,159
to get jobs a lot a lot more than

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,320
we had in last year um

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,680
i think things are gonna get better i'm

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
i'm feeling very hopeful

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,159
that um come this summer um and the

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
trend especially here in

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
in the us um is going like things are

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,200
going to get better but yeah

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,200
it's been a struggle and mostly it has

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,400
to do with the hesitancy

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
of a lot of companies to hire more

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
junior

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
engineers or more entry-level engineers

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,120
and like setting a bar

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
extremely high um there's like one angle

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
that i'll share

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,599
um i saw job posting and

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
actually this has happened a lot where

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,560
um

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
there's a job description for an entry

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
level position i'm asking for

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,360
five years of experience and so

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,480
it's a little it's a little rough out

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
there for sure

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
yeah saron you've dedicated a lot of

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,080
your career to help

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
people who are you know early in career

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
be successful

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
it seems like there's a bit of a haves

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
and have-nots between there's like

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
people who have 20 years experience

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
and they may have finding trouble

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
finding jobs because of ageism

00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
and people who are just getting started

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
who can't get anyone to take a chance on

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,200
them

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
yeah absolutely and i think one thing

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
that's been really encouraging in recent

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
years

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
is moving away from calling them junior

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
developers to early career developers i

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,159
think that

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
slowly we're becoming a little bit more

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,800
open-minded as to you know the different

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,720
skill levels we're willing to accept

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
in developer positions and i think just

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
starting with naming is a good sign that

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
we're moving in the right direction

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,319
i've also seen titles like associate

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
developer which is also encouraging

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,760
because it kind of

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
establishes the career ladder you know a

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
little bit sooner a little bit earlier

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
in someone's career and i find that

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
really encouraging so i think that we

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
are i think we're

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
very very far away from getting to where

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,480
we want to be but i can see kind of baby

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
steps

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,920
in incorporating and introducing people

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
with

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,640
just one or zero years of experience

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,400
into the official ladder

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,760
at a tech company and at an engineering

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,840
team

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
one of my bosses has said that when

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
you're putting together a basketball

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
team

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,640
you can't teach height but everything

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
else can be taught ball handling rules

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,840
of the game and all those kind of things

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,120
and he is consistently surprised

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
that we don't hire for height because

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
honestly you know oh you don't know ruby

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
that's fine we'll teach you ruby you

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,239
don't know c sharp will teach us c

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,760
sharp jerome you work with veterans in

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
upscaling those veterans

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
why don't people teach why don't people

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
hire like that

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,520
um i think but especially when i'm

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
sitting in the market right now i just

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
think it's

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
if i'm being 100 honest i'm thinking

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,320
it's a little bit of

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
uh trying to hitch the bets in their

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,960
favor

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,960
and you know just laziness right we

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,479
i've been on this remote journey of

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
being able to educate enough skilled

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,720
people remotely

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
for six seven years right so i

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
i have that experience a lot of people

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
especially

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,880
we're not truly doing it remote first or

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,160
doing it on

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,639
you know in a pandemic so it's not like

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
real remote work where you you know you

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
can work from home and then you like

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
you know go to the beach and then

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,639
everybody's happy and stuff it's like oh

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
you know

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
i'm gonna put on a mask and wash my

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
hands like for 45 seconds because you

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,360
know i don't want to get sick

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,360
so it's a different mindset and

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
people are just not thinking from it

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,320
like in that like in that

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
aspect when it comes to hiring and like

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,840
working with remote workers

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
i i spoke last week to our company that

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
had 200 entry-level jobs

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,880
just on backfield because you know we're

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,360
just going to wait till the world opens

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
up

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,000
when my senior software engineers so my

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
my alumni who are getting there going

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
for their second job so when they come

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
to me and they ask me

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
to like help them with it they're

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
getting hired within weeks and they're

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
getting

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
upwards to like the salary plus like 20

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,039
50 more than what they asked for i have

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
a veteran

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,759
who just came he's in he's in uh seattle

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,199
but he just got a job in nashville

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,160
he's getting paid 50 above the average

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
salary of a senior front engineer there

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
so

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
it's a real like it's a really crazy

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,400
market right now

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,759
particularly for those who are senior

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
able to get you know they're getting

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,960
snatched away hotcakes and

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,800
they're getting a lot more money than

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,199
they're asking for

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
while juniors they're having to almost

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
be like small

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,440
versions of devrel and they're having to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
really

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,759
showcase those skills to us to instill

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,680
that social equity

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,880
to you know get companies to you know

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
take a chance on that

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
yeah it feels like the uh the the bell

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,000
curve the standard bell curve is kind of

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
inverted right now and we're seeing

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,199
very very early in career and very very

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,319
senior people and everyone is having a

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,520
challenge right now getting someone to

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
take a chance on them and to your point

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
we're all remote

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
so i guess we won't hire a junior

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
achieving pardon me an early in career

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
or an emerging

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
developer because we don't have the time

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,160
the patience

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,080
perhaps we're too lazy to really invest

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
in them i can't sit with that

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,120
person and give them that love that they

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,199
need that

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
and honestly the ability to fail i think

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,280
that we don't give early and career

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
developers

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,880
a safe place to fail fast and often

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
without judgment

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,360
we call it grace in like my community

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,880
like you have to be able to give people

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,560
grace like we demand we demand a level

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
of perfection that we can't obtain

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
from a junior so that we didn't have and

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
one is particularly

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,599
when you go to like middle and city

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,680
engineers they are

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
i've seen it in my community a lot where

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
people are demanding a level of

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,639
capabilities i'm like

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,840
do you not remember how like when we

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,440
first got in this community

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,400
how easy it was to get in like all you

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,599
had to do was know bootstrap and jquery

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,880
like now is a front end you can't even

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
like you need to know a front-end

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
framework

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,759
you need to understand apis you need to

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,479
uh like be able to tell the difference

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,479
between

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
several for running css frameworks from

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
bootstrap to foundation

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
tailwind it's not the same so we have to

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
give people grace

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,800
if i may that's an excellent segue let

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,520
me ask you this zainab uh

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,759
that list of skills that jerome just

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,599
rattled off which is large

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
what do early and career developers feel

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
when they see that like this is the

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,039
stack you need to make a web page

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
yeah it's pretty overwhelming i think

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,400
what we've been seeing a lot

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
with the people that we've been talking

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,879
about is like a lot of anxiety

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,680
and feeling like um they're not good

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
enough

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
right and i find that that mentality

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
sometimes even hinders their ability to

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
really get through the interview process

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
right because when you're going the

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
interview process in itself is already

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
extremely hard right

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,319
you're like put on the spot you have to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,000
talk to people it's really anxiety

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,719
inducing in itself but then

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,080
if on top of that you feel like you know

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
there's so much to learn

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
there's so much to know and i'm expected

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
to know all of these things

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,399
all at once in order to prove myself in

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,279
order to

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,279
get this job that i really want and i

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,120
like to reframe that a little bit

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,320
in the sense that if you can code

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
you can learn and this industry it's all

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
about learning

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
nobody is perfect nobody knows it all

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
right like i've been in the industry for

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
10 years almost 10 years and there are

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
so many things that i don't know and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
it's like

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
more about being comfortable with the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
idea that you will not know

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,959
but that you can convince someone and

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,440
and first of all convince yourself

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,040
that you can pick up any framework that

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,920
comes around you know i mean like

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
you can learn and that is the type of

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,720
stuff that

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,240
uh gets you hired right being able to

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
demonstrate that you can

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,279
you're resourceful that you can learn

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
that you're driven

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,040
and i think that um that's that's the

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,200
focus that we should be

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,959
having really because the amount of

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
frameworks and technologies and tools

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
that are going to come up

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
are going to continue to grow right and

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
that should not be the focus

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
um if you can code you can pretty much

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,800
pick up

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,640
um any of those things along the way

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
so ron in your career you have been very

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
much as someone who empowers and wants

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
people to

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,320
think about the system as opposed to

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,880
thinking about the individual line of

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
code

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
is that important what zainab is saying

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
to like learn how to learn is the most

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
important skill that people have to have

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,680
right now in today's job market

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,959
i think so i think the other thing is to

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,360
learn how to focus

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,519
um i spent a lot of time talking to all

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,959
kinds of strangers all over the world

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
and just you know offering my two cents

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
and trying to be helpful

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,079
and giving feedback and perspective on

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
their you know job hunts and their learn

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,240
to code journeys

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
and one of the things that shows up over

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,680
and over again

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
is just people just bouncing around

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
being all over the place

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,040
and their inability to you know to lower

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
their

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,480
inability but their struggle to learn um

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
isn't because they

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,160
literally can't learn it's because they

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
feel as as he said

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,480
overwhelmed and they feel all over the

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,760
place and they feel like oh

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
you know i hear about this new framework

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,640
okay let me jump to this real quick oh

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
two weeks pass oh no there's another

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
frame okay let me go to this

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,920
and they're jumping around so much and

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
so frequently that they get nothing done

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
and then feeling like they get nothing

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,519
done

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
makes them feel stupid and that they

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
can't learn and then this is vicious

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
cycle

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
so i feel like you know it's not just

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
learning how to learn but learning how

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,320
um as jerome just put in the chat

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,800
learning how to plan and learning how to

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,200
stick to a plan and believe in the plan

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
um kind of trusting the process i think

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
is something that is

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
understandably very very difficult for

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,279
something that's as hard as cutting

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
but i think that's a really big problem

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,240
that i've seen i really like um

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
what i'm seeing in uh in social media

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
with with younger people and i mean

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
literally younger in age

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
using technology in a way that is

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
creative so that they can have

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
accountability partners there's a young

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,120
woman on tick tock name

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
medical cat with a k she streams herself

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,079
studying

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
so that others might normalize studying

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
for three or four hours at a time so she

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
puts her phone there

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
and she studies she plays music she does

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
pomodoros

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
and then every 25 minutes she takes a

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
break and she addresses the live

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,760
audience and it's mostly just

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,120
chill and vibe and learn with cat and i

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
think to myself like

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
wow i would never have that ability to

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
to be that organized to be that

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
disciplined to be that plan but

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
what's cool about it that you're

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,519
watching her um

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
be dedicated to a thing and it's like

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
well if if this

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639
internet stranger is being open and

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,600
positive and empowering then

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,600
maybe i'll plan my study and we'll we'll

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
do it together we'll study together

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,120
and uh having those those those

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
partnerships as opposed traditional

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
mentorships which is just old person

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,200
lectures young person i think is

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
uh is a new way to think about studying

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
and planning

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,320
especially in public um jerome now you

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
have put together

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,720
vets who code for many years now and uh

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,200
it's not necessarily a

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
mentorship program there's a lot of peer

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
you know people

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
mentoring each other kind of work as

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,079
well how do you make sure that it's not

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,279
just

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,920
you hold court uh you know

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,519
regularly and tell them what you know uh

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,480
how do i make sure um

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,480
well just

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,240
how do i best pay the best way to say

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,639
this i feel like i have a

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
unfair disadvantage in the education

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
place right

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,160
i am my people right the people that

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
come through vetsuko

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,639
they're usually people who you know they

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
were on the front lines and battlefields

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
and stuff

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
and that's who i was so in the military

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
they would call us like first term

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,399
troops like uh the e4 mafia

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
so the lower ranking people and i'm one

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,040
of them

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,399
so it's like i know where they come from

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
so i'm a part of the gang

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
and i'm able to talk to them in their

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,320
language

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
and be able to come from a fire team

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,760
format of like yo

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
we this is how we're going to do this

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,839
like all right

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,920
language yes exactly right i can come in

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
talking to them the way they've already

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,839
been trained

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,279
and it just just resonates right and

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
they understand because

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,480
from my background i have you know in

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
i have enough experience to where most

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
of the most guys and girls who are in

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,880
infantry or like

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,560
aaron who uh she was an eod

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
and always just explosive ordnance

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,199
disposal because she didn't want to jump

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,760
out of planes

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
so she chose bombs over planes to swap

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
me

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
what i'm hearing you though is that what

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,639
you're saying is because you are

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,600
a time-shifted version of them you're

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,600
them

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
in the future yes prove that it's

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,399
possible and then they can

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
run in the direction that you're running

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
and i think that's the biggest like

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
yeah i think that's the biggest secret

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,079
like you know i'm i think i'm the only

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,959
code school guy that's not like you know

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,160
i don't have

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,720
fancy bastards or anything like that i'm

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,680
just

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
hey yo i was out there i switched to m4

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
for

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,680
a macbook pro and i never looked back

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
just like y'all so

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,360
you know if i could do it you can do it

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
and then let me you know let me put you

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
guys in a team

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
and then we're going to work together in

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,079
a team and we're going to hurry up and

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
assess each other's

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,040
uh strengths and weaknesses and then

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
based on your strengths and we consist

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
we can bring in other mentors and based

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,600
upon the things that you

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,440
love and enjoy i'm going to bring in

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,320
people that can talk to you

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,199
and just keep that type of um communal

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
ecosystem

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,240
in right so i like you know we have

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
people who are

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
love css and love ux we have people who

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
love just you know doing

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,360
api serverless and i try to you know

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,639
see i try to quickly identify it's

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
almost like of you know

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,760
the 360 of a battlefield i'm always

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
trying to um

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
perpendicularly through like cyclically

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,880
in a cycler manner

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
uh identify what they

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,560
love and what they're having problems

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
with and try to like fill the gaps of

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,639
those

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,480
so that's like i said i have

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
i i have unfair advantage because i

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
think move and communicate

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
like them right so yeah and a lot of

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
places don't have that

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,240
so let me ask this then zainab how

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
important is it that people who are into

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,199
tech

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
and beginning see people who are their

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,600
people

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,759
because jerome has just described a

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
really welcoming environment that

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,120
you know and i'll be honest with you

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,800
doesn't speak to me right because i

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,120
never served and thank you for your

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
service but i'm hearing that that's what

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
they need how important is it saying

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
that for people to see people that look

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,079
like them

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:58,240
in i tech

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:01,680
you may be muted my bad yep

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,480
um it's absolutely important um i think

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
the idea of belonging goes such a long

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
way

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,079
right because this industry

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
and just coding in general is seen as

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,320
something that's very hard that takes a

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,320
lot of focus it takes a lot of energy

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
and sometimes we struggle with a lot of

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,279
imposter syndrome right like knowing

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,320
that someone like me can do it is such a

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,199
huge boost

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
right um specifically because of that

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,320
anxiety that comes

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
with you know doing something that's

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,240
really hard

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,639
um i kind of you know share in like an

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,160
example when i got started

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,360
to learn how to code it was extremely um

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,399
intimidating because i was the only

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,199
woman and woman of color in my classes

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
right i did not see any people like me

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,279
that had my interest

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,040
in the industry either and so i you know

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,240
tiptoed around it and i had a lot of

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,639
mental blocks

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,759
and i think that a lot of times it has

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,360
to do with that

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,040
um mental block that doesn't allow us to

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,319
like either do well in the interview

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,360
process or

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,360
that doesn't allow us to like get our um

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,799
energy and focus to start a project

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,919
because i remember when i was early on

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,919
in my career

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,360
i would hear a lot of advice about like

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,679
oh you need to build

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
you know build some um projects on the

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,839
side and that's going to boost your

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
resume

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,000
or you should be studying two hours a

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,319
day and i couldn't do it

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
i struggled so much with it because i

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,640
just felt like i was

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
i i just didn't have the capacity right

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
and

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
it wasn't until i started feeling more

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,919
comfortable in my skin

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
that those things started to come so

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,440
easily and so a lot

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
of of the belonging is so important

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
because it gives you a safe

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
place to start and so i think that's why

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
representation is so important because

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
it gives you a safety pad like

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
oh this person did it then maybe i can

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
do it too

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
right and you don't have to feel that

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,880
anxiety that you have to always

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,440
um be performing or um you have to

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
convince yourself and others that you

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
belong in this place

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,559
that statement that you made that uh

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
that someone says well you know she did

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,960
it i can do it and if i see that person

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,120
i can do it

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,880
i don't want me doing it to make someone

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
feel like they explicitly can't

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,559
like for example when i go to family get

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
togethers i'm the computer person

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
and there's something about me or my

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
style or whatever because i want more of

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
a classic nerd thing with the star wars

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
and the whatnot and the leds and the

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,280
video games

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,960
they go oh he's a computer person you

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
know he's a computer person

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,799
like very early we get split into

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,200
computer people and not computer people

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,520
and

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,880
i don't like that i want to normalize

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,919
normal people

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
coding and whenever someone you know i

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
say i'm a computer person and then that

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
immediately

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
frames our relationship such that they

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,480
go and flip the

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
i'm not a techie but but you are you use

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
excel and you do great things with word

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
and you

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
you know do macros in photoshop like

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
maybe you're more technical than you

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
give yourself credit for

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,520
you know what can we do in the community

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,799
to be more welcoming to those people

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
jerome you look like you have something

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,919
you want to add yeah

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,600
i've been thinking about that a lot my

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,320
solution to this is normalizing

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
people bringing their entire self to

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
work

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,880
and not just when it like benefits the

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,960
company

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
all right we've had a lot special past

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,559
two years being a minority we've had a

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
lot of conversations around black lives

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,200
matter

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,799
and being able to bring your whole self

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,799
to work but

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,799
as you've been seeing of course the past

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
year companies have started to take

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
their back because

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
it's a lot harder than you know throwing

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
a black square on instagram or a black

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
band banner

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,039
so the first thing that we have to do is

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,960
just allow people to be their whole self

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,880
like you know if you see me on twitter

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,440
twice a day i'm talking about cooking

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,559
recipes right because that's what i like

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
to think about

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,120
when uh that that helps me get my brain

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
working better than thinking about code

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
right

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
but you know oh i wonder how caviar

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
fried rice would go and you get people

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,760
like saying like stay in your lane

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
jerome i came here for the tech i don't

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
want to hear about your recipes well i

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
think

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,120
that's like i said i'm it's very hard

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
because of my background

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,200
no one really tries to gatekeep me

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,120
because they're like yo this dude

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,520
has a purple heart who am i gonna like

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,559
tell this dude what he can and can't do

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,000
so uh it's very

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,159
it's very weird right so but i think

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
as a community we just gotta let people

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,240
bring their whole sales to work like i

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,240
love going on twitter and finding all

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,679
the other random things out about people

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,200
like i you know air fryer nation right

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,600
with angie right that's

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
amazing like all these people and of

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
course angie

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,120
is a very famous uh developer and uh

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,120
tester and international speaker

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,480
who also has a cult of people who love

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,159
air frying

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,280
and they've even made t-shirts right and

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
that's a really great example though

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,720
that we as a community need to be

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
welcoming to people and all of their

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
diverse

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
diverse interests i know saron that when

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,919
you founded code newbies that was really

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,039
really important to make it so everyone

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,000
could be

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
interested in all the things that

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
they're interested in you are

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,400
normalizing normal people coding

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
yeah exactly and jerome i totally love

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
your point about

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,600
seeing uh different people and bringing

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,440
them their whole selves one of my

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,000
favorite people to follow on instagram

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
is april camera her last name right now

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
um but she's vogue and code on the

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,640
internet

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,559
she works for microsoft and she uh i

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
just love her instagram because

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,799
she's uh i think she's a developer

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,360
relations uh person i think

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,840
she does virtual reality now yeah yeah

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,120
exactly and she's talking about

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,880
her um you know her plants and her

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,039
fashion that she she sews her own

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,240
how she you know organizes her office

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
and i think she just moved to a new

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,880
house and it's just so much fun seeing

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
someone who's

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,240
highly technical written books about

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,799
python you know does so many

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
great you know hardcore quote-unquote

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
code things

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,320
being just a normal person and for us at

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
code newbie for us where that really

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
uh we've tried to kind of emphasize that

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
is

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,960
in the podcast we have a show called the

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
code movie podcast we've done hundreds

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
of episodes over the last

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,200
six seven years now and when we pick

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,799
the yes when we pick who we want to

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,679
showcase on the show

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,880
we go for people who are normal people

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
who represent

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
all different walks of life all

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
different backgrounds people who started

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
as

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,480
babysitters and teachers and you know

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,320
one of our most popular episodes was the

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,559
truck driver who learned how to

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,679
how to code you know in between um you

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,679
know driving trucks and

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,360
on little breaks and late at night and

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,320
just saying that you know normal people

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,159
people with

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,760
regular jobs with you know maybe a

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
little bit more humble beginnings

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
can get started and by showcasing such a

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,000
wide range of people

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,640
you know a nice array of people you're

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,559
able to send home the message that hey

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,320
there is an archetype there is no one

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,280
right way to do it there is no single

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
path

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,760
everyone is different and this place is

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
welcoming to all so for us it's been

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
storytelling that's been our primary

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,360
tool

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,960
that's great doesn't it seem like that

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
that open source and linux and

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,080
javascript and open code

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
is really like should be the place where

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
people go

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,000
to get involved in tech like it is on

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,480
the open source community to be like hey

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
like the whole point of all of this was

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,039
free code and

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
free you know free knowledge and all

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,559
these kinds of things this should be the

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,679
community that people go to

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,360
uh to uh to get involved in technology

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,600
saying that when you are coaching people

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,039
to be uh to you know to go and get jobs

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,520
to go and do interviews and things like

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
that

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
uh does open source matter on their

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,919
resumes

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,320
100 i actually think that that is a

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,679
great opportunity to showcase your

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,360
um your skills but also your drive

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,200
right it shows that that you care about

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,080
someone else's project or that you care

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
about a community

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,720
and to build it and it is a huge booster

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
in someone's resume especially if you're

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
just getting started with your career so

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,039
that is definitely somewhere

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
that i try to like point people towards

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
but i

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,279
will say that a lot of people kind of

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,960
feel intimidated by that as well

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,400
you know and i think it has to do with

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
the fact that we

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
are probably scared of like making

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,000
mistakes

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,440
right like if i open a pull request on

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,760
some you know

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,559
open source project what if i get you

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
know

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,640
rejected what if uh someone you know is

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
criticizing the way that i'm approaching

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480
this and so

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,279
i think there's definitely a need for

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,440
creating

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
a little bit more of an incentive for

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,799
people to feel okay with like you don't

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,720
have to get everything right you know

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,080
you don't have to get everything perfect

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,520
and it's about the intention and um just

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
getting ourselves out there

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,960
uh yeah that's a call back a little bit

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
to that car

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
that statement that i made a little bit

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,600
ago where i said people need a welcoming

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
place to fail that's the number one

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,279
thing at microsoft where i work that we

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,279
feel that the early and career people

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,279
say that they don't feel comfortable

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,880
failing because they think they have to

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
be perfect they were perfect their whole

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,919
lives to get to this place

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,760
and now they're at this big scary

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,559
company and they need to do just the

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,919
right thing

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,159
and i would really like them to be able

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,000
to fail quickly you know hopefully

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
without costing billions of dollars

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
uh as fast as possible and they always

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
like how do you know this god how do you

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
know this obscure thing well

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,000
many years ago when i failed very very

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,159
quickly i

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,640
learned this thing the semicolon that

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,720
just spent six hours debugging

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,159
and now you two know this stuff like

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,600
that's how we get this these stories

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,600
right of stories of failure

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,200
that's my favorite thing like um they

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
just put me in a project at microsoft

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,720
and i was like oh i'm gonna mess this up

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
i'll let y'all know that right now

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,039
and everybody was like well at least you

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,360
run it so i was like yeah i'm a

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,640
you know you have to like i said with

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,880
the whole idea of grace

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,679
like but it starts with yourself right

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,240
people they get in their own heads right

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
and they are trying to live up to an

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
unrealistic viewpoint of themselves i'm

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
like

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,000
you know i try to i tell my veterans

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
that all the time i'm like

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
did you forget how crazy it was going

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
through basic

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,720
you were not you before you were in a

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,440
basic

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,080
you were to the military a horrible

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,559
version

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,000
of civilian that had to get molded into

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,279
who you currently are now

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,039
so don't think about it in that

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,799
in the scope that you have to be perfect

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,640
i was like no they literally

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,159
trained you and taught you how to do

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,559
things that's how it's going to be

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,840
now we apply that to a community like

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,960
one thing that i love the best that i

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,200
learned from the military

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
is you know i call it you know two

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,679
things crawl walk run

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,600
and buddy system so when i when i'm in

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,760
open source and i'm helping my veterans

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
it's always first thing i do is i

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
connect them to someone who has more

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,880
experience in this than them

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
and i try to make projects that can help

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,279
them uh grow

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,400
in open source as well as you know not

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,799
intimidate them

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
i've i've learned a lot about onboarding

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,600
open source

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,559
over the past six years because of you

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
know i

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,440
you know i've seen it all the bad things

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,559
i've seen all the good things so i'm

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,320
like you know what

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,600
you know these are things that you need

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
to you need to find

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,120
when you're going to open source like

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
community just find

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,120
a first find something that you actually

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,440
enjoy and then turn around and see

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,240
you know where can i help and just start

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
talking to people

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,840
you'll be amazed how much you know

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,720
you'll learn just doing that a lot of

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,320
people don't think

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,799
about that you know what coding is a

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,600
social game and you have to get in there

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
and start thinking and aspects of these

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,039
are people

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,480
behind code right companies they don't

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,840
think like that for the most part but

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,200
you know when it comes to open source

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,080
you can do that particularly in

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,559
javascript where you know because of you

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,919
know

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,240
react and the va engine we kind of

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
democratized coding because we went from

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,679
the

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,760
toy language and like flipped into like

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,679
oh this is one of the fastest growing

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,200
production level languages on the planet

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,080
like how did that happen right this was

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,799
something made in

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
two weeks how on earth like who wrote

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,840
like who would have said

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,279
that this is gonna be a thing like not

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,320
the light we deserve but it is the

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,480
language that we have

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,679
yeah like who had this remaining card so

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,000
like you know and that's the idea that

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,600
you have to have right i appreciate that

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
uh sorry please in the remaining two

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,159
minutes if we could have

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
zainab maybe you could offer your last

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,919
minute uh as we head out

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,360
i almost feel like i'm just gonna open a

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
whole different tangent but i just want

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,240
to point out that

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
we've been talking about being able to

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
fail and and

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,720
not necessarily not needing to be

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,679
perfect right and being okay with not

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,679
being perfect

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,279
and i feel like there's a huge failure

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
in how we evaluate

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,640
technical uh skills in the interview

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,039
process

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,320
right the technical interview process

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,360
does not allow for

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,960
any margin of error right and so

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,279
here we are talking about what it takes

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,039
to be a good developer

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,960
and it's all about you know embracing

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,200
those failures and learning

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,240
yet for some for some reason we've

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,080
standardized

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,840
an interview process and a technical

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,600
assessment that does not allow for that

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,240
it does not allow for

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,559
people to show their true colors to be

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,880
able to bring their whole self to show

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,399
of other skills you know and to show

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,799
that they actually can learn and that

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,720
they can

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,120
actually build on previous knowledge

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,440
right and so i think that that's a huge

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,159
um thing that as a tech industry we

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,159
still

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,919
need to get right and it's like the

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
interview process itself how we

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,559
interview for tech chat

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,919
for tech um for tech skills so ron any

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,000
parting thoughts as we head out to the

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,799
end of our half an hour

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,600
um sure i think that you know my parting

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,760
thoughts are

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,640
that uh even though we have a long way

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
to go

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,679
in terms of where we are in the tech

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,919
industry and being more inclusive

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,200
and being uh kinder and just a better

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,559
place to work i think we're definitely

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
headed in the right direction i've been

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,360
really optimistic

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,520
especially in the last couple years of

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,200
seeing as i mentioned the early career

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,679
developer you know name change this idea

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,799
of you know pushing back against burnout

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
and really embracing

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,120
self-care and mental health and i feel

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,440
like we are getting to a place where we

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,799
are

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,039
including more people and we are

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,799
bringing people in and that

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,720
is because of individuals it's because

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,440
of individual people who

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,440
decided to be kind decided to be open

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,080
decided to be welcoming so i hope

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,039
i hope each of you feel empowered to to

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
take on a little bit of that

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,240
responsibility

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,279
and making coding a better place to be

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,480
fantastic

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,559
