howdy folks and welcome to how open

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,839
governance influences

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,600
open source and inner source at godaddy

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,000
my colleague jonathan and i today will

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,440
be talking about this subject

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
for those of you who don't know me all

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,000
that well i've been doing node for

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
over a decade now and i've written many

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,359
many open source libraries that you've

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
probably written

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,960
in another life i was the founder and

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
ceo of a company called nojitsu

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
and we were acquired by godaddy in 2015

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
which is the beginning of our story

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
which i'll talk about in just a minute

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
during that time at godaddy i have been

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,360
the founding board member of the node.js

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,440
foundation

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
and most recently founding board member

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
of the openjs foundation

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,680
both at the gold tier now as i mentioned

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,280
no jitsu was acquired by godaddy in 2015

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,039
and one of the things that really became

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
poignant to me during that time

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
was something referred to as conway's

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,760
law i won't spell it out for you here

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
but it basically means that

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
software system will start to resemble

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,399
the organization that

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,280
it is created within or as drucker puts

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,400
it

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,240
culture eats strategy for breakfast

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
so without going into too many details

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
as i've talked about uh

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
building software elsewhere in other

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
talks we're going to talk a bit today

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
about

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,600
how open governance works for our

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
internal

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
groups such as our open source working

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
group

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
now this was created very shortly after

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
i joined godaddy

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,080
and one of the things that was really

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,759
poignant about it was that we wanted to

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,520
push decisions to the engineers

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,640
the subject matter experts as a voice to

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,000
sending content into a black hole or to

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
get approval from some

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,240
set of approvers that you may or may not

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
know we actually have a simple release

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
process

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
that allows for a set of reviewers that

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,759
is all engineers

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
to decide whether or not something is

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
fit for release obviously there are

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,280
trademark and other

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
implications that need to be reviewed by

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
our legal team as necessary

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
but it's really been a very successful

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
group

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,799
internally the company now this went on

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,000
for a few

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
years before something else started to

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
emerge

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
and that is emerging open governance

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
more broadly

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
specifically what started to be clear is

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
that the volunteers

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
because this is funded as an employee

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
research resource group as my colleague

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,239
jonathan will talk about

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,319
shortly was that once they became

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
motivated they stayed motivated because

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
they understood the mission of the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
working group that they

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,160
operated in and wanted to keep going and

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
go

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,480
deeper now right around a few years ago

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,760
we had an engineering blog turnover

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
prior to that our engineering blog had

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,319
been managed by a single person

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
with a single approver which took quite

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,840
a bit of time because

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
as a large engineering population

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
writing content

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
having a single review was simply not

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
enough we had a few employees who wanted

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
to

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,280
organize the engineering blog themselves

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,599
and so this emergent open governance

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
became true open governance

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,640
i.e the flattening of a pyramid

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,440
structure

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
with this single approver into a graph

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,959
or a network

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
pushing the decisions down just as we

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,760
did with

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,319
open source now the real key here is

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
direct

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
action and really it's this essential

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,800
thing that says

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
you're not going to wait for someone

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
else to do it for you you're simply

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
going to do it

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,519
obviously if you read a bit more about

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
direct

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
action you'll see it come up in some

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,319
anarchy literature but

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
it is very poignant here

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,200
and to talk a little bit more about

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
where we went with this i'll hand it

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
over to my colleague

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
jonathan thanks charlie as our internal

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,959
and external community engagement grew

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,680
so did our need for structure and

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,080
governance so we created gd open

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
gdopen is godaddy's nexus of technology

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,040
and community

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,480
it provides a model for open and formal

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
governance that's extensible and

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
repeatable

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
and it's fostered and supported by

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,560
leadership structurally gd open is

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
fairly simple

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
there's a top-level steering committee

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
that handles chartering working groups

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
spinning down old ones and supporting

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
programs across them but the real work

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
happens inside those working groups

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
which are focused on driving one or more

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,040
business

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,359
and or community needs gd open was

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
modeled after the node.js working group

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,800
working groups go through a lightweight

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,560
charter process to align on purpose and

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
processes and agree on a set of metrics

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,520
to target

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
starting a working group is easy we

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
provide a github template that includes

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
a base charter and metrics

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
statement as well as process docs to

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
help keep things consistent between the

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
working groups

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,479
we require at least three members to

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
form a working group to make sure

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
there's enough massive interest in the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
space

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
membership is documented in the working

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
group repo so joining is just a pull

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
request away

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,759
since gd open is managed as an employee

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
resource group these working groups fit

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
into existing funding models and have

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
access to corporate resources as needed

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
so let's get to what working groups are

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
working groups are bodies meant to drive

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
business outcomes or policies around

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
internal and external technical

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
communities they're often formed across

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
disciplines

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,720
for example our engineering blog working

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
group brings together engineering

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,160
pm public relations and even recruiting

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
they range across a mix of technical and

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
non-technical areas

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
charlie touched on the history of the

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
open source and blog working groups but

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
i'd like to tell you about another one

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
a couple of years ago i helped co-found

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
the interviews working group to help

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
concentrate efforts to hone our

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
engineering interview process

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,120
to try to make it more of a delight for

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
candidates and

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
the interviewers driving this process

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
through gd open

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
gave us visibility into other parts of

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
the company working towards the same

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
goals in fact our head of recruiting is

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
a member of this working group today

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
now i want to dig in a step further and

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
talk about guilds

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,960
inspired by spotify's model guilds are

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,919
groups of people who rally around a

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,759
technical topic

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
be it a programming language technology

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,400
or tool

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
they're for sharing best practices

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
discussing new developments and

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,759
fostering a community of practice

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
but we're also careful to define what

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
they're not guilds are not for tackling

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
business goals setting standards or

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
managing infrastructure

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
there are communities for folks to come

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
together to learn share and grow

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
on the left is the initial set of gills

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
that were formed

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,440
over time the list grew new languages

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
new technologies new communities

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
because the bootstrapping process is so

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,160
lightweight folks felt empowered to

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
start up a guild whenever there was

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,759
common interest

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
guilds made a home for tech talks demos

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,360
and collaboration

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
guilds have kept forming some starting

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
as just a slack channel and eventually

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,479
becoming more formal

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,400
while the early guilds were primarily

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,080
made of engineers some newer ones are

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
being formed across disciplines

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
for example product managers across

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
teams came together to form the

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,240
navigation guild

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,680
to share best practices and new

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
developments in wayfinding and

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
information architecture

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
the desire for community was always

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,479
there the guild model simply provided

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,400
the scaffold for these communities to

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,319
flourish

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,639
gd open also serves to manage our

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
external technical community engagement

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
this includes participating in standards

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
track organizations trade groups and

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,080
external open source

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
for example godaddy is a member of ecma

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,360
and participates in tc39

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
the committee that specifies the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
javascript language

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
engineers at godaddy have championed

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,120
proposals such as es modules

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
optional chaining and null coalescing

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,880
and we informally participate in other

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
standards track bodies such as what wg

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
and w3c

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
we also participate in various trade

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
groups and foundations including the

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,280
openjs foundation

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,880
domain name association and we are

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
founding members of the node.js

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
foundation

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,400
gd open helps us coordinate these

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
investments across the company

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
godaddy is a big believer in the open

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
source model we frequently release

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
projects to open source

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,280
here are just a few all of this is

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
managed through the gd open open source

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
working group

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
the code review process license and

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,039
documentation standards and the

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
nitty-gritty logistics of posting code

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
to github

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
and by managing this process in gd open

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
it sits close to other relevant working

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,759
groups such as our engineering blog

00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,039
group

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
so we can announce these releases

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,759
broadly godaddy engineers also

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
contribute frequently to existing open

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
source projects

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
here are some of the larger

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
contributions over the last few years

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
our open source working group manages

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
the processes to contribute code

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,240
externally and ensures that folks feel

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,919
empowered to pitch into the community

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
we've shared a lot about our models so

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
far but this is a hard problem

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,039
we don't have all the answers we've got

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
some ideas to keep growing like

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
sponsoring open source projects both at

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,759
a company and

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
individual level and formalizing a

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
process for engineers to safari onto

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
open source projects

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,800
i hope this top gives you some ideas on

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
how to bring open governance and

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,839
structure to the technical communities

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
in your organization

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,919
we'd love to hear your ideas too reach

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,200
out on twitter to start the conversation

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,200
