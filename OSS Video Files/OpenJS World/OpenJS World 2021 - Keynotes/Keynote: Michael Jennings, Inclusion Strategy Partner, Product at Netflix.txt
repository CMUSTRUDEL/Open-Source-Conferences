serve as an inclusion strategy partner

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,080

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,639
product at netflix i'll be honest with

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,599
you

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,160
i never knew how connected the world was

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
until i began to work at netflix

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
an early morning meeting with my

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,119
colleagues from different countries on

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
the african continent

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,279
a lunch chat with a leader in new york

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
meetings with my team in los

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,160
angeles and ending the day with the

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,600
spirited debate with my buddy aikido

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,559
in tokyo inclusion and diversity is an

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,600
essential part of each of our businesses

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,000
the products software infrastructure and

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,680
futuristic innovations we make

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,160
impact a vast variety of people

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
and now more than ever customers are

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,920
holding organizations responsible for

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,079
their inclusion footprint

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
we all know inclusion is good for

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,039
business but

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
i'll take it a step further and say that

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,800
inclusion is a value that is conducive

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,360
to business

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,360
members of our organizations both small

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
and big are not just workers but

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,439
human extensions of the places they work

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,280
which means the spaces

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,759
organizations create are marketed

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,000
unintentionally and

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
intentionally by the folks that work

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
there so

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
it's important that we create spaces

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
that are

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
inclusive psychologically safe and

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
reduce boundary

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
and reduce the boundaries of the world

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
the greatest

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,360
innovations we can make is the

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,400
empowerment of

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,400
people the people power the ideas

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
the people make the organizations come

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
alive the people at your organizations

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,000
are what connect people

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,759
like me who have no idea what you talk

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,119
about at this conference

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
to the technology that i use you're my

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,560
bridge

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,320
so i ask questions like how diverse is

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
your staff

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
what countries are you targeting what

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,920
does inclusion really mean to you

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,159
and can your automated technology say my

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280
sister's name right because

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,560
most don't when you say there's

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,280
homogeneity in your field i ask

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
what are you doing about it because it's

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
important for me

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
as a user of the technology or somebody

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
who is

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
marketing the technology to see myself

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,160
embedded

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,120
in the technology now

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
my job is included so i'm paid to talk

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
about this stuff

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,160
but i also see the best

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
and worst parts of the workplace every

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,879
day

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,959
i'm even faced with the challenges of my

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,720
own biases

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
the challenges of the things that i've

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
been taught

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,480
i'm reminded of all of my flaws

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
but in this work i've grown a greater

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
appreciation for

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,080
the humanness and the dignity of people

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
the most rewarding thing is seeing

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,080
people recognize that maybe there are

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,360
some biases in their processes or maybe

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,000
they are looking at the bar from a a

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,400
really weird perspective

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,879
looking at people and them realizing

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,319
that systems do

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,959
and at times exclude people

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
i've learned that inclusion is what is

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
often missing in conflict or

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,239
when we make societal mistakes is

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
business

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
look inclusion is hard imagine having to

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
tell

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
engineers and scientists that there

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,280
really isn't a fix

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:46,000
it's just a journey the look that most

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:49,280
of y'all give me could shrink a mountain

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,080
so what really is conclusion

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
i see inclusion as a complex piece of

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
art that

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,159
looks different through different lenses

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
i've realized that it's not necessarily

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,040
the art

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,360
is the conversation about the

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,959
perspectives of what is being

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,680
seen and what's the problem that the art

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,760
is solving for or displaying in the

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,120
world

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,639
so the question is what's the problem

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
you are solving for

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,639
and do you have the eyes in the ears

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,160
that you need to solve it

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:30,000
then ask yourself what's over

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,320
represented on my team or in my group

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
and don't just focus on the visible it's

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,960
not a check mark exercise but

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
an opportunity for you to ask how can we

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
create

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,759
space for minds that are different

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
i want you to think about experience

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
demeanor

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,479
voice thinking style cultural origins

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
education

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,440
and background then ask yourself how can

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,800
these different identities

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,680
in experience elevate this work

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
i tend to think of hiring or moving

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,919
people into a

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,560
your team as puzzle work

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,160
it's easy to find all the corners but

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
it's even harder to

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
signal in on some of the identities and

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,400
experiences that you need to

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,400
elevate your projects or your products

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,600
i want you to be innovative

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,759
in the work that you do not just around

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,800
technology

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
but around the people

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,440
now this is where it gets hard

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,880
i want you to think about you who are

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,039
you comfortable with

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,400
what makes a good partner what makes

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
them good at their job

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,880
what does talent density mean now and

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
what will it mean the same thing in the

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
future

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
who do you dislike

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
who do you not like to be around on your

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
team and when someone is different at

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
the table

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,120
what do your instincts stay now

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,840
ask yourself why questioning the actions

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,199
the questions and perceptions we have

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
helps us understand

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
us metacognition is the basis for our

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
inclusion journey

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
no matter where you are oftentimes we

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
rush into

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,360
interpersonal and organizational work so

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
fast that we don't uncover the biases

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
that we

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,600
possess at the individual level and if

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
we don't do that then how can we create

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
space

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
for each other it's hard to look in the

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
mirror

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,360
but each one of us has a unique identity

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,639
and experiences that carry bias with

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
them

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,639
understand my shock when a former

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,600
principal called me out for having a

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:48,240
bias against my black male students

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,120
not true i responded i'm a black male

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,639
then that moment happened and i realized

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,479
what she called me out on

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,400
was true it hit me hard but

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,000
through lots of conversation with her

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
and thinking about my past

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
i found that it was rooted in my parents

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,039
divorce

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,840
and my desire to protect my mother

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,840
was now being played out in my classroom

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
as much as many of us would prefer to

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,199
keep the personal

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,560
in the professional separated it's

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
difficult because our

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,319
workspaces are microcosm of the world so

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
that means we bring

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
stuff to work it means that i bring the

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,680
fears of being a mod arboree to work

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,599
it means that my wife has to take a deep

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,960
breath when she's the only

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
in a room it means that my work is

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,639
important to me

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,280
and i hope that you see me because i

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
will make

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,560
every attempt to see you we may not

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,840
understand or agree

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,360
but we can respect each other's dignity

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,120
in humanity i depend on organizations

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
like yours to be my bridge to the

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,759
technology we use

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,680
so i ask the question what is your

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,199
inclusion blueprint

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,319
don't just be innovative with the

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,479
technology be innovative with the people

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,960
the processes the space in the business

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,319
i think of inclusion as a pyramid at the

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,319
base

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
is the individual work then the

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,919
interpersonal work

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
then the organizational and the last is

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,400
the community or world work

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,919
each piece is essential and probably can

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
be done by themselves

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
but when you stack them up they reach

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
higher so i encourage

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
anybody who has talk of being inclusive

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
or

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,599
wanting to engage more in inclusion to

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
do self-work

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
so here are five things that i think is

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
conducive

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,600
to doing self work number one

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,240
reflection inclusion is reflection

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
in so many ways asking yourself about

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,399
your processes

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
where was communication getting feedback

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,640
from other

00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:00,560
folks understanding where bias may lay

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,880
the second is exploring your own bias

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
now i think the harvard implicit bias

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,160
test is

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
pretty good but there are a lot of

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
things that i

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
encourage folks to do why do you live in

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
the place

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
that you live why do you shop at the

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
stores you shop at why is your

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
friendship group the way that they are

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,160
why would you prefer your kids to hang

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,120
around this person versus

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
this person asking yourself questions

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
about

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
why you have a visceral reaction to

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
certain things helps with you

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,680
exploring what your biases are and then

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,320
thinking about how they translate into

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,640
the work

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,160
space the next is why is inclusion

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,440
important to you

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,279
figure out your why is vitally important

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
because organizations say it's important

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,040
to them but it's important for the

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,640
organizational members

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,000
to say why it's important for them

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
and they don't want you to aim for

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,320
excellence not perfection

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
because imperfections sometimes we get

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
froze when we want to

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,120
ask a question or say something

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,320
but with excellence we're exploring the

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,279
opportunity

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,720
to be better with excellence there's a

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,360
humility that says

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
i don't know

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
thank you so much for this opportunity

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
to speak to you

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,360
i hope you've had a wonderful conference

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,839
and you take away not only information

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,279
but virtual friendships

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,600
and inclusion isn't just

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,320
the responsibility of leaders it's all

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,279
of ours

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,440
the biggest impact is the space that we

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,600
create for one another

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
jesse jackson said our premise is that

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
inclusion leads to growth

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
so for those who are locked out they

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,920
lose development

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,920
and those who are in power lose market

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,040
and growth so inclusion is conducive

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
to the business the greatest asset of

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,399
any company

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,440
is its ability to create a space where

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,880
diverse minds

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
and identities can flourish thank you so

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,839
much

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,839
