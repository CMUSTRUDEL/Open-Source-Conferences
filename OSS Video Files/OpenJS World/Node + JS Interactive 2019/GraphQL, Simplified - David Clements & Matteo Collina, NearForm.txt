	GraphQL, Simplified - David Clements & Matteo Collina, NearForm 
Speakers: David Clements
Use React? Use GraphQL? Love Hooks? Graphql-hooks is a new GraphQL client for React with a hooks-first API. It’s super fast and weighs only 1.9kB gzipped.

The motivation behind graphql-hooks was a barebones GraphQL Client, focused on speed and lightweight. Both Apollo and Relay have pioneered how to use GraphQL on the client. However, over the years they’ve grown in size and complexity. This has increased the barrier to entry for new developers excited to try out GraphQL.

In this workshop, David and Matteo will be demonstrating how quick and simple it is to get up and running with the graphql-hooks client and fastify-gql GraphQL server library to produce an easily maintainable and high performance fullstack GraphQL implementation.
