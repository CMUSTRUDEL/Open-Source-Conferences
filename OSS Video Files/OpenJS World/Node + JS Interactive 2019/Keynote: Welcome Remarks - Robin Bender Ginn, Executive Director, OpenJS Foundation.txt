Oh welcome I'm actually Robin not Robert

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,320

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,860
to give a few brief housekeeping notes

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,840
before we get started if you don't know

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,360

all your coffee breaks and lunch and

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,140
there's also plenty of working space if

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,520
you want to catch up on email or have

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,670
some meetings with folks who meet on the

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,350
floor Wi-Fi information there's a link

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,439
on the schedule on the back of your

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,990
badge and finally last but not least

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,810
please get to know our event code of

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,110
conduct and essentially all attendees

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,060
should feel really welcome here and if

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,369
you have anything or you see anything

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:27,560
please talk to our event staff right

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:30,090
away so let's get started all right so

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,270
people are really surprised to learn

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,479
that over 95% of the world's websites

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,579
depend on JavaScript I'm so really most

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,470
people are using JavaScript whether they

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,229
know it or not

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,750
and today JavaScript continues to hold

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,329
the top ranking among many developer

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,159
surveys so for example the github octa

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,549
verse that was just release has

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,159
JavaScript as the most popular by repo

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,960
contributions and again it's a top

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,560
programming language in red Munk in

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,430
their language survey so no doubt this

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,590
is an ecosystem that is undeniably large

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,289
but it which really makes it sometimes

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,720
difficult for emerging technologies and

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,250
new projects to really breakthrough and

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,810
assess

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:21,500
market so the challenge for us all is

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,200
how do we keep JavaScript trustworthy

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,300
and modern with this huge user base it

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,350
truly is a humbling and an awesome

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,660
responsibility and so this is where the

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,760
open J's foundation plays a role when a

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,670
technology becomes like really super

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,670
important and many people depend on it

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,440
it's often donated to a foundation so it

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,290
can be sort of cared for in a neutral

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,390
home and the open J's foundations knew

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,180
but were really built on years of

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,100
experience as you know when the J's

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,670
foundation and the node Foundation came

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,530
together we really took and built from

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,709
the best of both worlds and really

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,570
created this new wonderful thing and in

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,870
fact I kind of go way back with the node

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,040
foundation I was part of the original

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,770
open-source team at Microsoft that

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
helped create the node foundation

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,580
because we knew that putting node under

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,800
a neutral foundation would really help

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,860
increase its contributions and set it up

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,640
for further success and as you know node

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,130
is now 10 years old and it's everywhere

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,650
including many great apps and companies

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,459
that you know and love and one of my

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,340
favorite examples is NASA NASA uses node

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,799
and JavaScript for spacesuit solutions

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,480
and it helps keep astronauts safe just

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,290
like Jessica and Christina did last

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,660
month so I think that's pretty cool

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,110
so at the node foundation we have over

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,299
30 of the most important open-source

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,700
JavaScript projects that are really

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:58,340
critical to the web and Beyond including

00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,950
appium dojo jquery node and web pack and

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,049
our projects are in the top 100

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,230
javascript libraries that provide a

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,880
variety of solutions and include many of

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,780
the frameworks and dev tools for a

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,730
modern web and if you don't no you may

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,780
not you may think you don't need jQuery

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,760
but really it's still widely used today

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,799
and are really our members make it

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,900
happen they provide the financial

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,050
support and the a lot of the governance

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,419
leadership that really

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,699
it drives our organization forward so

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,610
thanks if if any of you are in here

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,440
raise your hand if you remember and if

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,509
you ever have questions find these folks

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,710
they're really an essential part of our

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:44,259
organization great so we've had a great

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,819
year since March when we reformed and

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,370
we've welcomed some really awesome

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:50,740
incubation projects to the organization

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,919
now the incubation project is when a

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,289
project is going is joins the foundation

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,500
they kind of go through an onboarding

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:01,389
checklist before they join so node

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,430
version manager nvm was our first

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,099
project we welcomed and if you know why

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,699
mbm is a widely used method to install

00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:12,610
nodejs and manage multiple versions and

00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,169
recently google brought amp to the

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,050
foundation now

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,449
amp is used in 30 million domains and

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,900
billions of pages and what it does is it

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,569
helps websites have pages that load more

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,819
quickly and it's implemented in Google

00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,620
and in Bing and Pinterest and Pantheon

00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:35,169
so that was pretty exciting

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,180
and recently FASTA file and FASTA Phi is

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:41,430
partially sponsored by NIR form so we

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,080
thank them and fast if I is one of the

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,419
one of the great developer experiences

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,300
that helps provide a great experience

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,919
with low overheads so that was pretty

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,960
cool and if you don't know faster Phi is

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,930
used in car to go and Vectra and many

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,870
other apps so that's pretty cool but

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,719
today we have some more exciting news

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,719
today we're wealthy welcoming a new

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:06,879
incubation project so I am thrilled

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,219
today to announce that the open source

00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,350
web framework electron has joined the

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,459
foundation

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,459
[Music]

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,890
awesome so it sounds like you all know

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,330
electron that's pretty awesome electron

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,480
really is an easy way to build

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,670
cross-platform desktop apps and Wow is

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,900
it widely used we're talking Skype

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:34,440
Visual Studio code slack twitch what's

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,470
happened more an electron was developed

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,830
initially by github in 2013 but as you

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,140
all know it's really maintained by

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,090
several people across many organizations

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,310
today so that's pretty exciting

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,380
the last year they've moved to more of

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,940
an open governance model that I talked

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,430
earlier and I'll talk more about sort of

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,460
that neutral I'm decision-making process

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,820
and we're just excited and honored that

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,140
they've really kind of put the trust in

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,690
the foundation to move this project

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,790
forward and today I really want to

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,710
especially thank some of the project

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,170
leads Jacob groundwater and John

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,450
Kleinschmidt from Microsoft and Felix

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,700
rice Birgit slack so thanks thanks all

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,020
it's been a really great and tomorrow

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,670
you'll get to hear more from Jon and

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,040
Felix and their keynotes and breakout

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,970
sessions so great news today so I'm

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,710
going to tell you a little bit more

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,260
about the foundation on how we kind of

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,370
create that neutral a space to kind of

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,690
nurture these technologies we've created

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,700
kind of some policies and process that

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,970
really prioritized stability and

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,710
openness all of our conversations as

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,450
much as possible are held in the open

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,670
you're all welcome to join we publish

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,200
our calendar it's on YouTube

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,870
if you want to catch up on what we've

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,140
been doing and we really encourage

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,630
decision making at all levels and you'll

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,610
also see a lot of our members working

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,950
actively in the standard space equi and

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,910
the w3c and more so that's really

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,980
important as well and since we became an

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,680
umbrella organization one of our big

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,960
goals was to really create a governance

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,510
process that gave a strong voice to our

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,280
projects we have a great board that sets

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,570
our vision we have a cross project

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,090
Council that guides some of the

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,610
technical governance and we have an

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,969
amazing staff that supports our projects

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,829
with marketing and legal

00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,869
program management in all these events

00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:28,749
around the world that bring people

00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:31,869
together but truly we want to like

00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:34,389
create a place where each project can

00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:36,789
operate independently but the foundation

00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:39,310
is really removing that friction so you

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:43,750
can grow and make your project more

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:46,000
system successful another important part

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,709
of what we've been doing is our

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,300
certification program and this is

00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,860
something that had been in demand by the

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,040
community for the last couple of years

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,350
we had a lot of feedback from github on

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,910
how to shape that and we're really

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,279
fortunate to work with node source and

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,480
near forum to help craft that and Adrian

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,120
and Dave are going to talk a little bit

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,480
more about the certification program

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,279
later today but really think it's really

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,670
a great way to showcase your abilities

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:17,230
with node and allow companies to find

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,889
top talent in the market so you know I'm

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,199
new here

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,819
I'm kind of on my third month but in a

00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,769
way it sort of was like stepping into an

00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,970
extended family much like you know if

00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,209
you work a lot in the open-source

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,639
community but people since I left

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,860
Microsoft still like to say Robin wasn't

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,399
it hard working on open source at

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,519
Microsoft ten years ago and the answer

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,759
is a little but mostly no I mean the

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,589
community has always been so welcoming

00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,740
but really truly I learned so many

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,389
lessons from the people I met on the way

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,790
wonderful words of wisdom and one of my

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,069
favorite was from Jean Pelle who is my

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,000
boss at the time and he would always

00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:00,759
tell us team one plus one equals three

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,939
and that's when the value of being

00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,790
together is better than being apart so

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:09,279
that really you know is sort of shaping

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:14,529
how I think about how we work at the

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:17,019
open J's foundation so M s open tech one

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:20,199
plus one equals three meant engineering

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,660
marketing policy we all had a seat at

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,309
the table to ensure a project success

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,559
you need everybody at the table

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:29,379
it also means working with your

00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,980
competitors and partners to really help

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,959
the customers that everybody shares so

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,220
for me that really sort of is the spirit

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,270
of how the node

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,830
the Jas Foundation came together to you

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,470
know to really sort of strengthen

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:51,130
improve how we serve the JavaScript

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:54,430
community so I covered a lot today but

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,820
did I answer the challenge question well

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,670
no probably not entirely because you

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,330
know we don't have all of the answers

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:07,330
however the foundation really has a

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,730
solid footing and a start and I made a

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,340
lot of amazing people to carry the

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,900
JavaScript ecosystem forward and carry

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,400
it in the future and actually miles is

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,670
going to talk a little bit soon about

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,680
the future of JavaScript so this week I

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,160
challenge all of you to dig in on some

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,380
of these issues that I've just covered

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:31,410
collaborate learn from each other and

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,410
remember that one plus one equals three

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,330
and really truly invite you to help

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,070
shape the future of JavaScript the

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,900
rewards you make will be things that you

00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,510
discover about yourself like I did in my

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,370
journey with open source and the the

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,300
wisdom that you share with your new

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,430
friends in the JavaScript community one

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,390
