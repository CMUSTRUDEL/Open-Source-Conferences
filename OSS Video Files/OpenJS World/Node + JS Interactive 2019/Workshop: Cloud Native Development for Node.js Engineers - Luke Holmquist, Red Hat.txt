	Workshop: Cloud Native Development for Node.js Engineers - Luke Holmquist, Red Hat
Speakers: Lucas Holmquist
As cloud services and deployment platforms have come to bear more and more responsibility for the “Enterprise” features of modern application development, Node.js becomes more appealing for enterprise engineers who want to take advantage of its light weight, quick startup time, developer productivity and overall happiness.

But cloud native development can seem daunting. How do you both write an app and also deal with automation, service discovery, observability, immutability, scalability and all of the other cloud native and practices?

It’s a lot to keep track of. It’s a lot to do. It’s scary!

But it doesn’t have to be. In this workshop you will learn how to develop and deploy Kubernetes managed Node.js applications. By the time we’re done, you will have created a Node.js application backed by Node.js microservices, and deployed it to a live Kubernetes cluster.
