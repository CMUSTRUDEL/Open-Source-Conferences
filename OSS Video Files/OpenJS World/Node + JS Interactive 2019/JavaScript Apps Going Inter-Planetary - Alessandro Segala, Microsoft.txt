	JavaScript Apps Going Inter-Planetary - Alessandro Segala, Microsoft
Speakers: Alessandro Segala
What if the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) could run on the distributed web? Meet IPFS, or the Inter-Planetary File System, a new way to serve static files and apps in a distributed way.

Come to this session and see how you can run your own static JavaScript apps on IPFS, and make them ready for primetime. Youâ€™ll learn how to ensure high availability for your app, making it accessible to anyone over HTTPS (thanks Cloudflare!), and how to enable Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (using Azure Pipelines).
