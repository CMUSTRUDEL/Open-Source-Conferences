	Learning to Read Music with the Web MIDI API - Jan Kleinert & Ryan Jarvinen, Red Hat
Speakers: Ryan Jarvinen, Jan Kleinert
Getting students to practice piano - or any instrument - can be a challenge, but combining learning with technology and games in an interactive way can make practice more enticing. With a digital keyboard, JavaScript, and the Web MIDI API, Jan created a web app to help her kids practice reading music. Through demos and an exploration of how the app was built, you'll learn the basics of MIDI and the Web MIDI API and maybe a thing or two about reading music, too!
