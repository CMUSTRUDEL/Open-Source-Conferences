	Why You Should Maintain Type Definitions for Your JavaScript Project - Ethan Arrowood, Microsoft
Speakers: Ethan Arrowood
TypeScript support is one of the most sought-after features for any popular open source JavaScript project.

Fastify, a fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js, strives to treat TypeScript developers as first-class citizens even in a library written entirely in JavaScript. Since TypeScript 2.8 the Fastify team has been able to write and maintain our own type definition file shipped directly from Fastify itself. This has enabled our developers to rely on a single dependency and trust what they are using is always up-to-date.

This talk will share some of the lessons we've learned thus far, and it will explore some of the interesting changes we are making in the v3 refactor.
