this oh where are we gonna wear matching

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,530
outfits and I said I have a bunny suit

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,889
you were like cool yeah cool Joe

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,460
I remember this conversation oh man this

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,010
is awkward

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,830
yeah well as you can tell we have a

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,260
hair-raising good time together

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,039
now this is hot I'm gonna change if

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,800
you're not gonna wear your bunny suit

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,420
with me yes of course thank you all

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,930
right thank you all right Hopalong and I

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,719
guess I'll get started hi everyone my

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,989
name is George Burton and my colleague

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,469
Joe the bunny is joining me here but as

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,379
he dis robes d robes I want to tell you

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,489
a little bit about the first you know -

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,070
we're gonna talk about the first 200

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,989
days of our adventures as the open J's

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,390
Foundation cross-project Council but

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,640
just for some context even though the

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,440
open J's foundation itself is is a newer

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,010
organization we're built on a pretty

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,939
long history of open collaboration that

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,799
really started like like a long time ago

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:10,020
with the jquery project with the dojo

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,610
projects independently coming together

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,840
and realizing hey we need to work

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,270
together in some neutral way to govern

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,119
and grow our communities so you know we

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,220
we've we've seen this as a community if

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,979
you if you started in javascript

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,130
development in the 2000s you know with

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,270
those projects with node announcing and

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,479
then growing to the point that

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,979
eventually it needed a foundation and

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,259
then realizing that hey in 2017 and 2018

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,210
there's a bit of a duplication of

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,750
efforts here like we could probably do

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,509
more together than we can then we can

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,390
separately so like let's let's share

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,250
this experience let's share this this

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,850
burden together and and kind of build

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,820
from there

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,290
so where do we fit into this is sort of

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,840
the next question like you know if we

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,380
think about our foundation having a bit

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,620
of an origin story this long history of

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,560
growing and learning and

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:13,270
shirring like myself I came into the

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,790
picture with jQuery in the late 2010s

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,140
and I started watching my colleagues who

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,090
were working on jQuery and I got

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,820
involved in the project and said gosh

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,440
this is really fascinating like how

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,960
these groups are coming together to

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,230
decide you know what sorts of things we

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,480
should add to our project is very it's

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,800
it's it's really cool like it's it was

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,800
unlike anything I'd ever seen before I

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,430
enjoyed working in a team that way and

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,580
that kind of started my falling down the

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,090
rabbit hole if you will into open-source

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,860
yeah I started when I worked at Sears a

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,290
long time ago if anyone remembers Sears

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,790
and when I was there there there was a

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,550
really great community of developers

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,440
there in terms of the team we were doing

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,890
a lot of brown bag lunch and learns and

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,730
going to meetups and a really great

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,170
community and from there everywhere I

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,480
went I was always kind of trying to

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,290
replicate that or find that again ended

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,930
up working at strongloop and IBM and got

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,730
involved in the node foundation and

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,070
found it to be a welcoming community and

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,130
also very accessible because everything

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:27,640
that we were doing was out in the open

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:30,850
so that's how I got into it I think you

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,580
know following along on that thought the

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,590
the foundation I think we have some

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,310
notes here too huh you know Wow yeah all

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,310
right there my head

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,510
you know we had started the the

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,270
foundation the the project moved into

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,269
the foundation and all of that activity

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,570
was happening online and working through

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,510
it

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,390
and and it definitely like in a

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,150
radically open sort of way and I think

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,140
that's sort of one of those values that

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,720
having brought forward from the node

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,790
project into the foundation that that is

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,560
sort of an example of experience lessons

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,560
learned exactly I think so

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,799
so the intent to merge was announced

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:18,729
last year at nodejs

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,350
interactive and immediately we started

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:25,120
kind of doing this radical in the open

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,229
collaborating and you know this is at

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,350
the collab someone on the left in the

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,360
big picture but even the window the

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,490
post-it notes that was during the event

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,800
we broke off into different groups and

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,300
started to talk about how something like

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,930
this could work and how things would

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,490
come together and how we would kind of

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,800
bring all the things that we had in both

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,229
the the Foundation's together to make a

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,030
greater space I loved it because it was

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,220
like this immediate excitement to like

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,960
you know great we're sharing this this

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,669
next step with the community like let's

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,250
get started on it like right away and

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,380
you know so hey we got this beautiful

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,660
glass wall let's get up and get to work

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,310
and and and that in that instance - it

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,539
was two people from the the Jay s

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,490
Foundation and two people from the node

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,870
foundation you know new people getting

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,090
together and working things out it was

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,310
really great so we hope that you imagine

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,810
now sharing our origin stories here like

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,979
this could be you know part of hopefully

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,039
this part of your origin story with

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,870
foundation like imagine yourself five

00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:24,039
years from now thinking about right now

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,800
when you get involved with me so we we

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:31,440
thought you know that was just over a

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,760
year ago now and since we announced our

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,889
intent to merge and well then we became

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,190
officially the open J's foundation in

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:41,979
March of this year we've had over 40

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,220
cross project council meetings of an

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,870
hour or more so this is lots and lots of

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,150
hours of lots and lots of people's times

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,370
all on the open that we've been

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,650
broadcasting these things on YouTube you

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:58,330
can go read the read the minutes on

00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:00,400
github and we've had we're growing 66

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,990
people and accounting to our github

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,570
organization and these are people who

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,010
are joining the across project councilor

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,510
and participating in some someway so

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,160
yeah and and the there are few other

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,690
repos there as well like the summit's

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,729
that people are getting involved in and

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,380
I just want to come into that you know

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,210
Joey wanted to put a hard line on the

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,490
CPC meetings like whenever we are the

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,229
official CPC

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,870
but we were the bootstrap committee

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,669
before that working on you know making

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,370
this happen so it was actually well over

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:34,680
40 but yeah we have 217 commits to the

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,830
CPC repo as of yesterday morning or

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,470
something so lots of activity

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:45,539
I found this graph this is from pretty

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:49,889
much from the events the the last year's

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:51,599
no Jess interactive and for the first

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,000
like third of that is the bootstrap work

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,940
and then we just renamed the project but

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,710
just I mean that's a lot of activity

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,060
it's been really great a lot of people

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,130
from a lot of different projects working

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:09,090
really hard yeah and we have this

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,449
collaboration page get open JSF org

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,190
slash collaboration where you can there

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,130
a variety of resources there but in

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,370
particular links to the the github work

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,720
that we're doing which like I said like

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,440
everything that we're doing is out in

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,259
the open

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,690
streaming meetings meeting notes are

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,020
being merged in all these things yeah

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,190
definitely so check this out so you know

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,360
the next question on it's like okay

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,009
we're doing all this stuff in the open

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,690
and you might be going okay great but

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:39,060
like why what's the purpose of the cross

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,880
project Council what do you do and

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,780
really for us we were thinking about

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,719
this as the task of helping our

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,819
community build their communities each

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,409
of our projects is special and has their

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,770
own needs and they're they're they're

00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:57,120
unique and they're awesome and we don't

00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,789
we want to support that we want to

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,259
encourage that we want to grow that but

00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,400
there's also a lot of shared needs and

00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,479
there's a lot of great things we can

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,569
learn from each other and there's a lot

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,360
of synergy we can create if we are

00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:12,930
building those communities together so I

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,000
love this analogy of like an urban City

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,780
right where that city has its own sort

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,940
of you know identity but within the city

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,250
there's also lots of the communities

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,530
that that make make it up that make it

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:30,030
rich that make it meaningful and awesome

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,760
and so that's what we hope to be able to

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,349
foster we're 200 days in so you know

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,200
it's a long time to build an awesome

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:42,880
City but project neighborhoods project

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,980
neighborhoods yes so we wanted to tell

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,120
you a little bit about what we're doing

00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:53,200
with with all of this energy and you

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,810
know again 200 days is like not a super

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,420
lot of time but I think we've made

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,279
pretty good progress we meet weekly I

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,959
keep thinking like Oh ventually will go

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:10,450
every other week but we have a full

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:12,339
agenda so you know what if we what have

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,760
we been talking about with those those

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,770
hours we are obviously spending a lot of

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,740
time thinking about creating and

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,060
sustaining community programming which

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,410
will tell you a little bit more about

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,630
some of those programs here in a minute

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,579
but you know there's a lot of things we

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,910
want to provide yeah and and you know

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,350
we've already got four new projects to

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,810
the foundation so there's been a lot of

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,149
work around that not only you know

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,890
evaluating applications but also like

00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,930
what does the process look like and then

00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,570
as people are coming into we're learning

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,529
through that process and updating and

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,690
what's great is the people that are

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,190
coming in are contributing you know

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,170
they're creating pull requests and

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,760
issues and driving some of these

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,130
conversations so it's been really great

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,230
yeah and I want to thank Toby angel who

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,839
runs with the ant project he's been like

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,579
super super helpful to that regard so

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,649
you know we're onboarding our new

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:05,220
incubating projects we've got our

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,290
existing projects that we're helping to

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,450
update their policies and also making

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,600
sure that we're sharing best practices

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,029
across our projects and you know also

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,029
very very importantly supporting our

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,310
maintainer right so the maintenance of

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:23,050
these projects is huge and we want to

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,120
make sure that everybody feels like they

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,420
have the support and the resources of

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,560
the ecosystem behind them when they have

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,540
to do whatever it is they need to do

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,130
lots of stuff so we hope that you're

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,270
excited about all of this stuff when we

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,370
tell you about a little bit of the

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,470
projects now

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,579
some of our some of our programs and

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:49,060
this is just like the start so you know

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:52,329
bear that in mind yes so the travel fund

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,819
is is one of the programs that you know

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,110
we're working on currently it was

00:10:54,819 --> 00:11:00,639
started in the note foundation in 2016

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,889
we've had over 30 requests approve in

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,649
2019 I know of several people who are

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,680
here because of the travel fund so it's

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:12,009
really great if you get involved and you

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,319
want to come to Austin in the June where

00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:16,569
the event will be next year you know

00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:17,829
that's something you can consider as you

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:20,980
know someone a part of the work that

00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:23,079
we're doing and it started in the note

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,399
foundation but we're looking there a few

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,519
projects that we're looking to elevate

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:31,240
to allow other projects to take greater

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,089
advantage of this and I think Jonah from

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,620
from webpack is an example of just

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:37,329
somebody from the community who says hey

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,740
I want to you know help champion this

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,689
and involved that's a little bit more so

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,850
yeah yeah he was he was great that's

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:46,060
another thing like if if you're

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,990
interested in getting involved like Jory

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,130
was saying Jonah just volunteered and

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,170
we've got a lot of great people in the

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,730
community that if you volunteer they're

00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,870
happy to help support you it's just not

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,300
something that they may be able to

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,009
champion but we've got a lot of folks

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,630
that are ready to support anyone who

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,839
wants to get involved and get active

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,449
yeah so with this we're really hoping to

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,130
make sure that that anybody who's a

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,660
contributor to our project communities

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,329
feels like this is a resource they can

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,730
access to help get them places they may

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,470
not be able to go because perhaps of an

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,699
employer doesn't quite sponsor all the

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,120
costs and all that sort of things so

00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:24,160
very valuable so you know another

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,259
program that we're working on is the

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,230
standards working group in the open Jas

00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:32,170
foundation so you know open source and

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,339
open standards are two halves of a coin

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,149
that are very important and are very

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,069
important to me and we are a proud

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:40,470
member of the w3c and also ACMA

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:45,160
International which is the group behind

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:47,829
tc39 there is a lot of feedback we can

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,990
be providing the standards community

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,610
there's a lot of feedback the standards

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,930
community

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,300
can be providing us we want to make sure

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,890
that folks who are active in our project

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,529
communities feel they have a voice in

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,870
these spaces and understand how they can

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,540
get involved we're we are constantly

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,670
having those conversations with folks

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,310
like Wendy from the w3c who is here a

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,560
little early earlier we want to make

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,100
that a very clear program and benefit

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,930
for our yeah and on that note - like

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,120
maintainer x' have enough work to do

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,740
like if we can help them as a part of

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,140
the foundation to work with these

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,269
standards groups you know and then bring

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,260
things back to the projects you know

00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:30,630
it's definitely something we'd like to

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:35,130
do user feedback is another program that

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:38,070
started in node and it started in 2017

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,079
that image there is one of the surveys

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,850
that we did this seems like another

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,029
thing that would be great for you know

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,740
more projects in the foundation the idea

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,500
is we would have a framework in place

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,959
and and this is a fairly fleshed out I

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,480
need to still move the repo over to to

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,180
the open JSF fort but a framework in

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,130
place where projects who are trying to

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,500
make decisions but want to get data on

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,320
you know questions they may have

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,790
can can you know craft craft these

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,130
questions work with the foundation to

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,570
maybe further flush them out to make

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,459
sure they're they're gonna get the data

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,500
points that they're looking for and then

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,260
the foundation can help them execute and

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,430
you know return some some data back to

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,459
them to help them make these decisions

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,600
and work through different you know

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,320
whether they're features or

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,510
what-have-you

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,100
be very helpful I mean I'm really

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,870
excited about this particular program

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,790
because I think it will be awesome when

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,709
we can as a community work in a more

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,529
like data-driven way and we have this

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:36,980
sort of like system for how we ask

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:39,000
questions of our community and we

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,140
integrate the the feedback and the

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,019
lessons learned from that those

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,649
questions one thing here's a program

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,970
idea anybody love like bigquery and HTTP

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:49,649
archive and all that sort of stuff like

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:55,970
let's do some let's do some stuff with

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:59,069
that the great feedback yeah

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,140
infrastructure so this is another set of

00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,840
programs that we're really I'm just sort

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,050
of diving into all of

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,360
these open-source projects need

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:12,350
infrastructure and it is a mess sometime

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,030
so we have a menu of services that the

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,610
infrastructure services that the

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:20,030
foundation provides and that's sort of a

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,950
baseline in terms of you know what what

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:25,550
a project might need in terms of servers

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,730
in terms of CI support you know domains

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,860
those are the data and that that's sort

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,330
of just the starting point but there's

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,980
lots of other infrastructure needs to

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,740
that especially are some of our larger

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:41,540
projects might have and we are excited

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,090
about getting more into helping ease the

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,300
burden for those projects when it comes

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,640
to you know their infrastructure needs

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,950
and that's certainly a space that if you

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,520
have DevOps DevOps skills that this is

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:58,160
something that you are excited about

00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,480
influencing the this is a program that I

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,330
want desperately to talk to you about

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,000
yeah yeah and the the node the node

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,500
project in particular you know that's

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,650
something that we're working on for sure

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,840
and then with you know amp joining we

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,250
have a session tomorrow to kind of work

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,300
through some of those thoughts as well

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,780
which is my Segway yeah

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,370
[Laughter]

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,160
so you know another program that we are

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,080
managing and trying to build upon is the

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,910
collaborator summits which I mentioned

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,460
you know we have a bunch of great

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,060
sessions there tomorrow some around

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,860
nodes some around amps I'm around just

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,990
kind of general how do we support these

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,600
projects better we have a bunch of open

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,770
time for the cross project Council to

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,730
kind of flesh some other things that

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:48,500
were working out further what else for

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,410
the collapse on that well I think it's

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,810
just a really it's a wonderful time for

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,280
people from all the different project

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,320
communities to come together and talk

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,470
about some of those shared experiences

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,270
and shared concerns like security for

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,610
example or infrastructure as I mentioned

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,350
before but also you know and how to

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,830
solve those things tactically but also

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,850
for more of like the blue sky

00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:13,400
conversations of like what could we be

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:15,230
doing what can we do to make things you

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,740
know even

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,089
and that's that's one of the main topics

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,280
of the conversation tomorrow so we're

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,919
hoping to seed that now a little bit

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,329
yeah we we had I think the one in Berlin

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,840
was kind of the first one that was

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,850
opened up beyond node and we had some

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,770
really great healthy conversations and

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,290
different voices and these conversations

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:43,040
and I found it to be really a great

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:44,480
event like way and so there I mean these

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,559
are some specific programs we've talked

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,540
about but there's also a lot of other

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,240
benefits to projects within the

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,860
foundation that the CPC helps facilitate

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,809
to to a large extent one is for our

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,650
projects providing some just legal

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,630
support so you know there's obviously

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,160
the standard you know IP policies and

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,410
things like that but you know you may be

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,610
saying oh well I want to understand a

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,309
little bit more about the difference

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,809
between you should my project have a CLA

00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,280
it should we use the DCO which what

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,830
should we do like these are kinds of

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,980
questions that the foundation staff and

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,919
the the support from the CPC your peers

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,240
in the community can help you answer

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,780
project governance support there's a lot

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,059
of years of experience managing open

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,549
source projects among the individuals on

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,890
the CPC for example Dylan Shimon who's

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,690
with the dojo project he's been around

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,520
for a while right like dude has seen

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,799
some stuff so if you have questions if

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,059
you're running into you know oh gosh

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,220
what should I do you need some advice

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:47,210
there's so many people who are willing

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,530
to help mentor you not just on a project

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,210
but also like in your career they're

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,510
like awesome people yeah agreed

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:57,380
and then of course I would be totally

00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,799
remiss if I didn't talk about the staffs

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,410
marketing and NPR Rachel romoff is just

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:09,049
amazing and our our new executive

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:11,690
director Robin not Robert and bring with

00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,750
them a lot of marketing and PR expertise

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,610
to help you kind of think about your

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,640
project your positioning like how to

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,730
tell the story that you want to tell to

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,690
your community to potential consumers to

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:32,870
potential contributors as well

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:35,060
the tutu about your project what else if

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,340
there's anything that you know and again

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,520
bearing in mind that we're still new CPC

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,710
200 days if there's anything that you

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,440
see missing or you'd like to see us do

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,480
or you think we can be doing better

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,730
which is probably you know not like it's

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,430
probably a lot right there's always room

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,070
for improvement um we would love to hear

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,780
from you yeah there are a variety of

00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,730
ways to get involved and we wanted this

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:04,820
to kind of you know come to a call to

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,860
action of sorts like we've said we work

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,760
out in the open the magic happens and

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:13,310
issues and PRS we have a good well

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,360
documented proposal process so if you

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,460
get involved and there's something

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,670
you're interested in you know you can

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,010
follow those steps it's not too hard

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:26,210
help and improve and maintain existing

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,310
programs there's just there's a lot of

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,840
work to be done and we've got a great

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,820
group of people but we could we could

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,740
definitely use more and start to split

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,090
off into some working groups and things

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,100
like that to where we can really focus

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:42,770
on things yeah so we adopted a four

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,830
program ideas for improvements that sort

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:47,600
of thing we adopted a staging process

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,520
because we're engineers like oh we're

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,030
gonna do this like tc39 Desmond's thing

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,710
process so you know ideas that we say

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,810
are stage zero or stage one these are

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,710
sort of like you know any they're open

00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,030
they're for grabs

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,110
somebody threw some spaghetti at a wall

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,370
and they thought like this might be a

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,880
good idea and we're like yeah that could

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:07,460
be a good idea let's save that and we're

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,100
looking for you know help or support

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,010
with that so like like Commons j/s is

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,170
one idea outreach groups is another idea

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:20,450
I don't know I always split always I'm

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:22,640
one of those who's like so yeah and

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,290
again we're gonna have some sessions at

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,330

00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:32,360

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,899
factor for you so if there's a thing in
