they're for your church quick show of

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:25,650
hands who writes JavaScript's yes you're

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:30,690
my people who writes no okay even better

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:34,860
you're at the right conference MPM who

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:38,250
uses fpm great thank you thank you who

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,450
uses yarn it's okay that's okay that's

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,880
okay we're all friends

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,760
anybody use yarn with a PMP you flag

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,740
anybody try to test it out no plug and

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,200
play okay anybody just PMPM anybody hey

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,820
cool look okay cool you're probably like

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,590
thinking is he having a stroke what's

00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:00,320
being cool so I'm sure everybody has run

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,470
this right anybody run this today

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,720
anybody

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,770
yeah it's couple Roy who works on my

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,430
team so you do this a lot right you do

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,140
this a lot a lot a lot a lot and your CI

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,739
systems are probably running this right

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,530
they run this a lot even more lot lot

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,230
lot this is sort of the BART system like

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,530
writing on a chalkboard type thing how

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,850
many downloads do you think are installs

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,560
or package downloads do you think are in

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,510
a month and for the folks don't go

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,060
cheating and go check what it is any

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:44,430
ideas guesses across all NPM in the last

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:46,890
month last month 32 whoa okay so I like

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,400
that I like that anybody else any

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,830
guesses

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:57,060
a hundred million anybody gonna go for

00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:00,270
like one prices right style no okay yeah

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,770
okay so we are 58 plus billions so that

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,989
you guys really like to install you

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,840
folks would like to install packages

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,090
right and just to show you a little

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,700
graph about this sort of exponential

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,910
growth NPM celebrated its ten-year

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,560
anniversary a couple months ago and we

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,420
have this nice little video I'm sure for

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,629
good of audio

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,629
[Music]

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,490
so we're ten years old as of I think

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,809
September

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,809
[Music]

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,569
[Music]

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:49,140
jQuery moves plug-in stamp yum awesome

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:52,860
huge milestones right IP m5s released in

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,290
2017 MPX a lot of people use MPX yeah

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,500
nice one of the best things in the world

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,380
yeah holy cow

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,090
so over a million packages published

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,890
that's awesome ten years cool so that's

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,450
all awesome but let's look beyond that

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,400
right you do this thing a lot you know

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,680
it a lot of it a lot probably probably

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,470
know better than I do

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,170
so let's talk about these things these

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,880
these disparate things we're gonna talk

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,510
about the PACU minute how many know what

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,760
that is already a lot of people great

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,470
sweet I'm gonna tell you a little bit

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,020
about something that you don't know we

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,250
talked a little bit about sustainability

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,200
the community maintenance in

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,300
contributing and a few other things I'm

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,390
even gonna showcase some cool stuff that

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,700
I don't think you've seen yet

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,220
so what happens when you install sir the

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:48,660
coals notes here and we actually fat to

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,730
fetch this thing called a packet and so

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,400
the NPM CLI touches the document and

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,690
that has a reference to where the tar

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,550
ball lives where essentially your

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,410
package is actually living at rest then

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,100
we go and we download that tar bowl

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,560
unpack it and do a bunch of other stuff

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,830
so documents if you're wondering yes it

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,510
is just a really really hacky word that

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,980
we threw together it's called it's a

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,310
package document right so if you ever

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,980
hear node node folks talking about

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,780
document objects or POC you mints

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,750
they're talking about package documents

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,480
fun right cool it's kind of like codec

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,200
right everybody know codec is like also

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,220
look yeah okay well I know I got a lot

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,600
of people didn't know that slaves just

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:36,240
like compression and decompression codec

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,840
put together really cool sorry coder

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,450
decoder

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,660
yeah coder or encoding I'm cool so this

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:45,240
is what it looks like this is a sort of

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,460
the shape of this object it looks a lot

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,560
like a package.json right it's got a

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,240
bunch of information in here but it's

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,680
got some information in here that you

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,050
may not have thought it's got references

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,150
to maintain errs it's where it got

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,550
references to all the versions that

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,830
you've published and actually if we look

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,560
I can show you a live version of this

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,470
so here's lo dashes packing mints it's

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,880
sort of it's got things like this tags

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,870
on it

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,810
this is mutable data that essentially

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,550
NPM controls and so let's say you add or

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,430
remove somebody from your team the

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,330
maintainer x' object will update

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,590
accordingly right so this is not

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,590
immutable data

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,240
this is mutable data that is not a

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,010
one-to-one mapping to your package JSON

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,630
but it's something a little bit more

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,410
substantial and you can actually go and

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:38,590
check out this information the URL is

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:42,400
just registries org and then the package

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:45,160
name right cool so if you take away one

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,800
thing from this talk and you're like

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,919
actually told me one thing when you hear

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,610
a pack min is not equal to a

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,400
package.json file it is mutable record

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:01,000
and MPM is typically the source of truth

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,680
for all your packages in most cases if

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,639
you've ever used yarn yarn has alias or

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,139
essentially a cname which I forget what

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,870
the actual domain is but we actually

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,669
mapped right directly to our at the NPM

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,320
registry so for using yarn you're

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,949
actually using the NPM registry still

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,780
and for a packaged registry if you can't

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,639
find the package in there

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,190
if github can't find the package

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,570
information it will actually just proxy

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,070
down to MPN which is so I'm p.m. the

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,810
registry is essentially the source of

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:40,330
truth for MPM packages cool so that's a

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,370
little bit about sort of interesting

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,160
information that about your packages you

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,080
may not know and sort of high-level

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,200
concept around that let's talk a little

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,450
bit about open source sustainability so

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,970
did anybody get this prompts over the

00:08:52,450 --> 00:09:00,750
summer anybody see this anybody use

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:05,020
standard Jas right ran a little

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,600
experiments to try to figure out a way

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:12,940
or a mechanism to help funding

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,380
fund his open source efforts and so what

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,970
they were doing there was essentially

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,800
running a post install scripts you

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,889
generate an ad in your terminal right

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,240
that sounds kind of messy and it is and

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,680
it's not necessarily something that we

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,800
that we think is actually good for the

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,860
community so NPM unfortunately had to

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,630
sort of enforce our policies and say you

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,000
know advertising in your terminal whole

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,069
post install scripts this is sort of a

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,959
abusive we don't want to see these types

00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,279
of things happening this is definitely

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,610
something that we don't think is good

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:50,050
for the community that said it was you

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:52,389
know definitely a symptom of something

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,000
that like we know that we needed to

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,040
address which was how do we support open

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,110
source software development how we how

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,899
do we make it economical and sustainable

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,839
for developers to essentially make money

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:07,449
through their through their work work

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:12,910
and so we wrote this plot blog post in

00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:15,130
late August and the key here was we

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,529
noted we know this has been a long time

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,290
coming MPM is in a great position to

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,720
help address this problem and the time

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,329
to solve it is now and just so you know

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,769
I've been at MPM for all of about four

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:29,649
months and this happened to coincide

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:32,470
with me starting there so this became my

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:36,610
number one goal is to how do we help or

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,139
make a difference here so as of NPM six

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,350
thirteen we landed something called

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:44,470
funding who's heard of funding field hey

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,899
buddy nice nice anybody using it

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:52,990
anybody define it for the packages Wes

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:54,430
nice Roy hopefully you tested it right

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,959
in the back works on my own team he's

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,139
actually the person that implemented in

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,220
the CLI so the funding field looks like

00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,280
this and this was a spec in sort of a

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,280
shape that we

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,750
had been seeing other third parties sort

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,770
of teams like open collective and the

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,650
package maintenance working group had

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,840
also start to draft a scheme around this

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,950
this type of field that would help

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,790
define a reference to a means for you to

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,950
drive traffic for specifically for an

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,830
option to fund your your open source

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,950
development so this is what it has it's

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,500
a it's a funding field and it's got two

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,080
keys there type and URL type is pretty

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,430
ambiguous right now we don't actually

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:47,790
have any kind of like way of sort of

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,080
transforming from the URL back down to

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,870
let's say github and in the future we

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,480
could see this being utilized for things

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,910
like foundation or corporate or the the

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,070
terminology could eventually become more

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,230
meaningful but right now the type is is

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,980
pretty pretty much there for decoration

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:10,750
the URL is a really important piece in

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:13,740
this in this spec so something

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,470
interesting now happens as of NPM 613

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,350
when you run IBM install you get this

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,730
nice little prompt three packages are

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,160
looking for funding now it's going to

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,040
change this number changes every every

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,680
time you run this but what we are doing

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,380
is essentially bubbling up when your

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,060
dependencies have defined this field we

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,410
were bubbling up the fact that you know

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,810
somebody has explicitly noted that they

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,460
would love if you could help fund them

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,060
or that they have a mechanism for you to

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,370
help fund or give them given the money

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:52,170
and if you run the NPM fun command it

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,820
will actually print out this nice tree

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,660
do some D duping as well which is really

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,260
nice and showcase these these references

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,330
and then if you actually brought an NPM

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,880
fund with the name of the package it

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,750
works very similar to MPN repo in which

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,400
it will try to figure out where to

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,520
essentially open up a browser and and

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,490
where to send traffic so I'll show you

00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,030
what that looks like so here I've got

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,510
terminal

00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:27,460
and this is we're gonna say what version

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:28,000
am I on 613 awesome if I Ron I'm yeah

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,790
minute

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,220
yes I couldn you package.json I install

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,590
some depths I'm gonna install this nice

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,250
dependency I've made called sleepover

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,960
it's really fun it's cool and I've

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,410
defined the funding field in my

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,780
package.json so if I run MP I'm fund it

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,840
shows me my information so I have a

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,640
github sponsors page they referenced and

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,470
if I run an MP and fun sleepover

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,420
they actually prompts and opens up that

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,180
page right so you can immediately go and

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,550
and donate or become a sponsor to me

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,530
feel free to buy me a coffee if you'd

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,910
like it's only five dollars a month to

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,720
support me

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,010
shameless plug cool so this this is

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,680
something we think is really meaningful

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:15,460
impactful it's really just the first

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,690
step in in us trying to help solve this

00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,330
problem with the community with the

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,040
community and we're we're excited about

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:24,220
where we think it can actually take us

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,320
and sort of moving forward and we've got

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,260
some some cool stuff coming down the

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,750
pipeline that'll talk to a couple of

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:36,190
minutes here so let's talk a little bit

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:39,400
about community so for NPM over the last

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:42,040
few years we had actually actually last

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,800
year we sort of jumped over and started

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,960
using discourse forums to run most of

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,080
our community discussion through and

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,580
discourse through and we've actually

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:57,280
since archived that discourse forum and

00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,610
are now driving our community back to

00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,000
github and gap issues we reopened issues

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,340
on the CLI which was which was much

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,340
appreciated I think by a number of you

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,680
know folks in community and if you

00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:15,550
actually go to the landing page today

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:19,090
you'll see a number of pieces of

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:21,820
information about public events calendar

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,370
that we now have available references to

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,730
our documentation are more tailored

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:32,579
support portal as well as the archive

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:34,540
for for forums which still do exist

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,389
and let's talk a little bit about

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,100
maintenance so if you ever want to know

00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:41,949
the health of let's say the registry you

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,600
can always go check status MPM J's org

00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,040
but there's actually a new project that

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
we've kicked off my team has kicked off

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,249
called the essentially the project

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,339
status board so you can actually go to

00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:57,279
our github org and you can go check out

00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:58,839
the health of all of our open source

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,519
projects and we're starting to bubble up

00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,829
this information not only for our own

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,589
team to identify where we need to

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,350
essentially fix or increase test

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:11,279
coverage or update licensing or terms or

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,199
what you know what packages have

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,420
vulnerabilities but it ad which will

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,370
help define essentially where we spend

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,279
our time but this is great to also

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,720
showcase and be proud of when let's say

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,850
the test coverage is a hundred percent

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,879
on a bunch of packages it's great to

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,300
show the community that this that we're

00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,779
working hard here so this is a sort of a

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,379
net new tool that we're using its

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,059
inspired by West West Todd who works on

00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:42,759
packaging maintenance working group

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:45,579
works at Netflix he built something very

00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,230
similar for Express and we sort of took

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,699
this concept and I've been running with

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,100
it we've got some really cool features

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,319
here you can show and hide columns you

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,680
can be like who you know who still

00:16:53,319 --> 00:17:01,269
supports like MPI or node version 0.8

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,289
I think we need to like archive that

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,600
project so yeah and test coverage is

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:10,569
like terrible so we need to need to get

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,069
that in shape so this is really for me

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,350
as in terms of like an engineering

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,059
manager or a project manager product

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,610
manager this is really good because it

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,640
helps identify at in sort of a

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:27,000
high-level view that the health of our

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,559
projects a 10:00 p.m. so contributing so

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,030
if your contribute to open source or

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,610
you're considering contributor open

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,830
source we've been trying to evolve in

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:40,059
and sort of grow the story of how you

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:43,690
can contribute to NPM and in our work we

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,340
do we are you know usually radically as

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,230
radically transparent as

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,840
possible you can actually go check out

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,600
our Kanban board you can go see like how

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,420
many people have like an open cheer or

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,310
Kanban board that you know like

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,250
everybody in the world can look at it

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,380
anybody anybody there's couple yeah Wow

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,210
okay if you maybe in the open source

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,420
there's a couple teams that will have

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,860
like opening up projects board I don't

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,930
know any other team that does this so

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm just can't wait until somebody like

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,920
makes fun of me for like how I've named

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,280
my columns or when we like start to move

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,020
our epics around it's gonna be real fun

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,540
but you can actually go we've started to

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,540
use Zen hub so it's essentially adds a

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,990
layer on top of github projects or like

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,670
github issues and pull requests this is

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,110
what our board looks like right now you

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,030
can actually go see what we're

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,560
prioritizing you can see how we're

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,990
prioritizing the work that we're doing

00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,370
you can actually go issues that you'll

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,620
make and PRS that you'll make will

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,230
actually land in this board and you can

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,720
see how they move across from a backlog

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,240
ticket to it to do to something that's

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,430
in the process interview done and then

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,100
closed off and we're really excited

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,780
about this and sort of sharing this with

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,720
the community you can actually see how

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,210
we're operating day to day and hopefully

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,600
you know it becomes a nice source of

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,490
truth for us being that just radically

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:12,610
transparent with the work that we're

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:15,610
doing awesome so we also have obviously

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,140
open issues and PRS now issues were

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,040
reopened on the CLI which was really

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,950
nice a nice we have this concept of rfcs

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,140
so you can actually you know request a

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:31,330
feature from us from NPM the CLI the

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:33,790
registry if you go to our github org and

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,100
at the very top we have a project called

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,800
RFC's you can actually create a pull

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,240
request and ask or sort of outline a

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,050
feature that you'd like to see us

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,930
implement and going further we've start

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,090
to run open our see calls bi-weekly

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,370
taking sort of the learnings from the

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,860
node foundation the way they operate and

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,960
open Jas foundation and running

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,850
bi-weekly meetings that anybody can join

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,010
we stream them on YouTube

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,110
and you can actually join the zoom calls

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:07,520
so you can see here's some lovely faces

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,020
you can go there's archived I mean I'm

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,970
in the middle of saying something here

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:17,420
Royce that Royce

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,950
you look pretty disinterested but yeah

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,860
this is awesome so if we're creating

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,810
these sort of artifacts about how you

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,300
know how we're operating and why we're

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,220
the we're making decisions and we're

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,010
also hoping that you know you will come

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,800
collaborate with us have discussions

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,990
with us and you're totally enabled to

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,030
come do that where we'd be excited if

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,240
you came and joined us cuz we've got a

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:45,130
number of these calls now on our on our

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,130
YouTube page that are they're backlogged

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:53,420
so as well as we have Doc's that's a

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:57,230
reference to our old Doc's I may or may

00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:00,680
not have a link for you to use to go

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:04,100
check out our net new Doc's you can go

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,220
to preview - Doc's dot MP MJS calm and

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,890
you'll actually see a new experience

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:12,350
we're currently still baking this but it

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,090
is the most up-to-date actual source of

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,900
truth for our Doc's we're gonna give

00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,250
them a nice little rebrand and refresh

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,930
which is awesome and we're hoping this

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,880
is going to really help we're gonna

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,140
include search in this as well with

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,390
something that people have asked for

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,850
years like hey can I search the docs can

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,460
I easily like navigate we know that's

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,100
been tough we're trying to fix that

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,390
so if you get a preview Doc's time pmj

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,070
is calm you can go see this new

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:42,920
experience it's awesome cool we also

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,080
actively up my team actively works very

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,550
closely with the node foundation where

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,080
we're sitting on some of the working

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,300
groups including the package maintenance

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,030
working group and the tooling working

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,520
group so if you're ever like looking

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,720
around and trying to see what we're

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,810
doing in the open source world you'll

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,690
probably find us in those calls so

00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,450
what's next for NPM with some cool stuff

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:09,320
that I can share with you so coming down

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:11,960
the pipeline we have the concept of

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,620
multiple finding entries so Jordan

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,830
Harvin

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,830
who actually works on mbm so who uses

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,760
MDM here lots of folks right it's

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,059
awesome

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,500
which just got recently pulled into the

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:30,170
open Geospatial which is awesome yeah

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,510
Joe so yeah it's awesome

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,760
and he's been helping us he wants to see

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,490
essentially that idea of you know a

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,260
single record for funding turn into you

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,640
know multiple records that can be

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,190
utilized for let's say multiple

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,040
maintainer Zoar let's say maybe patreon

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,960
links or something like that right

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,970
there's a lot of opportunity here and

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,620
we're currently sort of sussing out the

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,540
RFC for it NPM 7 has been on our backlog

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,990
for a long time we're actively working

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,360
on it and we have queued up the concept

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,730
of workspaces which we know people have

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,920
told us for forever you know we have

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,580
workspaces in yarn lerna like we want

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,220
them from NPM it's coming also with the

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,120
refactoring work that we've been doing

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,460
there's a whole bunch of performance

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,410
wins that we've been seeing and it's

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,750
just cleaning up the code we are

00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,960
hopefully going to have NPM seven a

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:26,960
version of NPM seven staged and ready to

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:33,050
be consumed not not ready to be released

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:35,600
fully but in early q1 stage publishes

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,700
and scoped auth tokens are something

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,040
that I'm championing internally right

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:46,250
now so try to sort of sophisticate the

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,420
CI publish workflow for folks and if

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,970
you're interested in this feel free to

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,200
ping me afterwards there's a lot that's

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,110
going into this there's a lot of

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,910
discussion that's going into this and

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,650
the last thing here is package

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,350
exploration and package shipping I'm

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,420
sure you've always wanted this right why

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,940
has this never been a thing on NPM Jess

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:08,300
calm like why the source of truth from

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,520
packages is NPM why do you have to go to

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,010
get up and check out a repo which may or

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,640
may not be the same thing so who would

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:21,470
like a demo of some cool stuff yeah I

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,640
can't hear you no yeah okay sweet so I'm

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:29,200
gonna demo some stuff for you right now

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,920
go as quickly as possible but what I'm

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,590
getting demo is actually live right now

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,400
we pushed yesterday and there were some

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:42,059
folks that I'm not sure if they're here

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,330
no Jason Miller from Google sort of

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,710
undercut me quickly oh and PS I was like

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:52,150
I knew you would want to see a demo so I

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,590
was like nice go so he quickly found

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,270
this and I'm sure if you've already been

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,760
to the website you may have seen it

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,919
already we've been making some edits i'm

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,020
pmj Escom we've been making some

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,870
improvements first of which is some you

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,669
know CSS love which will continue to

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,799
happen the mobile experience right now

00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:10,480
is in great we're gonna continue to make

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,440
that better

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,669
but what you may or may not have seen we

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:23,200
now have a nice new tab on your package

00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:27,220
pages can anybody figure out which one's

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,770
new explore right cool cool you're like

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,820
Darcy come on

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:36,730
Oh low - doesn't work okay actually am I

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,850
logged in so we have a and I'm gonna

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,390
start to show you what row you're giving

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,460
me a hard time

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:47,530
oh yeah okay I react so two things to

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,690
know actually so this is perfect sample

00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:53,410
thank goodness I went to this first

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:56,880
and I told JD D if he's in the audience

00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,220
which is not that would go low - first

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,380
this is very limited beta we haven't

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,960
fully baked this there's lots of

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,030
features that we're gonna be rolling out

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,730
soon but this is definitely something

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,549
that we've heard everybody wants if you

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,919
go to let's say react you can actually

00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:18,730
go around this is limited availability

00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,860
as well so your user count has to be a

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,630
paid teams to get access to this today

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:28,990
although we'll be rolling out to

00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:30,760
everybody in the in the future good know

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,470
it's expanding the tarball this is the

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,230
source of truth which is also why you

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,510
might see this nice little integrity and

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,730
sha some value at the bottom here

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,370
just to let you know this is exactly

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,140
what is in the registry and you can

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,510
click around you can look at you know

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,950
your files and you can be like oh my

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:54,340
goodness lik this is crazy Facebook and

00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:56,800
some really crazy we're gonna look at

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,690
some licensing your stuff what's really

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,390
interesting is oh you get like

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,440
versioning for free so let's go to like

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,450
an old version of this package 611 and

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,740
we go back to the explore page let's

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,650
look at the package.json look at this

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,120
I'm on 611 pretty awesome you'll notice

00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,000
that the install script is also being

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,860
updated so that it actually adds the

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,950
specific version you're looking at so

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,770
you can copy and paste that and quickly

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,030
install that specific version so there's

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,790
all these little tweaks there's all

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:31,120
these amazing things that we are rolling

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:38,200
out from our team from the team at NPM

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:39,730
thank you very much you'll know some

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,680
other other through the sidebar

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,780
everybody was getting tired of seeing

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,490
github everywhere on your package page

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,860
it's like they owned the world right

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,230

expanded the URLs for for repose and and

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,470
home pages this was sort of a pain point

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,900
people we're not you know like this

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,210
didn't look very good we also have now

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,630
bubbled up the unpacked size information

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,970
there we know that there's other

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:16,180
community tools bundle phobia etc that

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,280
provide also this sort of metadata we're

00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,970
we're working on you know giving you a

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:26,670
better experience online here so cool

maybe there's a better yeah I know

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:32,770
whoa man come on you like giving away

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:36,100
the yeah we'll show you one more it is

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:40,020
about good yeah this this one has like

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:44,500
is like super deeply nested like

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,260
information cool so let's go to a

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,450
packaged page that has defined funding

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,010
so my cool little sleepover

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,440
package look at that

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:59,290
look at this new little button right so

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,310
again very similar you know github

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:05,110
sponsors and you know open collective

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,600
there's a million different ways for

00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:10,600
open-source developers now to try to

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,750
make money we wanted a way a mechanism

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,750
again to to make this meaningful so when

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,940
you define that funding fields we now

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,000
will add this button to your package

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,830
page it quickly will as you would guess

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,210
when I click it it's gonna take me to

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:30,310
that that link right and yeah so like

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,130
lots of cool little improvements over

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,750
time we imagine this to you know expand

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,790
when we have multiple funding we're

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,780
gonna have some new capabilities there

00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:44,670
and we options right am I missing

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:48,960
anything now are we good they were good

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:51,670
are you sure we're good well we can I

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,960
don't know is there anything else I

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:58,870
don't know I don't think we're think

00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,450
we're good so that's just a few sorry so

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:06,010
we do have run kit so if you've ever

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,700
liked on to a website or NPM package

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,410
page sorry

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,200
have you seen this little button you

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,460
click on it it takes you to run kit

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,630
which you can actually start to play

00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,470
with let's say the MPM package just so

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,410
you know this is I do have code maybe

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:27,400
sitting on a branch for having this

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:29,320
embed in the actual website itself so

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,140
that may be coming as well so if I say

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:36,400
sleep let's say pulling this guy out I'm

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:39,640
gonna say sleep for two hundred two

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,270
seconds then it will consult log oh and

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,950
you can just this this library sleep

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,740
over essentially is using Atomics weight

00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:50,950
to to halt the execution and then do

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,780
something so this is actually running in

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,580
the browser so yeah this is a sandbox in

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,530
repple in the browser if you've never

00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,160
seen it before so you this is on every

00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,230
package page so kind of fun to be like

00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,310
if you want to try something you can

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:08,060
just click on that button try it out

00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:10,370
it's pretty awesome cool so I think

00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,470
that's about it I think that's all I got

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,360

to see some cool stuff in your free time

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:24,350
if you happen to run NPM Xmas it might

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:26,990
do something but yeah again
