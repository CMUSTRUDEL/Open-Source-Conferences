Express is one of the most influential and important projects in the Node.js ecosystem. In this talk, Wes will share his journey going from a user to a contributor and ultimately to a Technical Committee member. He will share what he learned along the way and share these lessons to help you to better understand how to get involved.

Did you know that "Express" is more than a single module? Wes will introduce the different modules which make up "Express", sharing some of the surprising ways people use these modules outside of Express itself.

Finally, he will touch on what is upcoming in Express 5 & 6, and ways you or your company can use and support the project in the upcoming year.
