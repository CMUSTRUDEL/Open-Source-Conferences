Description: 
	Looking at the Future of Express: Using and Contributing to Express in 2020 - Wes Todd, Netflix
Speakers: Wes Todd
Express is one of the most influential and important projects in the Node.js ecosystem. In this talk, Wes will share his journey going from a user to a contributor and ultimately to a Technical Committee member. He will share what he learned along the way and share these lessons to help you to better understand how to get involved.

Did you know that "Express" is more than a single module? Wes will introduce the different modules which make up "Express", sharing some of the surprising ways people use these modules outside of Express itself.

Finally, he will touch on what is upcoming in Express 5 & 6, and ways you or your company can use and support the project in the upcoming year.

so welcome everyone in my pocket sorry

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,890
getting set up a little bit during the

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,330
time we're running late in this room I

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,780
guess

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,820
so welcome I'm Wes

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,130
I work at Netflix but more importantly I

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,380
have the immense pleasure to work on a

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,460
lot of open-source JavaScript all right

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,010
so that's probably what you're all here

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,210
today to talk about right you don't

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,779
really care about what I do at work you

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,489
wanna know about Express right yeah some

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,030
feedback here here we go okay much

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,500
better much much better okay so to get

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,760
started we're gonna talk about a few

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,870
other projects so does anybody in the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,239
room use fast if I yeah yeah yeah a

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,680
couple not very many Wow okay I thought

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,430
more people would would you specify it's

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,289
a great HTTP web framework so when I

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,910
first got introduced to FASTA Phi I did

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,100
what I often do which you know call me

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,539
crazy but I cracked open the package

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,180
Jason and I started pouring through its

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,000
dependencies you know I'm a read the

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,950
source code kind of person so I was in

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,640
there and I I noticed one that I

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,610
recognized the module proxy adder does

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,770
anybody familiar with what that one does

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:22,590
no no no one man I'm given stumpers so

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,600
proxy adder is a module that will find

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,140
the client IP address from the

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,759
x-forwarded-for header right so y'all

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,009
work on the internet you know you cannot

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,920
trust users on the Internet everyone

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,159
lies right so headers come from a user

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,110
can't trust them so proxy adder goes

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,299
through the process of safely parsing

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,340
the x-forwarded-for header so that your

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,579
application can get an IP address that

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
it trusts right so fast sorry

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,470
I haven't talked too much yet this

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,520
morning so fast if I use is this module

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,259
to get a trusted IP address it parses

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,579
the list loops through them finds the

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:08,009
first untrusted IP address which means

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,629
if you water that's the key okay so if

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,039
you've configured your servers correctly

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:14,330
which obviously you all have because

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,330
you're all stellar engineers right

00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:20,760
then you have put in all of your on

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,560
network IP addresses so as the proxies

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,930
you know the request is proxied through

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,999
your infrastructure when it gets to your

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,499
node server it might have three or four

00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,959
different IP addresses in there

00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:33,989
oh I'm just keeping a head and so I

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,939
better get get fast and then it will

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,560
give you in the application a trusted IP

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,579
address so you might see where I'm going

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,879
with this

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:48,239
who are those modules maintained by the

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,859
Express team right so this is one really

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,629
great example of the way that the

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,549
Express modules are used in the

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,669
ecosystem but there's a ton of other

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,049
ones does anybody use react router yes a

00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,180
lot more okay there we go

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,519
your friend and people aren't you so

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,739
react router uses path to reg X under

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,189
the hood for its route parsing path the

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,099
regex

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:11,480
anybody guess who maintains that express

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,480
team yes of course

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,060
what about web pack right probably

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,359
everybody if you're using ricked router

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:26,009
as well web pack dev server that's

00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:28,939
express also though as a as you can see

00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,349
web pack has quite the dependency tree

00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,389
so in there you will find Express and

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,949
everything that is directly required as

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,949
a dependency or terms of dependency of

00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,439
Express but you also find that serve

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,689
index compression and range parser are

00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,810
in there independently right so the

00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:48,349
reach of these modules that make up the

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,540
that are under the umbrella of Express

00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,489
they go into all of these little areas

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,790
that it takes to run an HTTP server so

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,949
view anybody use view yeah view okay do

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,549
you use it with next next

00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:05,519
same kind of thing their server uses

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,519
compression etag fresh on header serve

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,870
static all Express modules it also uses

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,219
connect which you could say is an

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,289
express module right it's like the

00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:18,000
precursor though and lastly anybody fan

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,000
of Zeit products they make a lot of

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
great stuff yeah okay they have a bunch

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,770
of open source modules one of which is

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,690
serv right as you can guess uses some

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,490
Express modules so you

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,710
uses compression serve handler

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,340
content-disposition mime types and range

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,720
parser right so I've listed off a ton of

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,500
things and I've said over and over who

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:48,750
maintains it the express team but who is

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:50,870
that you might think me you'd only be

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,880
partially right

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:59,960
this person you all know who Doug Wilson

00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:03,300
is know yeah some people he's not a bird

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,760
you will see he is some other inanimate

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,900
objects we'll see in a second so Doug

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,000
back in 2013 was participating in the

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,420
project you all probably are like oh

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,460
yeah TJ right what about TJ well TJ

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,890
famously left the note ecosystem around

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,830
then and a bunch of other people stepped

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,570
in to help foster the project very

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,360
quickly it became clear that Doug was

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,730
both the most prolific and the only one

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,780
who was going to stick around

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,580
effectively a lot of other people sort

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,820
of moved on to other things kind of like

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,070
TJ did so slowly

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,410
Doug became the most prolific maintainer

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,540
in open source would be my guess one of

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,430
the most this is a few years of his

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,990
github graph I went through and then you

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,890
might see a couple of gray spots there

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:57,380
and like I think this is like 2014 to

00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:01,350
2019 14 15 16 17 18 19 right

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,720
very very prolific so this is mostly

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,280
Express and if you look at this you're

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,390
probably thinking how could he possibly

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,610
do this he has a full-time job right I

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:14,370
said the same thing in 2013 well I guess

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,050
maybe was 2014 and and I was looking at

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,610
the project I'm going wow like all the

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,419
all these maintainer czar started moving

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,290
on to other things

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,990
Doug is very committed but also isn't

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:31,350
gonna burn out right like that's this is

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:33,060
a lot of work right well he did okay

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:38,100
I'll get to that a little bit more in a

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:41,510
second so let's talk about myself and

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,810
when I got into the project so around

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,760
time it was 2014 I was a user you know

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,350
hopefully like all of you are I didn't

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:53,270
ask who uses Express I'm just assuming

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:55,190
that you all do and I was looking at the

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,230
project just lightly following the

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,540
github you know just I wasn't super

00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,580
involved but my company was our entire

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,260
app stack was built on top of Express

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,070
right we had a hundred micro services

00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,540
all of them Express and so I said I

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,370
think this is an important project for

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,620
me to follow and to understand you know

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:21,410
what's going on

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:22,370
so then Netflix always actually added

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,140
this slide only because I was getting

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,580
really annoyed with this thing repeating

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,140
over and over as I was working on my

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,430
slides and I'm like something I gotta I

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,430
gotta have something in the middle there

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,530
to break it up I'm skipping ahead okay

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,740
so where's my potato

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,040
there's my potato so I'm getting into

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,290
the project and for a few days the

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,770
primary maintainer of Express was a

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,110
potato he change his profile picture he

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,640
changed his name and it is you can't

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,910
guess potatoes don't type very well

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,100
right so also no commits no work being

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,930
done right it happened the thing I was

00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,810
worried about happened right was the

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,190
primary maintainer was like I can't deal

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,810
with some of this stuff right there's a

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,910
lot of work so that was when I decided

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,500
that I was going to jump in on the

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,030
project so I opened up my oh I think I

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,910
got a missing slide here well I opened

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,610
up my first issue and it was talking

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,260
about the the router being published as

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,940
a separate module and it turned out that

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,040
that aligned really well with what the

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,100
the team was was thinking about for this

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,930
so within like two months the first

00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,140
commit was made on the pillar jeaious

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,960
router module which will be the is and

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,750
will be the router for Express v5 this

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,680
was in 2014 so it's been hanging there

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,260
for quite a while I did that I started

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,120
working on triaging a few issues then

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,480
and this is where I get to this I made

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,150
my first real code contribution so this

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,200
was a silly little thing as you can see

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,250
here it's a single index file license

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,950
readme nothing out

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,870
right this is a polyfill because at the

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,560
time I was running the Express router in

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,860
the browser in ie8 okay so we needed a

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,840
polyfill for this I did it today this

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,450
gets about seventeen point two million

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,860
downloads a week

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,740
stupid little line of code right tiny

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,720
contribution outsized impact on the

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,640
community you don't even need this

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,680
anymore it still ships with it like I

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,750
said seventeen million no you shouldn't

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,900
use this anymore there's you know we've

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,340
moved past this we have object out set

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,990
prototype of right but back then we

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,200
didn't right so we needed something that

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:38,030
was my first code contribution and I

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,190
show that because the impact is huge so

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:45,830
this is a little graph just comparing

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:49,220
and this is downloads per day the

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,400
project and all of the other people in

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,010
the ecosystem right this is a outsized

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,010
impact for the code that we support

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,930
right as an express team so when I was

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,070
doing this I you know I work at Netflix

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,780
now so it's a little bit different but

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,180
back then the code that I wrote could

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,920
reach like a couple thousand people

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,750
right like the work I was doing it was a

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,960
startup we had you know a small user

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:15,380
base when I realized the impact that I

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,670
could have on people via the Express

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,410
project and the code that we were

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,960
shipping with that project it really

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,930
blew my mind it made me like I like open

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,940
my eyes to what open source impact

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,200
really looks like right and this is

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,810
today I think the Downloads were

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,580
probably lower back then because

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,370
javascript is growing and that means

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,380
Express is growing but but still it felt

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,240
like really powerful right like I have

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,210
these tools and I made these like this

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,040
this module was like a couple lines

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,740
right took me less than an hour to write

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,990
and and was reaching you know now my

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,339
code is now running on on millions and

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,370
millions of people's projects so as I

00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,770
went from there you know sort of typical

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:03,850
stories you slowly get more and more

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:06,470
involved in the project and I today and

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,780
one of the I'm the second most prolific

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:12,260
contributor way behind Doug

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,970
right but if you look at it it quite

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,430
quickly drops off so you'll see Linus

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,890
and Blake are both TC members as well

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,040
there's a couple people who just these

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:26,120
contributions is code and comments and

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:30,440
other sort of github activity so so this

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,430
this story is to share a little bit

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:38,870
about my history and why I'm here today

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:43,430
so in 2018 after all of that I wrote

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:49,640
this blog post and and I said Express is

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:52,730
great right but not much has changed in

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,410
the past few years so in 2018 I made the

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,980
argument that this was a good thing

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,980
right and and I still believe that it is

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,010
because the power of Express and the

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,020
ecosystem is that it is stable and you

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,170
know you can build on top of it and run

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,500
a service for the next and we're talking

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,300
Express for lon landing in like 2013 and

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,060
it's still the primary major version

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,760
right you can run a service on top of

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:26,680
Express without a lot of churn it will

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:29,270
be stable that said today if we go back

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,020
not to the potato

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:35,630
I will never close that gap between 76

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:41,870
and 173 and if we go back a little bit

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:47,000
more you'll notice 2019 a little slower

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:49,220
right so I was looking at it going what

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,240
can I do you know to push this project

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,690
forward I had all these open PRS I had a

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,600
lot invested in in being maintainer of

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,339
Express but I was looking at some of the

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,810
the movement on the project and I was

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:07,339
like this is a little slower than I

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,380
would like and I will not become a

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,890
potato I don't have time for that right

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,950
like I've got a job too I'm not like

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,350
Doug is amazing right but I have a

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,290
daughter this is my life I'm that is

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,819
more important right to me then Express

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,639
so I'm looking at this going how

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:28,639
and I helped solve this problem and I

00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,239
learned a lot about so I'm a recent

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,729
father and through having a daughter I I

00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:37,850
really saw this parallel with raising a

00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:41,329
child and having an open-source project

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,309
right so it's a little silly at you know

00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:44,569
at first you're like oh so they're cute

00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,429
I have this little baby I get to take

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,449
care of and and then you realize like

00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:52,220
really it's a person right

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:55,699
open-source is just a bunch of people

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,769
write the code sure but what matters is

00:13:55,699 --> 00:14:02,449
the community and the people behind it

00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:04,789
right so I people are squishy we have

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,579
all these sort of weird things we're

00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,669
trying to solve some hard problems in in

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:12,049
our software right but really I want to

00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:15,139
challenge everybody to think about the

00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:18,079
hardest problem in all of this is a

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:20,749
squishy humans right our little babies

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,189
and and the people who they will become

00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:27,799
right that is really the hard problem so

00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:29,329
the project I really want to focus and

00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,309
this is where we're going finally it's

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,329
how many minutes in halfway through the

00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:35,989
talk and I finally get to the title

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:38,419
slide so looking to the future of

00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,759
Express the next decade what I want it

00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:44,569
to be about is community building right

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,939
I want to have open governance models I

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:48,619
want to have a nice onboarding

00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:52,879
experience for new contributors I don't

00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:54,889
want that drop off from 176 to 76 to 22

00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,249
and that person is just a drive by on a

00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,109
PR right I want to see project growth I

00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:04,339
want to see a community that we can

00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:07,039
rebuild right that existed back in 2012

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:09,529
and 2013 when node was exciting and new

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,079
right but now we have apps to maintain

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:17,739
we have people who depend on our code to

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:21,079
run their products right so to do that I

00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:24,470
want to spend the next atleast year

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,869
really focusing on you all right like

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,369
you're all here I hope he didn't come

00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:31,100
here thinking I was gonna talk too much

00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:34,129
about the technical and the actual code

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,970
and Express so sorry if I'm

00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:38,730
disappointing you in that but I

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,100
that you know we all focus so much on

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,370
that that we can very easily lose sight

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,529
of the impact of our work and the ways

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,660
that getting involved really matters I I

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,100
was laughing at you know I I'm not a

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,870
huge fan of the one plus one equals

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,029
three from the keynote before but I

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,649
think the sentiment is really what I I

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,170
want to spend the rest of the time

00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:00,660
talking about right is how we as a

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,579
community and as a team who use and love

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,930
some of these you know JavaScript

00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:10,339
projects can come together and and

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:14,100
exponentially impact the the community

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:17,069
so and the project so there will be some

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,180
code involved in that right it's not

00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:23,879
just a bunch of comments in github so we

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:27,870
have this if you can see here for 2014

00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:30,000
was when the Express 5pr was opened

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,850
right so we have a lot of code that

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,860
needs to be committed and and push to

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,420
the project what we've done as the

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,600
Technical Committee is we've decided

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,949
that express five needs to be cut we

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,189
need to we need to push that release

00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:46,470
right so a lot of the things on this

00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:48,029
this original list are probably not

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,009
going to make it into the Express five

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:51,240
release so here's where the the

00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,569
technical parts do come in we will be

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,529
shipping promised sketch support which i

00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,660
think is probably the single biggest

00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:01,230
thing that people care about I hope in

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,530
this room HTT be fought to was on this

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:08,069
list and it is being dropped HTTP 3 is

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:12,299
so close in concept that I think we we

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:15,059
didn't want to commit to the next couple

00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:18,539
of years of Express 5 maintenance with

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:22,709
HCP to being sort of an in-between state

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,929
and HTTP 3 but the plan is once we get

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,150
five out we will get six staged and

00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:28,789
ready to go within a year that's my

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,450
commitment try to hold me to it

00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:34,980
and and then from there on you know the

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,710
breaking changes will have happened and

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,750
we will have the path forward for all of

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,150
you to contribute to the project and

00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:45,210
have it really move fast and and for you

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,220
to feel the impact of your work so to do

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,299
that let's now talk about some of the

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,600
community things that we're going to be

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,600
doing

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,850
so we've been working a lot with the

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,310
package maintenance working group which

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,920
is a node core working group and we've

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,830
been talking about how we can build

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,580
programs that help these projects like

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,560
Express but not limited to support the

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,130
work so one of the first things that we

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,930
have done is we have created a status

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:21,990
board so you can go here now so if you

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,280
so I should skip ahead one and and talk

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,380
about why this is important so the

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,980
accept the Express project is broken up

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,440
into three main github organizations so

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,860
I mentioned all of those dependencies

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,840
that these big projects have obviously

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,370
most of those weren't expressed like

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,410
they're not NPM installing Express in

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:46,790
those right so most of those modules

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:50,700
live in either j/s HTTP or pillar j/s so

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:54,450
I'll talk about the three sort of in a

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,290
top-down order so the the main one

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,290
you're all probably familiar with

00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,990
Express Jas right that's where Express

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:04,020
lives so the the modules that are housed

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:07,190
under the Express Jas github org are the

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:10,140
top level things the middle where's the

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,940
you know the the the things that are

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:18,060
really the Express layer below that is

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,800
pillar J s so pillar j s I think the

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:24,390
tagline on the organization is like BYO

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,140
at a byof for something bring your own

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,640
framework the idea is that that is the

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,360
underpinnings that you would need to

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,680
write an Express of your own right so

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,570
Khoa if you're are you all familiar with

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,090
KOA yeah okay

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,810
so when that was that split was being

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:45,780
made koa did build directly on top of a

00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,850
bunch of oh this little videos is a

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,980
little bit slower than I and I was

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:54,570
talking so we're not to the pill urges

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:56,400
yet but so so koa built on top of that

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,470
right so the idea is this is where

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,090
things like path to regex live right

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,900
which is the react router dependency

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,570
that I talked about

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,950
this is where I'd like it to speed up so

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:12,070
we can get the visuals the joys of

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:16,300
having video timings in your talk it's

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,670
probably not a good idea well anyway so

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,350
it's where the the sort of underpinnings

00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,150
the things that you need to construct

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,730
the higher level abstractions that

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:28,630
express either you use when you see

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,190
Express and then below that is j/s HTTP

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,710
and so this is where a lot of those

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,500
things like compression mime types range

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,490
parser are so these are spec compliant

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:44,800
technical implementations for the HTTP

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:46,210
protocol layer right so all that work is

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,059
spread across all of these different

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,170
organizations all these different repos

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:55,030
how would you know where to start

00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:57,970
the status board okay so if you go here

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,000
and go to the project's tab you'll see

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,860
all of the projects with their github

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,510
organ and their name it also it shows a

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,910
bunch of extra information about the

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,820
health of the project things open PR is

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:13,510
open issues if you're interested in

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,429
seeing what areas the express project

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,679
covers this is your jumping off point

00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:21,670
okay so you go there look through the

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:25,420
projects and then sort of my favorite

00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:29,140
feature of this we are taking all of the

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,179
tagged issues and we are showing some of

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:36,460
the most important tags that we use

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:37,900
across all three organizations so maybe

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,670
I don't want to mess with this

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:46,350
fullscreen stuff so we have top

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:50,370
priorities you'll see HTTP two in there

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:53,559
you'll see typescript typing support

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,570
you'll see Express five obviously right

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,080
I think there's a bunch others that need

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:02,500
to go in that list I think we want more

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,570
community feedback on where Xpress five

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,400
and six what features you all really

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,929
care about and and those would be the

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,610
things will will tag is top priority

00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,679
those ones might be a little bit

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,110
difficult if you're not super familiar

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,760
with the project right so we also have

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,880
Help Wanted

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,100
good first issue and discussion tags so

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,200
those are a lot better places for you to

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,140
go if you're if you're just trying to do

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,340
what I did in 2014 which is browse I'm

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,450
not sure if I can contribute here yet I

00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,160
don't even know why I would like what

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,380
are the modules that that that I might

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,800
use in my day to day work that I that I

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,400
should care about you know how do I even

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,950
discover those so if you go into the

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,820
there's also a section see I should have

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:52,630
had this that's the video problem anyway

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:58,180
I you'll see it if we wait long enough

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:59,890
on this video so so that's a great place

00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,880
to get started but then we were talking

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,140
with the package maitenance working

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,310
group and we're like well okay that you

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,680
know this helps like this at least

00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:11,920
centralizes a lot of the information for

00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:13,600
people but look at all those open issues

00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,430
you know these top ones don't really

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,870
show but open pairs and open issues

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,760
there's hundreds and hundreds and

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,980
hundreds right and people are opening

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,110
new ones all the time and to maintain

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,710
errs are not enough to to really answer

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,030
all of that right so we were talking in

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,400
the package mains for working group

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,590
about what we could do to help with that

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,770
so this is the second program that we're

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,560
working on Jewish my partner in crime

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,320
here front row has been working on this

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,110
with us thank you very much so this is a

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,660
triage role which we're starting to roll

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,940
out across all three organizations so

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:53,770
this is sort of your on-ramp to the

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,360
project right we have this is an example

00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:59,080
of requesting access so we have a

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,200
process now for for joining if you are

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,880
interested in this the impact that I was

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,650
talking about earlier but you really

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,750
just don't have that maybe the time to

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,460
fully commit yet you just want to you

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,200
know be around but you'd love to have

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,040
that like Express logo on your github

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,500
page right for this Louie all right and

00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,500
and some extra little green green dots

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,790
and stuff but really the the you know

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,350
that's obviously the vanity stuff we I

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,830
want to talk about the impact that this

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,890
role will have on the team so the reason

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:30,450
why we

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,950
this is the one of the best places to

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,420
start is because this is what Doug and I

00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,760
spend like most of our time on is

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,710
answering people's questions right and

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,420
when we do that we're not pushing code

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,240
we're not pushing new releases right

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,890
we're we're doing the the squishy work

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,910
right which is amazing work and an

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,530
invaluable to the project but it means

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,750
that the Technical Committee members

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,360
sometimes aren't doing as much coding as

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,280
we would like to push the feature set

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,679
forward so this is really the way that

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,850
you can enable the rest of the team and

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:05,070
all the people to to focus more on that

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,860
that pushing code so to follow up here

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,980
after the talk dress and I will be

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,260
running a little hands-on workshop which

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,270
we will be signing people up for this so

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,220
if you want to come it will be f me

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,710
behind the microsoft booth in the

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,049
sponsors area we're gonna like I'm gonna

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,970
be like merge and pr's and like adding

00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:27,510
you to two organizations like on the

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,070
spot so come and join us for that that

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,929
will be really exciting you know

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:34,380
hopefully we can get at least a couple

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:36,000
of active trousers if you all came and

00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,590
signed up it would just change the

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,570
trajectory of the entire community of

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,220
the project so I might not be able to

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,799
merge all your pull requests like like

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:48,780
over there but but I promise we will get

00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:50,640
to them also just to mention here and

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,730
we'll get links to all of this

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,350
this ref PR 4055 there's some we added

00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,760
some guidelines and some instructions on

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,380
how to get started

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,370
so we'll go over those a little bit in

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,660
the you know over in the other area so

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,460
you're not you won't be alone and it

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,320
won't be just like dumping you in and

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,429
saying good luck like we did to dress

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,990
originally but you know we'll we'll have

00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:17,580
this and then the goal would be that we

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,950
can take some of this that we've worked

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,179
on and Express and and up level it to

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,010
the package maintance working group and

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,290
provide some structure for other

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,809
projects in the ecosystem that might

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:32,150
benefit from our experience running such

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:34,230
a large a large ecosystem of modules and

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:39,900
the time where I sell out just a little

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:42,840
bit so Express is not funded Doug and I

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,000
volunteer our times I

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,340
I don't want to make money off Express I

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,070
have a wonderful job at Netflix but I

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,740
want money for the project so we can do

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,080
awesome things redesign the logo right

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,970
can't you like like fast if I has an

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,790
awesome logo and then it's like more

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,500
Express is like so old feeling right

00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,620
something like that where we can't do it

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,080
without some some finances you know

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,870
things like stickers I'm gonna I have a

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,820
bunch of Netflix occurs where's the

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,130
Express sticker Wow

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,930
right so oh well that was not a good

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:21,210
idea whatever I just touched it well

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,100
good thing we were toward the end of the

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:27,780
talk and this last slide was like thank

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:29,940
you so that being said please we would

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,370
love to have you on the project the next

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,950
decade for express is really about you

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,770
all coming and joining the project right

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,450
you you can be users you can be triage

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,370
errs you can be technical committee

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,130
members it only takes a little bit of

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,200
work like four years right but you can
