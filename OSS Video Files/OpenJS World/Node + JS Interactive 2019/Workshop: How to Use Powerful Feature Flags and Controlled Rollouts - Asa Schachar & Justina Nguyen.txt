	Workshop: How to Use Powerful Feature Flags and Controlled Rollouts - Asa Schachar & Justina Nguyen, Optimizely
Speakers: Justina Nguyen, Asa Schachar
We'll focus on the beginning of the product experimentation journey -- feature management and feature rollouts. When used strategically and thoughtfully, feature flags can be powerful tools in mitigating risk in your development cycle. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release â€” but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags?

In this hands-on technical workshop, attendees will learn how to strategically create feature flags in multiple development environments and roll them out to a subset of their customers. We'll talk briefly about the possibilities feature flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system.
