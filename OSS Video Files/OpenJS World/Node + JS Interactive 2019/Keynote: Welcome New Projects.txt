00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,670
the web a more beautiful and musical

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,700
place welcome welcome welcome we are so

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,250
excited to have your communities you

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,610
know here with us at the event today and

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,980
to be joining your communities and you

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,550
know I think what we were hoping to talk

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,250
about in our fireside chat which is

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,900
conspicuously absent a fire there's no

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,320
fire so sorry

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,659
we oversold that is sort of kind of what

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,299
brought you here Brett what brought your

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,670
projects here to the point when you when

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,560
did you start to feel it was time for

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,950
your respective communities to maybe

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,540
think about joining a foundation yeah so

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,530
for electron early this year we

00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,960
formalized kind of a governance

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,509
structure for electron and it was really

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,040
at that point that we began to explore

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,759
the idea of joining a foundation of kind

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,689
of in some ways moving on from our

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,710
corporate founding to to really be

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,930
independent yeah I think for us when I

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,240
joined the amp project a couple of years

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,460
ago there was a lot of discussion then

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,170
about how implement source project but

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,420
it wasn't as open as it really could be

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,649
and Google divest of the work and there

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,060
was a strong desire to make it more of a

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,100
thing for the web because that was the

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,829
idea of amp as a thing not for Google

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,300
before the web originally so last year

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,680
they took steps to have a

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,570
kind of governance model that was

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,160
outside of Google that involved various

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,260
people taking care of amp who aren't

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,240
just Googlers and then the desire was to

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,520
get to be was most as open source as

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,050
possible and this is how we came to open

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,240
jana and your communities are pretty big

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,580
communities today right i mean there's a

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,700
big projects that we're talking about

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,010
and they've been stewarding the projects

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,960
fairly successfully for a few years now

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,960
right amps four years old electrons

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,740
young but they're theirs they're quite

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,380
big and what does it mean to your

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,470
communities and what does it signal to

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,940
them you know move like this into into

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,740
the foundation to make this kind of

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,860
change you know I think for electron the

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,430
thing that we really wanted to relay is

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,720
that it's not just like this corporate

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,330
project II it came out of github

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,240
you know github had been acquired by

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,900
Microsoft and so there was some kind of

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,620
it there's some perception of like wow

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,610
okay is Microsoft gonna ruin electron or

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,980
and I don't think that's based in

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,940
reality but but the the reality of the

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,220
electron project is we work across many

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,060
different companies with individual

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:43,170
contributors and joining a foundation

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:47,060
really helps us stay true to that that

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,890
goal of being independent of not being

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,780
you know kind of at the whims of a

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,459
corporation or of of kind of the those

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,160
type of business needs but but really

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,860
being a community project because that's

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,320
what it is I think there are goals that

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,530
are pretty similar I'll be familiar to

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,880
me yeah I mean one person started

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,950
writing out by himself an app was

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,820
created by one person and then many

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,820
folks were working on an app all

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,560
together mostly from Google and expanded

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,030
beyond Google and we thought the time

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
had come to just have everybody really

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,109
make amp together and to make sure that

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,819
we're really being honest value

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,159
being open-source make things as open as

00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,900
possible also to expand the

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,669
contributions again further beyond

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,860
Google and the decision-making process

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,419
also beyond Google also Google for

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,030
example part of amp is there's an app

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,310
cache a couple out there actually the

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,750
most well-known is google's amp cache we

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,789
have this domain we have a lot of

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,550
servers out there that serve pages and

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:45,960
it's important that that be done in a

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,520
way also that's open and that the

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,469
foundation really control these things

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,569
actually work is that if google tried to

00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:54,180
use it for its own business goals some

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,099
point down the future it's kind of both

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,770
you seem to be kind of drawing on this

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,930
theme of like open means more than just

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,090
like technical openness but also of the

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,039
governance itself and sort of the story

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,099
of you know i wonder if you can maybe

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,440
tell a little bit more of that that that

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,900
story of opening up the decision-making

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,900
as you put it for the projects which

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,779
will make things as people working at

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,490
Google we think people want will go out

00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,870
there and ask people what kinds of

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,270
features they need and try to find

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,669
problems get ups full of future requests

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,319
my job in fines involve on developers

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,419
out there finding gaps in the product

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,440
filling those gaps but truly everyone

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,000
should have a chance to do what they

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,500
want to do with amp it should be a thing

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,539
which is good for the web and makes the

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,400
web faster makes this tool better for

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,110
more people and more people have a say

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,190
in how it actually runs and who actually

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,589
makes it it'll be a better product I

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,940
think that that's a important part of it

00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,650
right like that feedback into the

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,919
product because you're getting you know

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,020
more people feel more comfortable giving

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,139
input into it and kind of guiding it so

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,699
they get more feedback on the product

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:06,089
have you seen that played out with

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,759
electron yeah I mean I think we've

00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:13,409
always had that heart of being open of

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,389
always you know valuing an individual

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:19,199
contributor just as much as a corporate

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:21,750
contributor so I think for us it's just

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,039
really reflecting the values we already

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,860
had and and so like just us moving to

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,089
like this open governance model was just

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,110
an expression

00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,850
of the kind of tenants of what we're

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,670
already doing

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,200
so it it's it's just you know I kind of

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,420
consider Lee joined the foundation like

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,940
just another step of like publicly

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,740
recognizing like this is an open project

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,270
and we really want it to be run that way

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm so glad you mentioned like the

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,380
values because both of your projects

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,630
have really great core values which was

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,610
something that we looked at and and part

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,560
of that application process is like okay

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,650
do their values match the open Jazz

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,810
foundation values and I'd love for you

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,410
to share those today with our with our

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,640
community because they are pretty great

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,620
do you want to share a little bit about

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,760
the the vision and the mission for amp

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,380
and electron respectively yeah I guess

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,660
the vision for amp has always been to

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,860
make a better web and people that made

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,120
them from the beginning that was our

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,070
idea it's making it easier to make

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,660
faster websites people could use across

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,220
the world more easily if you're on a

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,990
slower connection or a slower phone

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,760
somewhere else you just let use web

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,720
sites it was to work great for you and

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,730
things we're not the slower than they

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,750
had to be in order for them to work so

00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,850
that's been part of it from the

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,260
beginning and also I guess they include

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,030
the inclusiveness I was saying

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,370
inclusionary before it's not really a

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:49,920
word is it we can make it was part of

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,960
the project designed for accessibility

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,910
for all people and then this should also

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,710
be part of the way that it's created as

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,390
well so amp tries to bring in people

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,330
from all over the world to help out with

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,220
making app better and with the open you

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,320
know open jazz involvement open Jeff's

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,450
incubation process I should just get

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:12,600
better yeah and I think from electrons

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,630
perspective you know our I guess our

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,330
vision would be to allow developers to

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,830
build desktop application it's using web

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:25,440
technologies and for us like from a like

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,080
values perspective inclusivity is is

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,080
really important one of the things that

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,000
I was really impressed with as well was

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,300
as we're kind of going through the

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,860
process of joining there were different

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:45,180
questions and and one of the questions

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:47,880
was would you accept the open Jas COC

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,170
code of conduct and the great thing was

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,730
we looked at it and it

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,209
was basically the code of conduct that

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,810
we were already following so it you know

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,450
just was kind of a perfect alignment of

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:04,470
you know the values that we had as as a

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,839
group and and both electron and amp are

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,790
in this incubation phase which means

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,769
that they're in the process of

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,209
transitioning just not like something

00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,550
that we could just snap our fingers and

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,699
everything is done so actually a lot of

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,440
work isn't it so this is a period where

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:21,329
we're making that transition what has

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,459
this process been like for your projects

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,459
so far you know what's it been like

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,180
working through some of these things

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:33,029
that we have to check boxes we have to

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,620
you know I I was actually expecting it

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,310
to be a lot more difficult

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,160
uh-huh and it actually has been a really

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:44,459
easy process everyone along the way has

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,160
been really helpful at different parts

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,730
we've had different questions about we

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,699
you know are we able to do X or Y you

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,100
know kind of how much freedom would we

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:59,190
have in the project I know it was a kind

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,720
of reoccurring theme and just along the

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,839
way we're just able to have very helpful

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,709
conversations and and kind of work out

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,769
things and figure out you know if there

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:13,649
are things we needed to adjust or just

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:17,310
to kind of really make sure everyone had

00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:20,279
a really good understanding of the

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,750
intention of where we're heading you

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,720
know everyone was really easy to work

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:28,079
with and really responsive and yeah it's

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,730
it's been a great process yeah same here

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,560
it's been pretty smooth I feel like so

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,149
far they've been some questions things

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,920
are trying to align the code of codes of

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,540
to align the codes of conduct properly

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,279
and to make sure contributors can

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,110
contribute more easily with your

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,060
guidelines not the current Google

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,279
guidelines which were kind of annoying

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,170
anyway it's good to have these things I

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,959
think it's good for us to be to be

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,130
honest about all of these things too but

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,720
the nice thing is people here have been

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,860
very nice and easy to work with it's

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,449
been like what kind of already on the

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,300
same side with the same goals to begin

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,750
with so it's just been a nice and smooth

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,750
process

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,059
I think you know you touched on a theme

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,879
that

00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:05,409
sometimes is kind of a question when you

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,809
think about making a change it's like oh

00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,909
maybe a fear of a loss of control a

00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:12,369
little bit or like what am I giving

00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:16,559
something up but you know it doesn't

00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:18,939
sound like are you giving anything

00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,349
people want to have things the one I

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,879
have control over certain things about

00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:23,709
the process of what gets prioritized

00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,479
there'll be things like giving over our

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,859
brand you know these things we made

00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,839
ourselves giving them to somebody else

00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:33,569
but it's just for the better of the

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:35,979
project giving it to the community now

00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,799
something we're going to share and it's

00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:40,539
also seems like it's a nice you know

00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,449
process to go through just to sort of

00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:45,849
like do some project housekeeping right

00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:48,639
as we look at you know the policies that

00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:50,409
you will adopt as an open Jas Foundation

00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,449
project like though it's just sort of a

00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:55,899
nice thing to review from time to time I

00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:57,459
would guess we do things the Potomac

00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,679
things open have meetings that people

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,359
can all access via you know video

00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,099
conference or come to in-person and

00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:04,329
things like that they're just making us

00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,769
be really honest about all these things

00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,909
and finding finding places where we're

00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:08,379
not being as open moved it could be

00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,549
whether they're still click that are

00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,949
involved and do certain things because

00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:12,939
people know each other in certain ways

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:16,049
opening things those things up to

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:19,299
everybody and a more transparent fashion

00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:22,269
so you know one question people might

00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:24,849
ask is like you know openness yay but

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:27,519
why really do I do this what are the

00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:31,419
benefits of making a transition like

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,919
this what are the benefits of joining a

00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,529
software foundation when you think about

00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:39,159
it from a more abstract perspective why

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:41,199
consider it so the one thing that I I

00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,429
think is really important is longevity

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:47,249
of the project like you know people kind

00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:50,409
of talked about this bus factor like

00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,909
electrons kind of a big project so a lot

00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:55,239
of people would have to get hit by a lot

00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:59,379
of buses and order but but you don't

00:12:55,239 --> 00:13:02,379
know over time you know as like most of

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,619
us work for bigger companies that have

00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:07,659
budgets to contribute to the project

00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:10,749
over time you you you can't say whether

00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:13,479
or not that will be there so I think the

00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:15,040
idea of moving to a foundation like as

00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:18,070
long as the project is useful

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,070
like there's a home for it and and I

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:25,120
think being able to have that is is

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,079
really good reason I also think about so

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,089
I I don't know how it was at Google but

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,529
you know it at github when we started

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,829
the project like there wasn't always

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,920
like good corporate support around that

00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:42,639
there was some but like you know just

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:46,449
even things like marketing like like you

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,610
know I think everyone on the project our

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:51,009
day-to-day work odors were not marketers

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,310
so so I think having like marketing

00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:56,050
support and even things like legal like

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,699
if there's like a trademark issue like

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,420
you know that's not really something

00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:04,180
that I want to have to deal with so I

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,850
it's things like that that I find are

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,870
important and and I think it also adds

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,690
some legitimacy to the project of listen

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,389
like it's backed by something but it's

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,990
not again it's not like just a

00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:22,569
corporation or you know some large

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,510
entity it's it's a foundation that is

00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:28,920
there to care for these projects to to

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,449
sustain them all those points there

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,889
you're talking about about corporate

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,449
support I mean Google has been very it's

00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,519
part of amp and still very supportive of

00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,959
amp but it's important that it be part

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,639
of something which is larger than Google

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,750
that goes beyond Google we were

00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,850
discussing before the importance of

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,139
maintaining bility and people think

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,360
maintaining our project is kind of

00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,220
mundane work making new things it's

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,230
exciting considering things we already

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,519
use is not quite as glamorous but of

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,290
course maintaining things is important

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,550
then they work for longer the tools are

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,930
useful for a little while

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,750
they're probably there for a good reason

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,510
it can be used for longer than that so

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,130
it's nice to have sort of more of the

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,630
open community support involved in

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,579
maintenance also we're just kind of

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,800
proud to be part of this family I mean

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,420
node is here all kinds of interesting

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,279
things are good we use every day and

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,410
we're just very honored to be part of

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,149
that group of products I'm really glad

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,769
that you brought up like the the glamour

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,740
of maintenance because like you know

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:23,290
that's what we want to promote because

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,970
you know that's that's we're here to

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,310
maintain the communities that maintain

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,759
the projects and support that's

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:33,850
love that and one one question that I

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,709
want to know is you know why ultimately

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,569
when you were looking at different third

00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:40,480
places as I like to call them for your

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:42,850
for your software work what ultimately

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,439
helped you choose like the open J's

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,930
foundation commune you mentioned node so

00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,470
I mean obviously JavaScript its kind of

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,470
related

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,879
yeah but why why open Jass one nice

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,769
thing about this the organization is

00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,300
that has really crossed cross

00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,610
I guess product is the wrong word cross

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,170
project I guess this various projects

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,850
here we found that there are certain

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,740
orbits organizations that more about

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,939
taking the corporate open source

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,620
projects goes up and source really

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,139
because the goal was to kind of onboard

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,149
developers into certain ecosystem or to

00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,519
get a company a certain amount of cachet

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,199
and the community and this was more

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,809
about really having at home for

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,490
different kinds of useful projects that

00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,410
really appealed to us cause the people

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,069
seemed like there were nice people truth

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,720
so there's been no nasty surprises like

00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:27,720
dying people were all me or something

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:37,809
yeah I mean I think it's we look at the

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:41,980
community I mean our our users are Jaya

00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:46,689
stoves and so to be part of a an

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:48,309
organization you know that is about

00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:51,430
javascript like that's that's really

00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:54,180
important coming alongside node which is

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,089
very important part of electron like we

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:02,199
it it kind of makes sense to to kind of

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:05,049
partner together there I personally have

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,079
my own personal bias in bringing another

00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:10,030
project hospital run - what was the J's

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,959
foundation but but now part of open

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:18,189
jeaious and so I think it was kind of a

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,500
natural selection of just everything

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,839
seemed to kind of line up to what we

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,890
wanted to do and hospital run you

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,600
brought up hospital run is a much

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,250
different type of project but still you

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,669
know an important and interesting

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,220
project wish that the new maintainer

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:38,320
could be here today he's awesome you

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,179
know this being like the second project

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,929
that you've what you've brought I think

00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,480
you've

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,860
probably could look at it from projects

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,619
of different sizes what's different

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:52,149
about the hospital run versus electron

00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:57,990
here yeah so electron certainly is a

00:17:52,149 --> 00:18:01,210
more mature and larger project and

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:08,110
hospital run was kind of me and a couple

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:10,570
other developers and so it was kind of

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,950
in a different state but it was also

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,210
something that needed care to it that

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,169
there was a lot of work that had been

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:25,240
put into it and that work is continuing

00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:29,830
with with a new maintainer and so again

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,779
kind of longevity of the project for

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,639
both electron and and hospital run late

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:37,149
late like I think they're similar goals

00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:40,409
there I think that the difference and

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,190
and one thing that I would encourage

00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,809
projects who are thinking of like

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,320
joining a foundation and thinking about

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:50,259
is is things like governance because if

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,470
you already have that in place that kind

00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:57,090
of makes the transition easier because

00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:00,429
you you already have like a structure to

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,980
to kind of run the project which I think

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,470
makes it easier now I think maybe -

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,720
that's a scale thing right like in a

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,539
project like hospital run governance

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,909
would have been like me and like two or

00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:17,169
three other people sitting in a room

00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:18,369
governance at electron scale is try

00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,820
remember it's like five or six different

00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:24,039
working groups each with like five to

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,990
eight people on it so it's a lot larger

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:34,059
scale but I I think you know in in both

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:36,340
cases they can be served by you know by

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,769
the foundation so you know large project

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,740
small projects I think both have a place

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:43,960
and yeah you know one thing that

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,269
recently mentioned Hospital run has a

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,419
new maintainer but because it was part

00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,919
of our family of projects you know even

00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,330
though it was a small it is a small

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,100
proud

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,320
we were able to help with that sort of

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,690
succession planning right and and that's

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,030
a big function of governance is like

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,200
people are gonna come in and then

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,810
they're gonna you know they're gonna

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,940
move on other things which is great but

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,350
you don't want it yet the project

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,270
especially something as important as

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,570
hospital run is and to some of those

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:15,420
communities to just fall away yep so

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,460
yeah it's a good point for us to with

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,800
amp because you know amp is made by

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,020
again a lot like Google now other folks

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,280
also by Google and people that use them

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,690
out there there's many many sites that

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,150
use amp wanna know it'll still be there

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,850
in five years six years and this helps

00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:33,510
guarantee that for them yeah long term

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,920
maintain Wally so um we're nearing the

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,320
end of our time but I'm I'm really

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,970
curious to know I'm excited about the

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,340
future of open jeaious and all of our

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,130
projects but what are you most looking

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,530
forward to and you know in the new year

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:51,840
as an open James Foundation project I'm

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:54,930
hoping we're gonna get better swag now I

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,620
I think the electron project is really

00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:00,480
looking forward to more collaboration

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,590
with with other projects but especially

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,730
with node but also just to be more

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:13,260
ingrained in into the JSC Co system to

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:17,130
really like not only like gain benefit

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:21,620
but but to be giving help where we can

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:25,110
and in other projects or just to be a

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,370
good member of the community I think

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,990
that's that that's something that's

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,000
important to us is to not just think

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,550
about what we're doing but kind of that

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,910
that whole ecosystem and and how we can

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,560
be helping yeah I'm looking forward to

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,090
more people out there feeling more

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,250
ownership with amp like they can

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,050
actually not just say am plexus feature

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,460
that I want I'll try to like make a

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,840
feature request and see what happens in

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,910
six months back she's saying oh I am

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,340
plexus feature that I want I could make

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,530
this feature because I also am part of

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,610
him that would be a very nice thing

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,650
there are those who are doing this now

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,460
people don't often do this but they can

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,170
do it more and also swag hexagonal

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,500
stickers are great

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,810
and also beyond that that we run events

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,380
around the world we have conferences and

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,880
mini conferences all over the place from

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,310
Pakistan to Brazil to Australia

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,920
everywhere and trying to maybe involve

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,750
all you in more of that a little more we

00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,130
could have events that would be for

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,600
developer tools in general for

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,550
developers to come to JavaScript

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,690
developers to learn more about more

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,880
things they can do to make their lives

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,910
easier and make their websites look and

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,410
look better and be easier to make that's

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,700
awesome I feel you must have been

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,130
reading my mind because like oh we

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,080
should definitely close with a call to

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,810
action here that both electron has

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,820
electron has a collaborator summit and

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,220
post collaborator summit we are doing

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,040
the open Jays Foundation collaborator

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,040
summit tomorrow and Saturday right here

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,450
summit for for Evy there's either of

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,680
these projects because this open source

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:06,390
is your open source it's our open source

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,610
so great I don't thank both of you for
