	00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,919
good morning Bonjour

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,450
comment allez-vous my I took some French

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,660
in school but it's not so great so I

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:18,260
will probably keep it to a minimum will

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,880
not be seen okay so yeah Jim Appel

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,269
Giuseppe I see a lot of familiar faces

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,460
out there but if you don't know me I'm a

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,970
open source engineer at a little company

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,500
called

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,890
IBM and by little I mean like super huge

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,050
and also we do a lot of open source

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,879
which not a lot of people know but I

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,110
take the opportunity to mention any

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,910
chance I get

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,469
in fact some people say we do the most

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,329
open source but you know these are

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:52,170
opinions but I get the great opportunity

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,690
to do lots of work in the community and

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,870
in the foundation and an open source

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,030
overall and I'm currently the

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,260
chairperson of the cross budget Council

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,590
as Robin mentioned and it's been

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,260
exciting since the announcement of the

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,560
intent to merge last year at let the

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,570
last node plus jeaious interactive and

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,350
we've been working tirelessly on on

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,020
bootstrapping

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,299
the foundation and getting the cross

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,310
project council the CPC up and running

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,549
and things started to get you know

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,820
really exciting and with that merger we

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,070
brought in collectively 30 some-odd

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,659
projects I was looking last night trying

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,280
to find like a page that had all of our

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,590
projects in a nice grid I couldn't find

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,900
one so I went to our slack and this is

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,630
the best I could find but it is not at

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,020
all accurate so don't don't quote me on

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,610
that that's not the gospel but I will

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,390
take this moment actually to mention

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,259
open JSF dot org slash collaborate you

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,689
can get on our slack channel or select

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:01,170
instance and see our calendar and all

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:06,600
sorts of ways to get more involved so

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,920
yeah and with that excitement as we've

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,220
been ramping things up

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,599
we've had some a lot lots of interest in

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,760
the foundation

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,190
we now have one one home for for

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,250
JavaScript related projects in the

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:24,330
community you know under a foundation

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,040
and so the the first project as Robin

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,849
had mentioned earlier we we are super

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:33,390
excited about nvm joining and then amp

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,580
followed after that and FASTA fire which

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,319
is really exciting and then the huge

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,180
announcement this morning which is which

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,780
is really super duper exciting is

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,510
electron joining right so boom right

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,750
we've got lots of progress lots of

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:54,599
excitement things are going well let me

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:57,360
get so how many projects do we want to

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,700
to to to scale up to you you know these

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,610
things are exciting times progress and

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,140
growth how big do we want to get and

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,489
it's an interesting question one that I

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,230
don't think we really have an answer for

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,489
and I think the main thing is to just

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,370
figure out how to scale what we're doing

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,880
in a thoughtful and considerate way that

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,370
that's you know the ideas and the plans

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,440
that we want to execute for our projects

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,280
and for our community that we can do

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,590
them well and succeed there but how many

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,450
projects right so this is maybe not a

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,160
fair comparison this is a screen grab

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,859
from the Apache foundation they have

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,350
like over 300 projects I think but

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,239
they've been around for a while so maybe

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,079
somebody who's a little bit newer this

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,239
is the cloud native computing

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:49,620
foundations project landscape they have

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,000
a lot of projects like I think we may

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,359
need begin to figure out how many

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,069
projects they have so we don't you know

00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,530
I don't know that's not really in our

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,079
future at least the near future but we

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,989
are growing and there's lots of interest

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,349
so perhaps perhaps you're involved in a

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,700
project that's considering you know the

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,430
benefits that it may get from a

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,040
foundation and and the benefits that I

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,220
can bring to a foundation so perhaps

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,560
you're thinking about what makes you

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,269
know a good a good fit for a foundation

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,699
whether ours

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:29,330
or others so the good news is that we do

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:33,169
all of our work in in the open and we

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,620
have lots of documentation on online in

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:40,060
our in our github repo it's a slash

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,259
github slash open JSF slash

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,780
cross-project Council anyway you'll

00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,000
you'll find it but there's lots of stuff

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,830
in there including our new project

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,169
application which I've got some snippets

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,909
from here you can get a little bit of

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,380
guidance about some things to be

00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:59,780
considering like alignment with the

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,729
Foundation impact and governance and

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,810
stuff so let's let's maybe dig into a

00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:08,479
couple of those so I suggest if you're

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,490
interested to kind of read through the

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,159
documentation there and and kind of get

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,719
a feel for the foundation and the work

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,479
that the cross project Council is doing

00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:21,379
and you know see how your project may

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:24,020
align with that and then also some

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:27,590
things to consider are like the the

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,130
impact in the ecosystem of the project

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,300
that you're involved in who are using it

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,930
who is using it what what are the

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,880
potential long-term adoption on how it

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,150
may differ and contrast with other

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,460
projects and then something that's

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,060
that's really important to to us that

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,830
the the foundation is open governance

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,810
and you know so the question you may ask

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,180
yourself is what is your leadership team

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,960
looks like it looked like how are they

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,509
elected how our individuals outside of

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,479
leadership team given access to the

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:10,190
project things along those lines that

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:14,960
are you know good open governance points

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,779
and then also how your project measures

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,659
up to what we've kind of collectively

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:23,650
agreed upon that are good standards in

00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:28,490
place for having a welcome and opening

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:30,189
open project to be involved in so you

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,199
know code of conduct

00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,199
governance documentation and and like

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,239
contribution guidelines and I'll have a

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,999
quick shout out to github who's done

00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:43,929
really great work at outlining like

00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:46,449
what's you know good aspects of projects

00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:48,639
that are welcoming and good spaces to

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:55,629
get involved in which is really super

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:58,539
important so a couple other points to

00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:00,189
consider is you know what is your

00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,699
maintainer community like and I

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:05,649
mentioned this because you know if

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,330
you're looking to grow that to like

00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,069
really ramp up your maintainer community

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,269
going to the Foundation's not the

00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,219
greatest idea you want to kind of

00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,719
cultivate that first and then let the

00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:17,800
foundation help you organically grow

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,719
that like what what's what's the pulse

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,649
of the project what's the health of your

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,719
project what are what are the goals and

00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:29,769
how do they align with the foundation

00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:31,300
and what sort of overlap and and synergy

00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:36,819
for lack of a better word do you have

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,740
with other projects in the foundation so

00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,749
yeah you know I don't I don't have a

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,849
summary slide per se but I just wanted

00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:44,319
to encourage you to consider this and

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,059
the work that you're doing or projects

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,129
that you may be involved in and also

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:50,349
take this opportunity to encourage you

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,939
to look at the work that we're doing in

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,539
the foundation like I said everything's

00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:59,709
online you can find our calendar at that

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,509
open JSF org slash collaborate we do all

00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,729
of our meetings or live streamed all of

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:06,099
our meeting notes RP art and it's a

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,749
github a lot of the magic is in the

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,279
issues and the pull requests and it's

00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:12,369
really kind of exciting to just you know

00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,319
get involved there there's very low

00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,659
barrier to entry and we encourage folks

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,189
to attend the meetings and really kind

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,990
of just dig in so you know feel free to

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,669
come and talk to me or anyone else at

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,610
the foundation or anyone else in the in

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,409
the projects as Robin said earlier and

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,749
actually was going to name my my talk

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,069
this so it's kind of funny that she had

00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:35,199
the slide up there but one plus one

00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,570
equals three right the more we work

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:40,169
together

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,870
the better that we do and yeah feel free

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:46,250
to connect with me I hope to be seeing

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,670
you that's my Twitter my DMS are open

I want one other plug Joey and I have a

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,010
talk on day two about the work that

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,589
we've been doing in the cross project

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,440
Council and kind of digging in to the

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:04,199
nitty gritty there and we will have like

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,970
an open office hours after that talk so

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,160

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,360
engage with us and find out you know

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,740
