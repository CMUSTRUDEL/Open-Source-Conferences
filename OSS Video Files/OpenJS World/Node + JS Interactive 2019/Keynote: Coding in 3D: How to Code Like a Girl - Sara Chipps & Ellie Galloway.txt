alright I'm here to waste your time for

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,870
a few minutes the four I introduce to

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,969
you the real star and so my name is

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,630
Sarah I work in a company called

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,180
stackoverflow if you've ever heard of it

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,560
my favorite band is Hanson and my

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,970
favorite color is royal blue I knew

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,439
those really important to all of you

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,539
here so I'm gonna be talking today a

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,460
little bit about my story some

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,800
information about why it's important for

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,719
kids to code an introduction to what we

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,430
do at jewel bots and then I'm handing

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,530
off this talk to the real star of the

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,680
show okay so I am part of the generation

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,940
of folks that became coders because we

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,420
didn't have friends when we were little

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,379
so I was 11 when I started coding in the

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,969
early 90s I started doing it I was a

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,890
home school kid and I found out that you

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,090
could make friends through your computer

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,180
and I thought that would be really fun

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,190
um I went to high school and I took a

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,439
C++ class and I was like this is really

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,869
neat I think like this I want to do this

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,850
always and then I ended up studying

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,580
computer science at Penn State and then

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,430
it's been almost 20 years since then as

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:21,080
a individual contributor and a manager

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:23,490
after I sold out so I started talking to

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,540
you know when I started in this field I

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,590
started looking around and I was like

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,570
wow there's not a lot of people that

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,310
look like me and this seems to be a

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,009
fairly homogeneous group and so I

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,920
started talking to folks that I coded

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,860
with my male peers about why they

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,810
started coding and I heard from them

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,439
that usually around the middle school

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:50,280
age they discovered something like a

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,049
game or an open or a community that got

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,600
them really excited and they were like

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,399
awesome when I grow up I'm going to be a

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,659
game developer and then they found out

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,070
that game developers don't make any

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,630
money so they decided to write

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,479
JavaScript and here they are now so we

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,910
started thinking about ways that we

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,980
could reach

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,380
girls and female identifying folks as

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,890
with products that are a little more

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,050
feminine and exciting for that group and

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,640
everyone here knows how important it is

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,490
to get kids coding for lots of different

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,230
reasons I really love this stat of

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,490
thinking of the jobs that don't exist

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,050
yet that kids need to learn about what

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,120
they're going to be doing I think the

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,030
cool thing about it is it's really up to

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,190
their imagination right so preparing

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,980
them to invent these amazing jobs is

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:48,690
super important and it leads to you a

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:52,140
lifetime of creativity and curiosity so

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,680
in 2015 we did a Kickstarter for jewel

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,180
baths

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,890
jewel bots are smart friendship

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,050
bracelets that light up when your

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,600
friends are nearby and you can code in

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,210
their open source we shipped over 10,000

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,690
robots to over 30 countries around the

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,910
world

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,680
we started getting feedback about our

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,040
products and one thing we heard from

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,420
parents that I didn't it turns out I

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
don't have kids but I know lots about

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,550
kids ask me any time they I heard about

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,300
the plastic box that they keep in their

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,250
rooms where the toys go that kids play

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,630
with then kind of get over it and it

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:31,560
goes in their box of plastic and I heard

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,530
from parents that kids enjoy jailbot's

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,610
they but you know with short attention

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,720
spans and the desire for new things all

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,900
the time was there something that we

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,290
could do that would be new and

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,120
interesting often so we started working

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,980
on science kits this is one thing that

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,380
you might notice is that when boys when

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,420
boys create we call it building and when

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,620
girls create we call it crafting really

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,340
it's just the same thing it's making

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,800
stuff and in the world of crafting there

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,250
are a ton of concepts that are science

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,610
focused and amazing and so we started

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,160
building science kits that have a lower

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,470
price point and allow kids to build

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,039
using their imagination and learn about

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,750
interesting concepts like geology and

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,449
chemistry

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,710
so today so we've been shipping those

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,569
for a little while

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,889
we've been getting great feedback so far

00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:35,139
and people have been making awesome

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:37,629
stuff today you're gonna see le demo a

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,210
kit that isn't even on sale yet if you

00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:42,659
go to Joel BOTS comm forward slash node

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:47,169
interactive although a case all one word

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:49,900
you can see the hello world LEDs which

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,599
is a kit that incorporates Arduino and

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,389
light up LEDs kids can make awesome

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:58,719
badges for their backpacks or their

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,279
t-shirts but I'm gonna stop going on

00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:03,000
because I'm an adult and adults are

00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:06,310
boring I'm gonna introduce you to

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,430
someone who I look up to a lot

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,129
Ellie started a YouTube channel about

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,870
Joel BOTS and now she does awesome

00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,830
things where she codes things like Joel

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,379
BOTS and lots of other neat stuff she

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,020
releases a video every week

00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:27,580
one needs part of this I think is that

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,750
her dad who's here today was the person

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,029
who coached me through my first

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,440
open-source pull request so it was

00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,000
really neat for it to come full circle

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,029
and now I get to work with his daughter

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,650
so I'm super pleased to introduce you to

00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:42,009
Ellie Galloway who's going to talk to

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,750
you about and do some the first-person

00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,960
here with guts to do some live coding on

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,669
stage super happy to introduce Ellie

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,699
Galloway he's going to talk more about

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,409
building the tool BOTS hello my name is

00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,000
Ellie Galloway I'm a Joel Watts

00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,360
ambassador and have been for a couple

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,250
years now I'm going to be covering a few

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,050
things today and that will be my story

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,509
which is not very long but it's very

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,360
special to me I'm going to show you how

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:10,029
I make my badge which I will explain

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,979
soon what that is I'm gonna show you how

00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,860
I cone my badge which is a live coding

00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:18,490
which is my favorite part and then women

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,319
in coding history and importance so

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,300
there's a big history behind that I'm

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,520
going to show you that so in the

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,990
presentation when I start live coding

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,969
I'll need your help so if you could

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,270
raise your hand or something that'd be

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:35,140
greatly appreciated okay so here's my

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,330
story so far so I grew up in California

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,300
which made it really difficult to pack

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,300
for this trip but it was really easy for

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,150
my dad because he was a pro he is a

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,410
programmer for Microsoft and he travels

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,720
around the world teaching different

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,910
people about code so I started to get

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,040
pretty curious on what all those numbers

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,170
and stuff meant and so I asked him about

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,840
it and he started to teach me through

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,970
games like unity coding for Minecraft

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,520
and different stuff like that he showed

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,360
me Joule Watts and I begged for one and

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,210
eventually he gave in okay so in 2018 I

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,690
spoke at my very first conference at Red

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,910
Hat

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,930
which was the best time of my life and

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,790
it was just really fun to do and so now

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,530
I'm gonna show you how I make my badge

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,290
so if you don't know what a badge is

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:26,170
it's a little felt thing so it has an

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:29,080
Arduino which is I'll explain what all

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,610
these things mean in a bit and LEDs so

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,230
you can code it and it lights up and

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,080
makes cool thing so people can play

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,910
around with it and do different codes

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,980
okay so here's what you'll need in

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,890
Arduino Jemma so I just mentioned that

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,670
think of this as a computer so this is

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,560
what you code this is basically like a

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,750
laptop or something and then you'll need

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,230
conductive thread and needles and what

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,810
these do is it's like a power cord so it

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,790
plugs from your computer and then the

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,370
LED sequence is your final destination

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,130
it's the outlet just to make sure the

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,230
code is running smoothly and you also

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,630
need felt for your workspace so anything

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:11,500
optional is decorative different things

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,390
like that so here's your plan you don't

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,780
need to make it as detailed or anything

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:18,670
I just did it because well I'm speaking

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,400
but you will need to map out a few

00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,520
things and that your Jemma you need to

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,880
map out the ground or GND which is a

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,590
metal plate also the d1 and then you

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,590
want to map out your stitching from that

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,840
and then from that the LEDs so you might

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,570
want to make note that you need to have

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,960
it negative and positive in a certain

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,750
order

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,300
you can't just switch it around that has

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,700
a huge thing to do with the code so

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
you'll need to make sure that the

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,330
negative

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,240
is on the ground side and also make a

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,370
note that if you cross the threads it

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,500
will lead to a short-circuit both of

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,080
those things will so you just want to be

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:04,420
careful because it might start smoking

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:07,320
ask me how I know so step two is cell

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,600
loops around the ground so the Jandy

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,459
basically this just makes it so it's

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,050
secure because this can go in your

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,730
clothing and stuff like that is going on

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,250
fabric so you're going to use it a bit

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,880
so you do want it to be secure and

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,970
secure it's securely on the thing that

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,459
you want it to be on and also it's kind

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,830
of hard to actually have the code

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,480
running if it's barely on there for

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,970
instance if we go back to the other

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,920
example of the power cord and everything

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,790
you want to plug it in right or it won't

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,839
work

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,910
in charge so that's very important okay

00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,459
so now you're gonna sew that sequence on

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,860
and so again you want to make sure the

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,870
negative and positive sides I'm just

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:54,910
repeating you again because I forgot and

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,709
yeah it started smoking so now you're

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,060
going to repeat on the other side so

00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,760
what I mean by this and you're just

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,050
gonna finish that line I'm tie knot and

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:07,870
then you're gonna start a whole new

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:11,529
stitch and go from the d1 to down and

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,390
sew across all the LEDs and I forgot to

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,990
mention you do want to sew loops around

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:19,839
the LEDs too but after that - just tie

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,270
knot don't cross or anything cuz well I

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,110
know it's okay lots of ways you can mess

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:28,480
up in this so then you're done you can

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,490
decorate if you want again you can add

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,240
embroidery floss you can take

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,010
inspiration from me i embroidered on one

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,959
and then I made it look like a Polaroid

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,709
camera on the other and just have some

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,930
fun with it

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,600
okay so now you're done and I'm gonna

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,130
show you how I code my badge but before

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,230
we do that we are learning a whole new

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,700
language and I don't just want to copy

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,579
things down because you want to actually

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,770
learn something from it or there's no

00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:55,240
point in doing it so I'm going to

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,699
translate all these things and make it

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,730
easy to remember so turning on and off

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,720
is

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:06,800
high and low basically the LED voltage

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,990
would be higher so that's how you know

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,310
high because it's brighter and then a

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:16,519
lower boat voltage would be dimmer or

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,740
completely off then starting off the kid

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,570
this is a fun one I did digital right

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,959
because you're digitally riding I

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,490
thought that was funny um so now we're

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,399
stating the LED as pin mode

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,100
I think of it as the LED sequence as a

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:39,010
pin and what mode you're putting it on

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:42,500
so now we can get to the live demo okay

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,839
so now we are going to start at the

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,649
beginning and void setup so I'm going to

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:54,040
do pin mode to start off the LED and I'm

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:58,370
going to do built wait sorry LED

00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,339
underscore built and and now I'm gonna

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,920
do a comma and so what we need here is

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:05,870
to give the LED output so I'm just gonna

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,940
write output right here and it's as

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,410
simple as that okay so now we're gonna

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:17,000
go down here and I'm going to basically

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:23,870
make it blinking on the gemma so I'm

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:28,639
going to do digital right now I'm going

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,160
to do the same thing LED built-in comma

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,720
okay so if we want to start it off I'm

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,699
going to turn it on so high okay and now

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,839
I'm going to delay and I'm gonna delay

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:44,180
this for 500 milliseconds which is

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,649
equivalent to a half second then I'm

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:54,769
going to do digital right again I'm

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:57,970
going to do LED built-in okay so I'm

00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:02,269
just making sure you're paying attention

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,260
if we wanted to make it blink which

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:09,900
would we put next would be Polk high

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:12,980
raise your hand for high okay low

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:17,640
okay yeah good you're paying attention

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,860
okay so I'm gonna do low okay so now I'm

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,330
just gonna delay it for the same amount

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,120
of time to make it even okay so now

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,880
let's see how it works let me find my

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,920
plug okay

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,920
so here is the Gemma

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,059
[Applause]

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,630
yeah okay it worked so let's get back to

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:55,690
the presentation

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:58,810
okay and now let's go to women and code

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,580
so this is history and importance okay

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,800
so as you can see from these numbers

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,940
they're pretty sad like it's pretty

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,100
uneven right I want to change that so

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,810
here's the weird part you might be like

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,910
well maybe women just aren't interested

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,670
in code but that's very far from the

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,550
truth so when I was researching this

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,590
topic I saw that Ada Lovelace and

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,510
Charles Babbage worked together to

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,700
create the very first computer and ADA

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,800
was the first one to program in it so as

00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,350
you can see from the picture it's a

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,110
pretty old model like this isn't when

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,700
you just see flying around but she still

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,070
worked with what she had and she

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,880
programmed it and she was the very first

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,270
- so who invented computer software so

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,700
Grace Hopper invented the very first

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:49,150
system and this was back in the 1950s

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,850
she also worked in the Navy's Navy and

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,950
that's really impressive because not a

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,810
lot of women worked in the Navy back

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,840
then and so she's a really great role

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,050
model so who invented the computer is

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,930
telephone so Ernest Neider Hoover

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,640
created the first computerized telephone

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,820
and this revolutionized modern

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,180
technology and this was even back in the

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:17,140
1960s - 70s so why aren't more women in

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,610
code so here's what I found so they

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,880
don't really have robot toys in the

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,980
1950s but this is kind of a more recent

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,070
thing and that's when we see the decline

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,430
so I'm not saying that these toys aren't

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:32,050
good because nowadays we see a lot of

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,620
male programmers and that's because

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:39,310
those kind of electronic toys go more to

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,680
the boys aisle so girls don't really get

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:45,280
inspired that way and it makes it hard

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,930
for instance people wouldn't be

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,990
interested in the topic if they're not

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,840
seeing how it works and how it's fun

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,210
so either girls had to do

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,100
was it or if they are like me and snuck

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:59,880
into the boys out to get hex bugs and

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,120
take them apart but ada lovelace I'm

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,130
sorry Grace Hopper did that too she took

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,070
apart clocks and she worked with them

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:13,350
and now she's a huge role model today

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,300
okay so why should women code first off

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,980
we need more programmers I didn't how

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,490
much more things we could get done

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,920
faster and the whole modern era would be

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,230
so much more advanced also women can

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,060
code just as well as males and more

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,520
ideas get spread around we'd have more

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:33,120
input from different people and we'd

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,740
have so much more things today so here's

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,080
one of my favorite quotes from Grace

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,060
Hopper which are humans are allergic to

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,100
change they love to say we've always

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,440
done it this way I tried to fight that

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,100
that's why I have a clock on my wall

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,380
that runs counterclockwise so I'm I run

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,410
my clock counterclockwise and I hope you

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,090
do too so thank you have a wonderful day

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,740
my youtube channel is Ellie Galloway

00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,020
geobox and you should find me in case

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,570
you liked what you heard but other than

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,420
that I hope you have a wonderful rest of

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,690
your day at the node.js interactive

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:13,019
