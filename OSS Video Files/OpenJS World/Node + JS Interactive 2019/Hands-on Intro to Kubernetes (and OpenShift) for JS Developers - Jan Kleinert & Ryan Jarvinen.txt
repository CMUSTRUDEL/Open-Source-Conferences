Learn to build and deploy cloud-native Node.js applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift through a series of hands-on lab examples.

This interactive session involves using kubectl, oc, curl, and common command-line tools to interact with Kubernetes APIs. By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll be deploying, scaling, and automating JS-based distributed solutions using containers, Kubernetes, and other popular open source tools for distributed computing.

These examples are designed to show JS developers how to maintain speed and productivity with a container-based development workflow.
