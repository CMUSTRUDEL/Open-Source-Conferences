Description: 
	Panel: Open Source, Standards, and Economics - Jory Burson, Bocoup; James Bryce Clark, OASIS; Wendy Seltzer, W3C; Luis Villa, Tidelift
Speakers: Luis Villa, Jory Burson, James Bryce Clark, Wendy Seltzer
This panel will discuss the real policy and economic impact of open source and standards, with an emphasis on issues that affect developers. The panel hopes to help give the audience a more nuanced understanding of the business and policy mechanics that drive the JavaScript ecosystem, and how they can make more informed choices about their participation. We hope to help them understand common issues that often lead to FUD, such as patent vs. copyright concerns, and what they need to consider as individuals when participating in activities like crowdfunding open source development. We will also talk about how traditional models of open source and standards work are changing - where they are succeeding and where they are falling short.
