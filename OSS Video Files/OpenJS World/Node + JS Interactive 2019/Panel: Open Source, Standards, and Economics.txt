Title: Panel: Open Source, Standards, and Economics
Publication date: 2020-05-11
Playlist: Node + JS Interactive 2019
Description: 
	Panel: Open Source, Standards, and Economics - Jory Burson, Bocoup; James Bryce Clark, OASIS; Wendy Seltzer, W3C; Luis Villa, Tidelift
Speakers: Luis Villa, Jory Burson, James Bryce Clark, Wendy Seltzer
This panel will discuss the real policy and economic impact of open source and standards, with an emphasis on issues that affect developers. The panel hopes to help give the audience a more nuanced understanding of the business and policy mechanics that drive the JavaScript ecosystem, and how they can make more informed choices about their participation. We hope to help them understand common issues that often lead to FUD, such as patent vs. copyright concerns, and what they need to consider as individuals when participating in activities like crowdfunding open source development. We will also talk about how traditional models of open source and standards work are changing - where they are succeeding and where they are falling short.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
we have just about an hour which is

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,800
really great because we are accompanied

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,110
here by three very well respected

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,420
attorneys and who are known for their

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,859
intelligence as well as their loquacious

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,039
Ness so we will give each of them a few

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,789
minutes to introduce themselves as well

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,830
as their areas of expertise I want to

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,500
invite you all we have we have some

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,160
topics we're going to cover but if you

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,550
have any questions for the panelists you

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,780
are very welcome to tweet them at me at

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:47,309
Jory comm on Twitter and I'd be happy to

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,590
work those into the conversation you

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,460
know we have to say as as Wendy likes to

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,500
tell me that these lawyers are not your

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,239
lawyers so you know bear that in mind

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,070
definitely if you have specific

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,299
questions related to your projects you

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,040
should retain your own counsel and

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:13,320
friends our safe word today is amicus

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,650
brief so if we're on too long we can

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,530
that use that to just give to the next

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,409
question but um I would like to start

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,000
maybe with my colleague Jamie if you

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,560
don't mind sharing a few minutes of

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,530
introducing yourself and your areas of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,540
expertise please hi I'm Jamie Clark I

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,090
grew up in Minnesota I live in LA now I

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,890
am from and currently the general

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,020
counsel of the open standards and open

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,850
source group oasis which created a lot

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,320
of stuff over the last 20 years or so

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,590
although not quite as much as Wendy's

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,450
group who's been terribly prolific we

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,299
probably lived mostly in the e-commerce

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,470
and structured documents area so if

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,659
you've heard of Oasis you heard about

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,149
either because of security stuff like

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,829
sam'l or sticks and taxi or you've heard

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,170
about it because of structured eat

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:05,369
government stuff like open document

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,380
format I happen into this because when I

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,599
was a baby lawyer a long time ago I had

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,370
some clients come to me and say so I got

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,690
some salesmen from a large company to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,300
want to sell me all this electronic

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,650
stuff

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,330
and they don't have to use paper anymore

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,980
I can introduce it all to records and

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,300
have it all be electronic only I just

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,710
don't know if any of that'll work if I

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,630
go to the court and say Your Honor

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,490
here's my contract I hope from this

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,410
paper or this tape or something does

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,290
that work it's enforceable and in 1998

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,700
or so it wasn't so I got dragged into

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,290
about 15 years of trying to make sure

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,630
electronic signatures actually were

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,880
recognized as legal signatures which as

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,530
you know is kind of old hat now but boy

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,000
where courts confused by those things in

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,040
the first place and so eventually I went

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,140
pro went to my wife and say honey can I

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,830
go work for a foundation and take a pay

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,910
cut of a 9/10 of my salary and do cool

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,240
Internet stuff for the rest of my life

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,030
and she said Oh fine if you have to so

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,520
here I am working far away's this mostly

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,990
helping keep their open source and open

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,750
standards programs on the straight and

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,610
narrow and kind of doing things in ways

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,210
they're cooperative and usually not

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,580
illegal immoral or fattening we are all

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,000
lawyers in different roles and I just

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,080
want to say our job it's actually pretty

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,150
well predicted I mean you could actually

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
do a UML chart for our job because the

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,900
idea is as a package we're supposed to

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,610
take all those crazy bad things can

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,370
happen to you and roll them up into

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,200
black boxes and give you rules and

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,870
suggestions and guidelines and templates

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,130
for how to do your thing without having

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,360
to think about us and then we're

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,090
supposed to basically disappear

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,820
basically if facilitators and lawyers

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,650
and rules people and license people do a

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,090
good job of creating your community and

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,239
helping you guide through stuff and

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,920
figure out what to avoid then you can

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,630
just go off and be Duff's and work on

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,100
stuff and have committees and cooperate

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,280
and never have to crack a rule book or

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,920
Robert's Rules or a procedure thing or a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,510
license we really ought to be just

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,540
making it possible for people to

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:02,950
collaborate in a safe space without

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,020
running into you know multiple kinds of

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:09,850
legal problems so if we do our job well

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:15,280
hopefully we become invisible so far not

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:17,260
so good yeah I usually refer to us as as

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,290
an API to the rest of the legal system

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,910
where hopefully you don't have to worry

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,780
about the implement each implementation

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,540
details sometimes it does leak through

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,750
so so

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,630
hi I'm Liz via I am an attorney former

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,690
programmer I got involved in my baby

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,040
lawyer story is that I was at Simeon

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,870
which some of you may remember as a

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,010
Linux desktop startup in the very

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,530
distant past

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,230
we got acquired by Novell I was involved

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,540
in the I was involved in the diligence

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,360
there and dealing with niveles lawyers

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,970
and I naively arrogantly thought oh I

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,460
can do better than this

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,430
and so anyway since then I've been

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,340
slowly learning how wrong that was at

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,730
first at Mozilla then for a while at

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,070
Greenberg big law firm working on with

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,110
many of you probably work for companies

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,850
that were my clients then then a

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,520
wikimedia and now to start up called

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,130
tide lifts what we do a tide lift is we

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,650
are building a platform to help

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,960
open-source developers get paid for

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,820
making open-source work better right we

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,790
believe that you can think of it almost

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,440
as a red hat for the rest of the stack

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,950
where we make things more secure more

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,500
reliable we make the legal stuff go more

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,300
smoothly and exchange enterprises pay us

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,310
for that and we pay the actual

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,280
developers who are doing the work right

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,140
the original open-source developers not

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,520
some random Schmo in the cloud or a

00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,880
contractor but the people who actually

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,190
created the value because we think you

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,290
know open-source has created literally

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,900
hundreds of billions of dollars worth of

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,450
value and it's time for open-source

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,400
developers to capture even a tiny little

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,800
fragment of that if that can be done

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,750
then we will all be better off right

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,080
both the developers who capture some of

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,710
that value and hopefully the companies

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,960
that are our customers by making it a

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,630
little more robust my interest in this

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,300
stuff has always been about licensing

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,940
and about how people work together and

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,490
licensing is a way that that happens

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,060
they're not the only way so yeah I guess

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,840
yeah thank you

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,400
and I'm Wendy seltzer I am strategy lead

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,240
and counsel at the World Wide Web

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,660
Consortium w3c I got there through a

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,820
winding path of

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:45,500
interests in law and open source and in

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,020
the early days of fighting the the

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,110
copyright term extension and copyright

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,450
claim overreach founded the chilling

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,930
effects Clearing House project now known

00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:00,980
as lumen database tracking notice and

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:04,400
takedown requests and giving people the

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:08,960
legal information to help them fight

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,560
back against misguided requests and like

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,920
Lewis and Jamie my interest has been in

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,740
the ways that law can help creative

00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,320
people do the things that they want to

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,390
do without the law getting in the way

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,270
whether that's artists creating works

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,100
that build upon the creative works of

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,890
others and add new things to our

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,770
cultural discourse fighting some of that

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,760
the copyright restrictions or coders

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,160
trying to work together to develop

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,080
interoperable platforms that anyone can

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,480
use without paying patent royalties to

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,350
someone who comes in you know asserting

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:52,460
that everything you've made is you know

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:55,430
an infringement of their patent you know

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,060
I think law can actually help in

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:03,620
creating and reinforcing common

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,020
infrastructure so the best uses of law I

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,290
think of are things like patent

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,370
commitments and copyleft places where

00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:16,760
people agree not to assert legal claims

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:20,930
against one another but to pool their

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:24,170
their resources and create opportunities

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,840
for them and others to build value on

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:31,040
top of this shared infrastructure so at

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,000
w3c I work on our process and our patent

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,220
policy to help make that work for the

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,750
ways that people are developing web

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:45,800
standards so that let me say one thing

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,630
Wendy's wait way to shot wendy is on the

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,670
boarded records of tour she was one of

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,080
the early staff members at EF F I mean I

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,640
trying to get cool by standing around

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,780
her so read her resume she's got an

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,440
incredible background we're both

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,300
basically the legal people at two large

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,880
standards consortiums but she's the cool

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,690
one well you get to keep that one

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,880
agreed plus one Wendy badass

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,200
you've also set us up really nicely to

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,460
talk about a text that has been kind of

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,520
making the rounds quite a bit in the

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,580
open source world and also among your

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,910
community as well which is the Elinor

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,180
Ostrom work on governing the Commons and

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,250
we have talked a lot about sort of the

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,990
Commons common infrastructure support

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,880
but then there's also this idea of the

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,150
tragedy of the Commons that it's doomed

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,920
to fail and we we started with a really

00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,600
lovely conversation last night you said

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,190
it really well Louis that not all

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,100
Commons are tragic I wonder if you could

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,130
introduce yeah sure so I mean I think

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,160
one way that we think of ourselves is as

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,470
engineers of healthy Commons right and

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,470
there's this I think for a long time

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,390
particularly in the US but globally a

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,430
lot of economists have pushed this

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,010
vision of the the tragedy of the Commons

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,950
right and in that all Commons ultimately

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:07,640
are overrun the people take too much and

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,750
give too little and I wanted to set the

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,940
table a little bit for today's

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,430
conversation by saying that actually

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:18,290
Elinor Ostrom who won the Nobel Prize

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,990
for economics in 2009 I believe devoted

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,020
her career to studying all the Commons

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,380
that aren't tragic right that do succeed

00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,260
and she identified over 900 Commons in

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,820
her research often they were water

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:37,340
Commons in fact some of them originally

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:39,140
in LA and I then went then spent a

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,660
career and the careers of many grad

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,370
students identifying common themes right

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,130
what are things that actually make those

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,600
Commons work and I'm gonna go through

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,550
and highlight a few of these and they

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,860
are all gonna sound very familiar to you

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,720
because you're going to have seen them

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,670
in the communities that you are part of

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,860
that work well you're gonna have seen

00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,600
them they're gonna ring a bell right so

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,490
one thing that she talked about is

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,660
clearly defined boundaries you have to

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,199
know who's in and who

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,850
out right modularity is that is the word

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,459
that we use for this in our space right

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,740
we know who's participating and how they

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,610
participate in a way that's very clear

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,769
for everybody

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,139
there's proportional equivalents between

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,629
benefits and costs in other words you

00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:22,699
don't want people who are purely free

00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:25,850
riding you want to have hopefully some

00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,800
way for them to contribute we talked

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,660
about she talks about monitoring you

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,670
have to know how it's being used this is

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,199
something frankly an open source maybe

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,069
doesn't do so well and could learn from

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:38,959
right where we have a sense of we have a

00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:41,839
sense of our stars aren't github and our

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,350
NPM counts but that's maybe about it

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,509
right she talks about a fast and fair

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,759
conflict resolution right the more clear

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:51,470
things are the better for everybody this

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,139
is one of the things that we try to

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,430
bring in and our work is making sure and

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,170
one of the things I'm most proud of in

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,470
my career is the Mozilla public license

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,129
version 2 where it's a copy left is a

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,180
copy left with very clear boundaries a

00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,370
couple others that I think I'll skip

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,689
over here but the point that I wanted to

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,779
drive home is that there are patterns

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:13,970
that we can know and follow in making

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:17,420
healthy communities this is not magic

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,709
it's not you know it's not something

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,300
that we have to reinvent all these

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:22,279
wheels and hopefully that's something

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,579
that lawyers can help with as you all

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,860
focus on the technology let me

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,880
contextualise that a little bit what's

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,300
the point of that list

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,850
well not it got Lynn Ostrom the Nobel

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,259
and that's nice but also you'll find a

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,439
bunch of public policy issues you'll

00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,699
find WTO principles about standards and

00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:43,130
what's a real standard what's a fake

00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:44,959
standard you'll find accreditation

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,329
bodies in both open source and open

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,620
standards that test bodies to say okay

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,630
are we gonna let you just emit yourself

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,649
to other places our government's going

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,199
to include your stuff and their

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,120
procurement requirements and they test a

00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:57,439
lot of those same conditions furthermore

00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,569
those are the preconditions to fairness

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,709
if you're putting an effort you know are

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,269
you likely to get something out of it

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,449
are you if you get railroaded by you

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:07,610
good likely to get big-footed

00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,110
the simple way to look at that stuff

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,850
from your standpoint whether it's not

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,110
just in nodejs which is fairly mature

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,389
now and has a pretty good governance

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,460
system so far but in any open source or

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,650
open development shared project

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,350
if you have that stuff there if you can

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,560
detect fear conflict resolution

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,730
modularity transparency yada yada yada

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,410
then you're probably a good place and

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,820
your works probably gonna work out

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,740
pretty well yeah or at least you're

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,540
gonna get a fair shot if those things

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,920
are not present if you're designing a

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,660
community and you don't haven't provided

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,480
for that ever you're in a place and they

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,790
do don't though those things the project

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,080
has a very strong chance of failing so

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,720
you might think of them almost as health

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,760
indicators for open shared projects

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,710
which includes you know standard stuff

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,360
like Wendy's organization to mine and

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,110
ISO and ANSI any rails have been doing

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,580
for 30 40 years but also includes the

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:02,300
next open source project created

00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:04,490
tomorrow and Jamie one other thing that

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,880
you had pointed out was that you know

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,440
that in a similar vein that standards

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,250
development organizations kind of get

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,200
evaluated on the same principles I

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,990
wonder if you can speak a little bit

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,340
more to that well we've been doing some

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,290
interesting engineering lately because

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,730
the traditional sources of open

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,890
development alike open standards groups

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,170
like Wendy's in mind have all been under

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,240
we think good market pressure to adopt

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,550
open source methods and tools and so you

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,320
wouldn't have seen any you wouldn't have

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,180
seen a lot of SourceForge material in

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,670
the mainstream of a w3c recommendation

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,130
or ways to standard ten years ago there

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,500
was some because we've always had our

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,840
standards sort of supported by and

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,030
starts were to pre github open source

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,650
builds as kind of proofs of concept but

00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,140
in terms of where the actual you know

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,180
the the canonical standard lives now you

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,510
can go to github and find a lot of them

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,220
for w3c or Oasis and increasingly even

00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,910
some of the ISOs and the fuddy-duddies

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,980
I'm sorry

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,660
like I Triple E are trying to find ways

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,970
to put their stuff there because that's

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,010
where people want to find it you know I

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,950
mean you have an SPD X tag on your

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,860
standard well if you don't if you're

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,910
taking you know your comments against a

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,770
standard and you're not getting them as

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,000
PRS then a lot of people won't know

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,160
where to find it or know what to do with

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,950
them or be able to you know communicate

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,320
that in a modern development environment

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,540
so we are kind of fishing in the same

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,339
streams now there is a difference which

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,760
i think is worth mentioning and this is

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,400
not about licensing which will get

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,980
later standards have the benefit of

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,980
having 20 or 30 years of experience with

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,560
government and large company procurement

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,960
people kind of know institutional

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,540
adopters kind of know were a safe place

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,850
to borrow material and so if something

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,590
is created as a standard you know you

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,850
don't get a lot of flack from some

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,870
European Commission Department that

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,280
wants to adopt it because they're

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,710
comfortable with standards you know how

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,080
to do that the whole web accessibility

00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,370
movement which was just practically

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,930
missing from some of the early parts of

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,660
the web got started as a consortium

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,820
project at w3c and now it has been

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,470
reared on and picked up and enacted it's

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,090
the law in Europe it's you know and

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,960
everybody's guidelines and every but

00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,750
basically the thing that made it

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,890
comfortable for large agencies and large

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,720
governments and large companies to

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,420
provide Lee adopted is because of the

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,060
stability of having an infrastructure

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,490
like w3c s approval process to rely on

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,750
so a benefit we get from open standards

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,480
is that everybody knows what they are

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,700
the history of procurement of

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,990
open-source work has been spotty because

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,550
a lot of lawyers and a lot of companies

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,470
were very standoffish about it at first

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,290
it was seemed as a more chaotic process

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,210
its licensing was regarded as not as

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,450
clear and not as reliable and so

00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,810
open-source as it matures is finding a

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:51,540
better kind of frame within procurement

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,370
as a safer place for us at oasis we are

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,130
now actually creating some open

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,810
standards using open source licenses and

00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,550
so it's been sort of interesting to take

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,260
that stuff back to an ISO or a

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,760
procurement agent and say yeah it's a

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,740
standard but it's also open source and

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,990
yes that's okay and it won't bite you

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,510
which is kind of a new concept for a lot

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,120
of traditional users but the what I want

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,400
to convey here is that there's a

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,470
sanctioning aspect there's a operating

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,329
according to known rules and procedures

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,839
and licenses so that people know that as

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:25,440
is safe as a source of whether it's code

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,500
specs models or api's that you're a safe

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,540
place from which users can widely adopt

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,090
you saw that that sense of how to run

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,040
things safely and clearly and with known

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,110
licensing and known consequences and

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,030
known boundaries is hugely important

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,470
when the people who we talk to come to

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,020
us and say hey I heard there's this

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,070
thing there's this module from something

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,320
called the node

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,880
foundation that does this yada-yada

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,740
thing which I've never heard of can I

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,440
use it is this as safe as if I went used

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,800
an ISO standard you know bottom line you

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,690
want the answer to be yes you know let

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,780
me I mean one thing that may make that

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,610
really concrete lawyers are like

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,710
programmers there's a lot of you could

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,750
do a whole great panel just on analogies

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,360
between lawyers and programmers but one

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,200
way that I think there's this you know

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,870
nobody ever got fired for buying IBM and

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,180
in the same way we as lawyers seek to

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,340
say nobody ever got fired for choosing

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,530
this license or choosing the standards

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,200
body right where it's it's a well

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,690
accepted everybody knows maybe you don't

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,980
know the details right like there are a

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,930
lot of lawyers who use a lot of

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,370
open-source licenses who could not

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,560
actually explain to you how they work

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,320
right but because they're well

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,600
understood they're they're well like

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,330
they know that other lawyers know and so

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:47,040
there's that network effect of learning

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:50,310
around these things and I think that

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,720
that serves as a way of sort of division

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,980
of of expertise that you know

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,440
programmers don't have to be experts in

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,800
the licensing conditions or in all of

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,800
the possible governance structures that

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,190
could be be used that they can take

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,620
patterns from organizations that have

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,400
done some of that work found patterns

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:18,300
that that work well and are you know

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,330
relied upon that work in legal

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,180
enforcement that work for government

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:27,200
regulation that and that work for

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,420
communities that you know our process

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,840
w3c s process is often accused of being

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:36,810
too long and unwieldy and too detailed

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,990
but at the same time it saves people

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,330
from reinventing that structure every

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,640
time they're trying to make a new

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:49,830
decision yes sometimes you may need to

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,170
reinvent something because conditions

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,860
have changed but if you're doing

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:58,120
something that's been done before the

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,320
patterns that worked well in the past

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:07,810
may well serve you - and so that's low

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:10,450
friction low barrier to reuse helps get

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,850
you know the focus on writing the best

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,500
spec making the best security

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,750
considerations and privacy and

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,180
accessibility and strong

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,880
interoperability and testing and the

00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,450
things that we need to get a clear base

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:29,050
of running code so I want to ask about

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,120
the importance of having multiple

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,070
stakeholders but you actually just

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,690
touched on something because we are

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:38,670
speaking to a room of developers and

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,740
programmers and these documents are

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:46,030
written for lawyers what does a

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:50,370
developer need to know about their open

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:56,140
source license like what's the like

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:59,140
thing that's the small thing well there

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:05,560
are you know two key bundles of rights

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:07,870
that are included in most licenses that

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:13,530
the copyrights and they that the patents

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,530
and copyright is a protection for I

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,500
ideas fixed in a tangible medium of

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:25,450
expression your your code is

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:28,150
copyrightable and and those those using

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,810
it need a license that permits them to

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:35,410
copy it as they do when they use or

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:44,470
modify or run the code and then and and

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:51,310
patents which are more the the idea that

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:57,310
the function of code and anyone can

00:21:51,310 --> 00:22:00,550
claim the inventor can claim protection

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:05,680
of functionality even in something that

00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:09,610
somebody else implemented and so a lot

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,600
of open-source licenses and a lot of

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,830
standards bodies work

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:19,640
to develop various ways of pooling

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:24,110
patent protections or defensive rights

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,840
so that when so for example at w3c we

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:31,070
have a royalty-free patent policy

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:33,340
anyone who contributes to a participates

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,540
in the development of a specification

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,230
commits that they will not assert

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:45,250
patents on so-called essential flames to

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:50,390
that spec that you know even if not and

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,470
so that even if they have patents in

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,740
their cupboard

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,820
they won't assert them against somebody

00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:21,710
who's trying to make an interoperable

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:24,170
implementation of a spec also they're

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,150
promising that they won't sue you if you

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,420
use the other guy's contribution so if

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,340
Louie joy or our committee you know each

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,640
of us may promise that we will let you

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,230
use our contributions duh but also if

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,600
there's a final product you come out of

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,870
a process like the standards process and

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,730
this is true in a couple of open-source

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,800
projects but not most that also means

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,420
that if you use my contributions we

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,810
won't sue you and you if you use Joy's

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:53,300
contributions you know when he won't see

00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,070
you this is a significant improvement in

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,010
terms of stability and so for example

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,110
ripped out of the news yesterday anybody

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,240
watched Twitter see Jack Dorsey saying

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,530
oh gosh you know I've just realized that

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,340
maybe there should be a stand

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,200
Malti uh company standard for for tweets

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,820
or for you know social media anyway and

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,370
the Dirar

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,720
okay and you know I mean that's great

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,370
good good for him

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,870
and without any comment other than that

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,850
I would love to see something like that

00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,680
happen I'll just point out that w3c had

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,870
a project on that like what eight years

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,440
ago I mean evan perot madhu made it up

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,740
who's up

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,470
by the way I made up status net maybe 10

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,210
years ago now and worked out a system

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,700
for a while and it became an it can't

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,170
became an activities at w3c and they

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,120
went through all the a may see basically

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,890
that whole idea got laundered through a

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,140
process of multiple stakeholders and

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,940
multiple contributors and find licenses

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,680
and so basically yeah Jack we already

00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,090
have one of those now maybe it'll be

00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,190
adapted maybe something else will be

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,750
better but my point is you are better

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,280
off when you start from something that's

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,930
been established through a process with

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,340
multiple stakeholders which is your

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,140
point and with some kind of stable

00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,630
understanding about the licenses which

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,610
is your point and there are a lot of

00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,100
good things out there that have come

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,900
from that process which is why we're all

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,180
advocates have reused not reinventing

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,820
the wheel every time and refighting all

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,760
the license battles I was actually gonna

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:17,600
say you know Jory you asked like what

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,430
should we know yes there's really one

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,850
thing you should know and that is who

00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:27,590
else is using it right like if you if

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:29,570
you only know one thing we are I say we

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:35,020
hear both about programmers and about

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:40,220
lawyers we are herd animals and so the

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:42,020
idea that you know it's actually there

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,830
was a time when I first got involved in

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,690
all this stuff the you know everybody

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,730
knew all the licenses right like

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,340
literally to become a Debian developer

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,820
which was sort of in some sense the

00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,070
spiritual forerunner of being of having

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,590
a package on NPM you literally had to

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,810
pass a test to show that you knew all

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,470
this stuff about all of the licenses

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:08,540
right and in some ways that was good

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,810
everybody was an expert everybody had

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,460
deep knowledge and in other ways that

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,020
really got in the way of actually doing

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:19,880
the thing we want to do which is

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,650
actually write some code right and and I

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,020
think in some ways in some ways there's

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:27,350
a sense of something there's some loss

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,910
there right but it's also I think you

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,980
know simply looking around the room and

00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,510
being like you know what the entire rest

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,630
of the industry has been using the BSD

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:37,910
license for 30 years and it hasn't

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,210
melted down yet like that's actually a

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,550
pretty

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,870
good point for like actually maybe we

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,420
can probably keep using it for the next

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,310
30 years and it probably won't now if

00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,660
you get if you buy me a drink tonight I

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,240
will tell you all the ways in which it

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,850
might melt down but that's for another

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,190
conversation doom and gloom and but I

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,380
think so this this came from Twitter but

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,940
I think there's a bit of a tension here

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,650
right where we want to simplify things

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,440
enough and just say don't worry about it

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,060
developer community just you know it's

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,340
it's okay we got it covered but at the

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,940
same time we want to make sure that

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,100
these communities are like you know

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,880
knowledge is empowering like we want

00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,100
them to feel like this is knowable to

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,980
them and so you know what what is the

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,280
right sort of balance for that you know

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,850
nervous developer who's trying to think

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,810
about licensing their first project like

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:36,500
really is it just you know well I think

00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:40,370
if you're in a company talk to your

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,370
company's lawyers if you're working on

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,650
your own talk to a friendly lawyer and

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:48,680
think about what it is that you or your

00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:53,180
organization are trying to protect what

00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:56,840
are you trying to create and what legal

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,970
structure helps you to do that and you

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,920
know we have big companies and small

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,380
companies and individuals who contribute

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:07,010
to open standards and who contribute to

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,020
that royalty-free pool because what they

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,000
want to protect is the ability to

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,430
interoperate and the ability to work

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,680
with others in a safe environment where

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,060
all of them know that none of them is

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,670
gonna pull a patent out of their back

00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:23,150
pocket and undermine this web we've

00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,500
created and yeah there's there's room

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,900
for patents and there's room for

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,060
proprietary stuff on top of that stack

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,190
you have the core interoperable web and

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,860
then you have optimizations that people

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,520
can patent and applications that people

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,960
can sell on top of that and over time

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,910
the core of the common royalty-free

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,190
piece grows and there are new

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,820
opportunities further out on the edge to

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,299
you know to develop something

00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,720
proprietary and you know

00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:58,350
that you know grow the interoperable

00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,269
core and build something of your own on

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:07,320
top is a powerful strategy and you know

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:09,659
it can be a good strategy for you know

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:15,090
selling your services for selling your

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:19,769
products for rope expanding the value

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:21,899
that you provide and create yeah I mean

00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:23,730
I think that that's the key really is

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:26,549
understanding what it is you want to do

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,409
right if this is a small piece of I

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:29,879
don't want to say throw away JavaScript

00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:32,429
right but we know that there are a lot

00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:35,009
of modules on NPM that were a sort of

00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:37,139
weekend hack and are never gonna be more

00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:39,539
than a weekend hack and in that case

00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:43,080
putting it under the same license that

00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:44,100
everybody else uses on NPM a bsd or MIT

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,289
something like that so that everybody

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,669
else just uses it in the same way

00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:49,409
they're used to is probably gonna

00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:51,179
achieve your goals because your your

00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,359
goals for publishing a weekend hack or

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,009
like I hope it's useful to somebody and

00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,570
and you know and if it is great and if

00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,639
it's not I'm not gonna worry about it

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:01,590
right but if you're like trying to start

00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,730
a business or you are already part of a

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,009
business and you're trying to work with

00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,799
other businesses then things get more

00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:12,629
complicated and you have to ask deeper

00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:15,509
questions you know I will say there's a

00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:18,269
spectrum here of not knowing anything on

00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:20,159
one side actually going to law school on

00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:21,929
the other side do not recommend that if

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,129
you're thinking of that if you're

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:27,600
thinking of that I will buy you the

00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:29,039
drink and we'll discuss tonight you know

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,139
and somewhere in between there are a lot

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,470
of good resources in particular I really

00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:36,690
like there's a board member of the

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,850
Python Software Foundation van Lindberg

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,039
for also a former engineer turned lawyer

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,999
has written a really excellent book that

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,200
explains a lot of these concepts and

00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:49,470
that explains a lot of these concepts in

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,480
like engineer accessible frameworks and

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:55,080
I highly recommend that book because it

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,759
is you know unfortunately like the

00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,639
optimal level of understanding

00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,649
if you're asking complex questions like

00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:03,899
how do I work with other companies is

00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,570
probably closer to book length than

00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:08,919
paneling

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:12,220
mmm aye he's gonna look up the name the

00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:16,870
book for you so if if you're in that

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,460
space God willing you do some of your

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,620
work in an organization where they've

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,750
got good and hardened rules and you can

00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,070
generally conduct yourself without

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,840
worrying about it because the rules take

00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,909
care of it for you they license rules

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,519
but also disclosure rules you know that

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:32,590
nodejs just adopted it's a new IPR

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,820
policy as I understand it so that I'm

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,740
not an expert on it but one of the

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,210
questions is okay what does that cover

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,159
how does that cover me how much

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,629
disclosure is required am i in a

00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,450
competitive position where I am trying

00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:46,000
to donate some things but keep other

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,429
processes outside of my donation so that

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,279
they can be my competitive advantage if

00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:52,360
you read the old shapiro and Varion book

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,299
information rules

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,379
it talks richly about how the way to

00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:00,250
play the open-source game from a

00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:02,440
enterprise point of view is to figure

00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,019
out what to give away to enjoy network

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,269
effects and what to keep for your own

00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:10,029
proprietary processes everybody is doing

00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:12,250
that everybody has some things some UX

00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:14,529
some methods some algorithms some spin

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,629
some profile that's their secret sauce

00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,909
the best thing I can tell you as a

00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:21,220
lawyer to non-lawyers is going to these

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:24,100
sewing things knowing darn well what

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,330
your secret sauce is if any and what

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,100
parts of you're trying to giveaway and

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,440
get everybody else to use versus what

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,149
parts of it you or somebody else in your

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,789
environment is trying to keep for

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:36,309
themselves when you get that wrong or

00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:38,019
when you're not clear or when the

00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:40,960
organization where you're doing the work

00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,269
is fuzzy and not careful you get

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,009
problems and if those problems involve

00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:47,879
large economic risks people sue each

00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:52,210
other and bad things happen one word

00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:54,250
Rambis are a.m. B us look it up 10 20

00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,720
years ago whole series of cases about a

00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,539
standards group that fell on each other

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,399
like a pack of wild dogs because there

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:02,860
were disclosures the disclosures were

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,210
thought to be not very clear there was

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,190
an allegation that you lied to me about

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,659
your patent we didn't tell you what we

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,840
never said we didn't have one why I'm

00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:12,370
gonna sue you suit dismissed run to a

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,720
regulator regulator looks at and says

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,950
yeah it wasn't against the rules because

00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,780
the rules are crappy but it was

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:20,130
deceptive anyway you're on

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:23,740
arrests big mess so clear rules good

00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:26,740
fair clear disclosure good working in

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,810
places where they have clarity good and

00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,000
above all knowing what you're trying to

00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:34,780
protect and knowing what you want to

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,980
share so I think this eggs really well

00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:41,920
into this discussion of how IP and

00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,570
patent policies of

00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,070
different organizations sort of

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:49,600
reinforced Commons and it would think

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,510
you all were kind of touching on that so

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,900
I wonder you know you were talking about

00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,640
sort of like if if you were just doing

00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,290
your weekend project and you select MIT

00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,270
because you know everybody else is like

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,280
that's sort of reinforcing that that

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:07,240
system and can you speak to other ways

00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:09,070
in which you know our policies here can

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:17,650
help reinforce that and improve the

00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:20,050
Commons so it's not so tragic I can you

00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:24,730
know start with with one I mean so that

00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:29,760
the w3c royalty-free patent policy

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:33,510
offers a reciprocity term that you can

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,630
condition the royalty-free promise on

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:40,540
everyone else's promise to make their

00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:43,600
patents available on the same spec on

00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:46,090
the same terms so that and that

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,550
reinforces the the Ostrom principle of

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,770
community having a defined community

00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:56,230
those who are in and who are willing to

00:34:50,770 --> 00:35:00,130
commit to of sharing the the the work of

00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,160
keeping this open get the rights to your

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,620
work as well and those who want to

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,020
freeride who want to take but not give

00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,210
well they face the the risk of

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,360
litigation by any one of the

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,360
participants who is otherwise making

00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:20,050
that their patents available

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,990
royalty-free and so it's it's a you know

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,580
anyone is free to enter so long as

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,910
they're willing to to make that

00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,370
commitment and that's a little

00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,580
lightweight community bow

00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:35,440
Guri that says here are the conditions

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,050
here are the rules that you need to

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,430
agree to if you want to be part of this

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:45,370
commons and and that helps to you know

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:48,850
build the the spirit of good faith

00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:57,490
interaction and cooperation that then

00:35:48,850 --> 00:36:00,550
can grow the commons yeah i mean there's

00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:04,530
so many this is a tough one to impact so

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,760
let me also give one example right so

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:10,420
there some of you may be aware that

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,610
there's there's a couple different ways

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,150
that you can say what the license on a

00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,410
code is for a long time the default was

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,050
i'm just gonna have a file called

00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,480
copying and I'm gonna put the license in

00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,310
there and that's gonna be good enough

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,680
right and then some large corporations

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,410
got involved or like that still makes us

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,600
a little nervous because we don't have

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:34,510
we you know say Joe Schmoe comes along

00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,860
and gives you know submits a pull

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,310
request we didn't call them pull

00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:42,820
requests but you know I you know submits

00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:47,140
pull requests have they agreed to those

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:48,460
legal terms in that in that one file how

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,020
do we know that they've how do we know

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,600
that their employer has agreed to those

00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,690
terms right so one of the first early

00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,130
evolutions in open-source licensing was

00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,460
something called a contributor License

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:02,170
Agreement where when a new contributor

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,160
would come in off the internet and say

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:08,080
hey I have an idea here's here's a patch

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,990
everybody would the gears would grind to

00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:16,810
a halt and everybody would say hey that

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:18,730
looks great please fax me this this da

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:22,510
please print it out and fax it to me or

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:24,700
certified mail also fine and we will

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:28,420
literally put it in a filing cabinet at

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:30,250
the Apache Software Foundation and and

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,640
we'll keep track of it just in case

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:38,220
right and in fact I'm aware of a

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,090
situation this is this is semi-public

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,670
given my track record you can probably

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,619
guess who it is here but

00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,049
I've been aware of a case where a

00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:48,299
company sued over a piece of code and

00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:50,160
the Apache Software Foundation opened up

00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:52,049
their file cabinet and said but you gave

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,640
us this piece of code it says right here

00:37:52,049 --> 00:38:00,780
you gave it to us and the company backed

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,270
down right and so it wasn't a like

00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,730
purely hypothetical well here's the

00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:08,280
thing I have been doing this for 20

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:11,309
years now and I've aware of exactly one

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,230
case in which that has been helpful and

00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:15,869
there are literally thousands of these

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:25,460
things on file if not tens of thousands

00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:28,319
right okay you know deep competition

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:32,670
that's not a real thing by the way no

00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:34,770
chase has doesn't I think you guys do I

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,839
mean you guys do it as you know bites

00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,059
set in a github register at the moment

00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:43,920
but you got clas it's just that they're

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:45,270
not we don't fax them anymore but at

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,369
some point somebody said hey you know

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,900
what in most of these cases the original

00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:51,960
things were written such that you could

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,180
literally like if some random Schmo off

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,470
the internet came submitted a patch and

00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,480
it turns out they were lying about the

00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:59,670
source you could sue them about it which

00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,119
was like nice in theory but in fact as a

00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,220
practical matter you know none of us are

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,160
what we would what lawyers call deep

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,339
pockets right we're not like if Oracle

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,140
wants to like hubzu Joe Schmoe Oracle's

00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,569
gonna realize like the cost is not worth

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,130
like the benefit here right because they

00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:20,430
are gonna spend a lot more lawyers than

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,440
whatever Joe Schmo has in his pockets to

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,599
give to Oracle right the Oracle

00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:30,119
vindictive sons of but you know

00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:35,490
they're not Donna former client but I

00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:37,290
still have thoughts so we so a lot of so

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,510
a lot of communities were a little

00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,700
concerned about this overhead of first

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,970
faxing you know now it's github stuff

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,190
but and so somebody said you know what

00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,230
look we're not gonna go ahead and sue

00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,450
this person why don't we optimize that

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,819
out and we'll focus on instead simply

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,960
being able to to notify people hey you

00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:56,849
should really Oh

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,910
and own this before you give it to us

00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:03,210
and we should know who gave it to us

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,609
right and that is where you got the

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,800
developer certificate of origin the key

00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:10,829
point being there we know where it came

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,240
from so that if somebody Sue's us we can

00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:15,210
look into it

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,000
and we can take that code out if we need

00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:21,140
to right and that's where a DCO comes in

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,089
which is the default I believe for open

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,970
projects are actually on different like

00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:29,970
things and so that that's that's part of

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:31,619
this new policy as a new foundation is

00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,890
like okay can we start to figure out

00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,660
like what the standard practice ought to

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,430
be among 30 some-odd projects that have

00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,869
been doing it differently for a number

00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,970
of years and this is a great

00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:43,619
illustration that the point the problems

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,359
that joke nodejs people have when

00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,470
designing a system like that is you had

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,849
a bunch of people coming in with a much

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,530
different licenses a bunch of different

00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:51,180
environments bunch of different practice

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,680
in terms of people who like signing

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,540
stuff and have a six pack of lawyers

00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,220
people who don't some people are

00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,290
comfortable DCOs some aren't and so you

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,720
have to construct a reasonably safe

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:03,049
process but let me try and abstract that

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,180
into an action item for non lawyers okay

00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:08,609
what this tells you is that your first

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,260
question in a development situation

00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:13,079
where you're contributing stuff you care

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,819
about into a project you care about is

00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,450
you need to decide whether you're in a

00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:20,220
relatively weasel free environment

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:22,619
because you see if you are full of

00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,960
weasels like are to be the Rambis people

00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,000
or some of Louie's clients or maybe I

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,780
should say clients opponents but your

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,780
mileage may vary

00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,910
if you're in a weasel free or a highly

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,130
competitive or a Dueling licenses

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,390
pistols at dawn environment then all

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,470
this stuff is gonna matter a lot more

00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,000
and you got a lot more chance of

00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,160
contributing a whole lot of things they

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,440
can then get swiped away from you or

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,720
overridden or your projects suddenly

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,670
been deep-six because of a lawsuit or a

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,960
threat of a lawsuit because believe me a

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,329
lot of the people dealing this are not

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,040
brave warriors they're craven if you go

00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:58,230
booga-booga I'm going to sue you they

00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,849
fold and if you go booga-booga I'm gonna

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,680
see you and you got a lot of money you

00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,480
know I mean I guess New York the Oracle

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,980
Google case on which we have no opinion

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,410
because we have been tribution from both

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,270
sides you got two rather large companies

00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,980
who are apparently not

00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,390
spending legal I mean I assumed that

00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,380
when one of them calls the other the

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,930
reaction on the other end of the phone

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,980
is oh my god stars and garbage were lost

00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:21,470
but a lot of the battles between parties

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,080
who have opposite technical or licensing

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,760
or patent positions are asymmetric this

00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,130
is not a little blank field form so

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,410
figure out how treacherous and how

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,330
weasel free your environment is and then

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,740
you will know how much you want to sort

00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,640
of run for safety and make sure that

00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,980
you're working within a highly

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,170
structured process or process to test

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,460
professional referees a process that's

00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,530
got a lot of output and has a lot of

00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,460
connections into other systems so that

00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,570
there's gonna be people running

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,760
interference for you because I can

00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,380
assure you that when something goes to

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,750
hell in a standards or open source

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,000
project at my shop or Wendy's we get

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,590
calls and we try to help them navigate

00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,320
it in some appropriate rate without

00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,480
taking sides and that can be a very

00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,150
important function so the maturity of an

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,590
organization also goes to you know when

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:08,710
that crazy thing happens can you get

00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:10,550
help an unfortunate part of our

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,670
profession is that we are all

00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:17,450
professional pessimists it is our job to

00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:19,730
see the issues coming like we are we

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,790
have finely tuned weasel radar and we're

00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,860
we see those weasels from a lot further

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,700
off than you do now sometimes they are

00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,470
imaginary weasels right and so the the

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,210
unfortunate the balancing thing here

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:33,920
right is that we sometimes have to be

00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:36,140
the ones who are delivering those bad

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,830
news of like because circumstances

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,910
change right like you know you were when

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,380
you were talking earlier about the

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,840
patent situation I couldn't help but

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,990
think when when we all got involved

00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,150
patent litigation about software

00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,370
well actually this might not be true for

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,710
you Jimmy but the software litigation of

00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:57,080
a patents patent litigation about

00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,450
software rather has come in waves right

00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,470
where it didn't for a long time we

00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,600
didn't even think that software was

00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,520
patentable and then we thought software

00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,800
was very patentable and now we're back

00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,020
to like maybe it's not very patentable

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,520
again so it feels like a little bit of a

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,330
peaceful time right now there are no

00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,390
weasels on the horizon but in fact the

00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:20,220
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:25,470
I'm not gonna call them weasels

00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:28,079
on we're being recorded hi yes there

00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:30,060
there wonderful except when they're not

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,920
and then one day you wake up and all the

00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,710
sudden software's patentable again and

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,260
all the lawyers like it's so depressing

00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,819
to me like engineers come to be full of

00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,440
all this energy it's like just help me

00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:44,579
build the thing and you're like ok but

00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,290
bad news may come you know and and you

00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:50,160
have to be the one who's sort of who

00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:54,619
bears that bad news preemptively I wanna

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,900
add that you know a lot of our long-term

00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:01,980
Wiesel radar is looking at edge cases

00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:06,060
and exception handling and litigation is

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:09,480
for the most part in software and the

00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:13,170
exception most of what we're doing is

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,700
you know not suing one another and most

00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,069
of what we're doing in standards and

00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,589
open-source is trying to find

00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:22,609
cooperative solutions because you know

00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:25,140
the web isn't going to work the node

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:27,680
software isn't going to work if it

00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,359
doesn't work together and you know

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,849
saying I'm going to sue you for not

00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,800
interoperating with me it's a pretty

00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:37,680
poor way of getting interoperability

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,400
much better to say what can you live

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,980
with what can I live with where's a

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,470
compromise that makes each of us enough

00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,630
better off that we've got a package that

00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:52,050
works we've got a standard that works

00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:54,720
we've got an API that we all agree to

00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,369
import enter to implement not because

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,400
someone comes down with a lawsuit saying

00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:01,020
thou shalt but because you know that's

00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,589
what's gonna work for our product and

00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:07,109
our customer teams and or you know

00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:10,349
collaborators I mean absolutely we're

00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:11,880
all we all have this radar for problems

00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:15,089
the best lawyers are the ones who have

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,460
the radar for problems and help you get

00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:19,980
to a solution anyway right like that's

00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,609
unfortunately I think what separates not

00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:26,099
great lawyers from great lawyers and and

00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:28,230
we're all spoken for so but like but we

00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,240
have a Rolodex so if you ever have a

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,470
lawyer saying no to you you know come

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,960
find us and we'll hook you up with

00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:37,220
somebody who will find a way to say

00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,630
you know find a way to give you answers

00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,990
all the stuff that we're doing that we

00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,250
think of as being web interface cool

00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:46,200
screens mobile all that the things you

00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,060
hear 90% of the work here talked about

00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,710
this you know that's one part of the

00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,510
world and perhaps that is a relatively

00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,180
weasel free environment as Louis

00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,770
suggests but I got to tell you I do and

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,240
I know Wendy shop is doing a lot of work

00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:02,730
in automotive in IOT in security and

00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,710
those are not at 5g good god telecoms

00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:10,320
those are not a weasel free or patent

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:11,670
free domains so I think it would be Mike

00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,750
I should say you know we just listened

00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,580
to the technical steering committee of

00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,200
nodejs earlier today and hearing the

00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,780
guys talk about all their ports of the

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,220
basic core offered all kinds of funky

00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,589
devices that aren't anything like a

00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,510
laptop you know they got a whole bunch

00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:26,550
of satellites and Lord knows what else

00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,869
running this stuff on that this o Taric

00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:31,440
chips that haven't been invented yet so

00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:36,150
we are up in that patent filled space

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,859
even here I actually think that we are

00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,160
in for a bout of copyright trolling in

00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:43,890
this space as well how many of you have

00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:49,530
actually read all the way through the

00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:54,450
BSD or MIT licenses alright okay well so

00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:56,609
I yeah I got right yeah no I'm not gonna

00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,920
read it now I will tell you that the

00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:02,130
sort of common mythology about these

00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,130
licenses is that do whatever you want

00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,710
and that is mostly true except for the

00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,330
asterisk of but if you deliver the

00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:12,570
software to somebody you've got to give

00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:17,040
them a copy of this license right now

00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:21,440
that is not not hard to do and yet

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,930
virtually nobody does it right and

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,760
somebody is going to just as the

00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,940
previous talk in this room was a part

00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,890
about people inserting deliberate

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:34,710
security vulnerabilities into people's

00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:36,540
web stacks I think we are going to see

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,030
somebody inserted liber legal

00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,430
vulnerability they're going to build a

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,380
useful library or buy a useful library

00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,869
from the copyright holder and then they

00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,410
are going to they're gonna use you know

00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:49,960
one of the scanning tools to

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:55,390
like essentially say hey I noticed that

00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:58,180
your website is using my library I have

00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:05,670
only I have never seen public record of

00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:12,400
it happening uh well I Isis there's a

00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:14,049
PICUs brief safe word you're also kind

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,730
of moving toward that last question that

00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:18,160
I was gonna ask you about predictions

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,260
but before we before we get to that I

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,520
want to make sure that we we talked

00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,380
about the other thing that I know that

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,270
this room is cares quite a bit about

00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:29,140
which is the same sustainability of the

00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:31,599
Commons and sort of the the the funding

00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,130
piece with lawyers play a big role and

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,099
sort of figuring out the business of

00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:39,039
open source as well I think everybody

00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:41,650
here cares about that and tide lifts has

00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:45,010
something to say about it yeah sure so I

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:47,109
mean so you know we have observed that

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,859
there's a lot of money floating around

00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:53,829
for really high-profile projects right

00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:55,930
and this is something that wc3 I think

00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:57,309
an oasis have seen as well if you have

00:49:55,930 --> 00:50:00,099
something that's way up at the top of

00:49:57,309 --> 00:50:01,240
the stack it is there's a lot of money

00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,760
floating around in the system right now

00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,660
it's not that hard to get funding for it

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,940
right it's not easy but it's doable

00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,770
but then you do a scan of what people

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,569
are actually using and there's literally

00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,960
hundreds of libraries that are

00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:19,809
somebody's part-time project and that

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,099
plays into questions like the security

00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:24,609
vulnerabilities that we were seeing

00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:26,349
earlier and the general just cost of

00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:29,349
using this stack right you have all

00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:31,420
spent time discovering that some library

00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:33,190
you thought you you know that you were

00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,260
relying on there's like oh this actually

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,970
hasn't been updated in four years and

00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,500
now it doesn't work with something else

00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:43,660
and you know and and we think that that

00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,789
cost of that way of doing business is

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,849
bad for developers right like it media

00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:50,619
leads to burnout it leads to abandoning

00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:52,779
projects that you once loved but your

00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:54,430
day job is now you know your day job

00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:56,950
switched from being a Java shop to a

00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:59,920
ruby shop and now your Java projects are

00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:01,240
abandoned right or you know I mean this

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,920
is obviously a JavaScript

00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,840
but you know things that we're depending

00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,840
on jQuery now everybody's moving to view

00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:11,380
or pick your flavor of the week right

00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,850
and that's that leads to a lot of costs

00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,920
for the businesses that are using it so

00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:17,110
we think that at least part of the

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,030
solution here is actually treating this

00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,190
like a business right not just a charity

00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:23,260
but actually going out and saying hey

00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,270
your business depends on this we can

00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,970
make it more reliable if we pay the

00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,520
developers who are doing the work and

00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,590
that is one approach there's many others

00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,780
right open collective is great they are

00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,980
doing the past the past the hat kind of

00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:41,050
thing there's industry consortium I mean

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,180
w3c Oasis Linux Foundation are all

00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:46,870
essentially passing the Hat at the

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:49,180
industrial scale in some sense right and

00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:52,000
and that in in certain spaces works very

00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,680
well you know tide lifts thinks that

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,560
that's not going to work for the little

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,750
for the those smaller pieces of things

00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,540
right so that's sort of where we're

00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,400
focused on oh I don't want to turn this

00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,870
into a pitch session but anybody who

00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,630
wants to talk about feel free to come in

00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:10,870
my other hat I am we're small enough

00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:13,030
that I am I am human resources I'm the

00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:17,350
general counsel and I also had our

00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:19,480
Deverell team so and so yeah so I drew

00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,150
the long straw love coming to Montreal

00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,280
in December I am the San Francisco

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,040
office no that's not true as of last

00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:31,240
week we have two people in San Francisco

00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:39,010
so let me have some fun this in throw a

00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:41,080
rock one of the ways that the balance

00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:44,050
between big and little players patent

00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:48,310
holders trolls and non-combatants and

00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:51,850
other sort of asymmetrical parties are

00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:53,770
going to be disrupted is a prediction

00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:55,270
I'm going to offer you and that is this

00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,460
by the fact that everybody makes fun of

00:52:55,270 --> 00:53:00,220
it and it's but if the fact that all

00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,800
these fat old cysts white guys like me

00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:05,530
who runs some of the older organizations

00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,290
seem to not take it seriously the

00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:11,710
ethical licensed people are going to

00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:13,810
prevail at some point okay the all

00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,099
software is good no matter what

00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,900
everybody can use and

00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:19,869
and I don't care if my stuff is used to

00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:22,989
jail babies people the old school open

00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:24,700
source approach that says no one gets to

00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:27,220
withhold their labor from anything no

00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,680
matter how evil that's not going to be

00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,170
the only model forever read ethical

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,190
license search the phrase ethical

00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,979
license if you're not familiar with this

00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,979
there is a growing set of what I would

00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:40,420
call new way of approaches or

00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:42,700
differences or twists on open source

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,249
licensing that basically create

00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,739
exceptions for various reasons and some

00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:49,869
of those are going to exclude some

00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:52,749
larger organizations and that's going to

00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:54,130
mess this all up that it's coming I can

00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:55,359
see it from here yeah we don't know

00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,979
what's gonna happen yet I don't know how

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,539
fast it's gonna happen but there will

00:53:56,979 --> 00:54:00,519
people be people who are willing to

00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:03,009
contribute to the commons for some

00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:05,049
purposes but not further purposes and

00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:07,150
that will also cause some kind of

00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:08,410
regrouping or segregation or set of

00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,049
conditions it will have to be cope with

00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,809
just as the GPL license was disruptive

00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:15,579
15 20 years ago and it basically landed

00:54:13,809 --> 00:54:18,430
in a field of other licenses nobody look

00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:20,079
that's it but if I use this I can't use

00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,180
anything else and oh my god stars and

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,269
garters I mean believe me the people who

00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,940
were in our jobs as as IPR lawyers for

00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:29,769
software 20 years ago almost all had

00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,239
vapors about the GPL because they

00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:32,769
couldn't figure out how to use it with

00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,269
anything else I'm not having the world

00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,979
break and it took a while for people to

00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:37,690
figure out that they're oh actually you

00:54:35,979 --> 00:54:39,999
can have modules next to other modules

00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,289
and even Moglen wrote some things to

00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:42,700
make it clear that this wasn't you know

00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:44,440
eating the entire world it was just for

00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,819
certain areas and there are ways for

00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,799
this stuff to coexist then they created

00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:50,799
the LGPL and they made it easier but

00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:53,259
there will be more perturbation in

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:55,650
licensure and more people insisting that

00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:57,969
other values be supported and that will

00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,410
destabilize the mess up some of these

00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:01,059
current relationships and power

00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:02,710
relationships which i think is going to

00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:09,430
be really interesting hopefully I

00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:11,920
retired before because I've got thoughts

00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,869
I I like love that you decided like at

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:19,029
the very end of this to open the ethical

00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:20,920
licensing can we we are kind of running

00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:26,549
low on time so I think I will ask you

00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,549
all to make your predictions for 2020

00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:33,700
I mean Jamie stole mine right now III

00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,260
hundred percent agree that that's gonna

00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,990
be you know I think the other

00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,730
interesting thing is going to be this is

00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:43,060
maybe not a 2020 thing but in the next

00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:45,030
say three to five years the the security

00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,300
presentation from sneaked guy here was

00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,160
terrifying

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,770
right nothing new would put a lot of

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,010
things together this this idea that we

00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:55,390
can write some letters in all caps and

00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,950
for those of you who have since I guess

00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,720
none of your other BSC license it says

00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:00,550
it's got this all cap section that

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,730
basically says oh yeah if you break it

00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:09,820
if it's broken hey not my problem your

00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:11,230
problem right yeah and and that's I

00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,120
think at some point that's not gonna

00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,940
hold right I think the security risk to

00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,430
the literally civilization are going to

00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:21,820
be too high and we're all gonna have to

00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,930
clean up you know and I don't know how

00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:29,290
lawyers are gonna be involved in that

00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:33,370
but I suspect we will yeah I think in in

00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:35,970
in the the doom and gloom portion of

00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:39,010
predictions I think we're seeing

00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:41,620
regulators and legislators being lots

00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:44,200
more interested in what we create with

00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:47,620
code whether that's round three of the

00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:49,870
encryption wars of law enforcement need

00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:53,680
backdoor sorry you can't build a secure

00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:58,750
backdoor build us one anyhow or you know

00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:03,760
liability for platforms and for what

00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:08,440
users post on them you may see da 230 is

00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:12,520
the the protection that platforms have

00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,730
had against being liable for you know

00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,860
what user is post yet we're more and

00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:21,040
more concerned about abuse about

00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:23,350
misinformation about harassment online

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,140
and finding the right balance between

00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:28,630
you know who takes responsibility how

00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:31,450
and what are the legal hooks for that

00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:34,300
responsibility you know how do we you

00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:37,210
know build these you know other kinds of

00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,730
communities on top of software without

00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:42,550
undermining the protections that we have

00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:44,520
for building good software

00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:49,109
as I think going to be you know a

00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:51,730
challenge of our next say five years any

00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:57,220
optimistic yeah

00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:58,750
predictions okay little light note but I

00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:01,330
think we're going to find that all of

00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:04,180
the current hyper categorized beliefs

00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:07,990
that a standard and a code module and a

00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:10,570
model and a markup and an API are all

00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,940
different things is going to fall away

00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,770
and simplify because you know what yeah

00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,450
we are in a world now where once where

00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,220
all that stuff is one transform away

00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:19,720
from another and and some of the

00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,089
transforms are canonical and bilateral

00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,680
and actually freaking work which is not

00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:24,730
where we were at four years ago so I

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,980
think we're gonna find that the output

00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,050
you create in whatever form or

00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,640
serialization happens to exist in

00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,990
whether it's a code or a spec or an API

00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,740
whatever it is we're going to discover

00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:37,270
that there's a much more uniform set of

00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,520
safe principles and methods for

00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:43,240
procuring finding these things I mean

00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:46,570
why do we find code or or score people's

00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,920
you know PR points on github using code

00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,990
but we don't do that with standards why

00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,580
are Oracle and Google spending 50

00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:53,830
million dollars arguing over what an API

00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,960
is if we're using DM things all the time

00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,609
why are we agonizing over their exact

00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,260
categorization I think some of those

00:58:57,609 --> 00:59:00,730
artificial two sinks are gonna fall away

00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,130
and it's actually going to render what

00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:04,750
we all do a lot simpler and so just as

00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,400
we used to see some of the the

00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,170
integrated development environments do

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,240
this you won't be having people hand

00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,980
code so much any stuff you'll be seeing

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,150
people creating models and then being

00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,380
able to implement them immediately

00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,300
without having to get in there like

00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,250
Keibler's elves and handcraft every

00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,619
piece of it I think as all that unifies

00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:23,050
more it will create a simpler and safer

00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:25,180
environment where a lot of these sneaky

00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:28,140
distinctions that weasels use to mess up

00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:32,020
your life will fall away

00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:34,089
we're gonna keep winning I mean I think

00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,280
that's the you know the the idea that

00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:38,530
open-source would literally take over

00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:42,970
the world in the way it has would have

00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:47,380
sounded ludicrous twenty years ago even

00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:49,210
Ted and I you know all this

00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,720
all the griping that we've got here at

00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:54,849
the table that's all that's all at the

00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,900
edges of the thing right like the core

00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:57,220
model works

00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,890
and we're gonna keep winning and that's

00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,359
still sometimes I way you know there's

00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,990
like a legal conference all the lawyers

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,819
get together

01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:06,339
Microsoft has started attending all of

01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:08,339
these with their lawyers right like like

01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:14,470
that that was sort of my big like oh

01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:16,089
this is real I think we're getting

01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:19,299
better at building communities around

01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:21,640
these around the code and communities

01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:24,760
that have values and ethics and privacy

01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:27,849
practices and other things that we value

01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,099
as well as the quality of the code and

01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:32,200
it's Interop so I think we're getting

01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:38,529
better at building you know code for

01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:41,950
good Society let's let's debate that one

01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:46,150
some other day I don't take away from DJ

01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:48,789
Khaled over there I know a foundation

01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:50,559
that I work with who was agonizing over

01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:52,960
how to create a testing in sort of a

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,730
certification program and they had this

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,289
debate that went kind of like this well

01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,390
should we just issue reference code and

01:00:56,289 --> 01:01:00,430
make everybody use it or should we

01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:02,349
create a model and require video by the

01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,390
model or should we create an API with it

01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:06,190
as a specification and spell it all out

01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,390
make everybody obey the data structure

01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:08,859
in the code because they needed wide

01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:11,140
interoperability across a whole bunch of

01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:13,839
governments for a complicated purpose or

01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:15,339
should we just set it up set up a test

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,569
client and say you know this isn't

01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,520
canonical but it's a reference of

01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:20,260
limitation and if you can talk to it you

01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,020
win and you know what their answer was

01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:25,359
actually your answer was don't care any

01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:27,490
one of those works which is my point

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,559
yeah right if we can get two agreed

01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,539
structures then you have you don't think

01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:33,160
sit up all night with the teams of

01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:34,960
lawyers worrying about the little rokoko

01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,460
technical details of how you license

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,289
this little piece of that and whether

01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,089
it's really the API or not whether it's

01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:41,559
really copyright of all or not or how

01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:43,630
the patent board should approach it you

01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:47,020
know you make this stuff simple it works

01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:48,450
and as Louis says we're open development

01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,460
is winning thank heaven

01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:54,160
well panelists if any of that happens

01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:57,400
I'll ask you about it next time at the

01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,599
next node plus Jas interactive watching

01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,529
wait wait don't tell me

01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:04,990
