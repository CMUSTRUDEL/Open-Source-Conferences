	The State of the Art in Localization - Eemeli Aro, Vincit
Speakers: Eemeli Aro
A review of the current tools, libraries and specifications available for localization and message formatting in JavaScript. Covering everything from framework-specific front-end libraries to server-side tools. What to take into account when selecting your own solutions, including integration with other languages and systems as well as the needs and expectations of translators. Noting in particular which early decisions are significant and hard to reverse later, and which are trivial to refactor later. Also briefly looking at where the current specification work is at, and where it might be going next.
