Bonjour and hello everyone can I see a

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,530
show of hands who hear things

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:18,090
chocolatine when they see this picture

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:25,279
one all right and who thinks that's very

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:27,920
clearly upon shockula alright alright so

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,810
thank you for a very first survey here

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,020
and now that we have so very clearly

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,239
separated the heathen from the civilized

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,969
ones we can move on to less

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:46,680
controversial topics when we started all

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,300
of this we had one question in mind what

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,539
are the biggest frustrations for web

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,100
developers and designers today and I

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,469
wish answering that was as easy as the

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,010
survey that we just did spoiler alert

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:05,119
it's not well Before we jump into that a

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,770
quick intro first so this is CSS grade

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,420
CSS grid is a web platform feature that

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,150
allows developers and designers to

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,400
layout the page in two dimensions

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,799
instead of just one this was the case

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,360
with floats and flexbox and this project

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,729
that I'm going to talk about it started

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:31,110
shortly in 2017 shortly after CSS grade

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:34,799
was released and CSS great was a massive

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,869
success so in Mozilla developer relation

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,549
team we asked ourselves how can we

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,420
support that more how can we get more of

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,149
these wins and how can we yeah how can

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,280
we repeat that so CSS Square was a

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,920
success there's addressed the real user

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,439
need and it shipped in all the browsers

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,689
at roughly the same time and came with

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,240
tooling again in case of Firefox for the

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:02,149
great inspector and that was seriously

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,460
awesome that's that CSS grid was

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:09,239
literally years in the making and layout

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,150
had been an issue for developers at

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,049
least since the times we

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:20,849
we abuse tables for for to implement our

00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:24,360
layouts and after the 90s so looking at

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:27,239
this we had a few questions when it's

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,159
when why did it take until 2012 to even

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,409
start addressing that problem

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,540
it was very obviously a problem even

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:37,260
before that and why did it take until

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,030
2017 to ship something and how was this

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,670
coordinated for shipping at roughly the

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,450
same time because most other things are

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,879
not and what were the roadblocks and

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,709
what were the things that were pivotal

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,409
to moving this forward so we took a step

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,200
back to see what the whole process

00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,450
looked like from Mozilla's perspective

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,329
and after interviewing numerous people

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,049
involved in the process we identified

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,129
three distinct phases there is research

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,400
there's standardization and

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,409
implementation and there is adoption now

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,349
as you can probably tell immediately

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,780
this is a very simplified version that

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,819
really smooth this out many things and

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,970
this looks like a pipeline when in

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,519
reality it's more like a loop or a loop

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,569
of loops that look back on themselves I

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,590
mean you get the idea

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:36,690
but this was good enough for us to get

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,310
started know most of us had a pretty

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,799
good idea about the adoption side of

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,750
things because that's really where I'm

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,849
the insurance and we had some idea about

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,840
the standardisation of implementation

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:54,479
phase but we wanted to know more about

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,299
the research part of this so how do we

00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,599
learn about developer pain points what

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,000
they need and what we should prioritize

00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,129
for the web platform so we interviewed

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,669
more than ten people involved in

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,319
different stages of that process and

00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:13,199
became clear that there was no formal

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,859
research really if muslim' we have an

00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:21,209
amazing team that does use a research

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:24,270
for Firefox but that's for end-users and

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,670
that's so much the case for when it

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,510
comes to developers we

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,710
don't have those resources and it's

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,080
important because at a place like

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,240
Mozilla as I said we do have limited

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,760
resources so we can't go after

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,760
everything can't just throw everything

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,680
at the wall and just see what sticks

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,050
there are some serious opportunity costs

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,460
that we have to pay when we decide to do

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,900
something because it usually means that

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,980
we cannot do something else at the same

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:58,420
time and this is what we heard from

00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,830
people about how things are prioritized

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:04,280
so when we talk to two people involved

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:08,420
in this process at Mozilla like we

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,880
haven't tried formal research like it's

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,830
all ad-hoc but one thing stood out

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,500
because every single one of them said

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,350
the same thing here we need to hear more

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,350
from developers they really stood out to

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,630
us it makes so much sense because none

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,360
of us can be really successful without

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,870
that part without having that it's hard

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,240
to prioritize the right things without

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,170
knowing about developer pain points and

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,280
it's hard to find the right solution and

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,080
it's hard to get people to adopt

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,790
something that doesn't solve their

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,360
problem or doesn't solve the problem in

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:47,270
the right way so for all of these

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,800
reasons we proposed a developer needs

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:54,470
assessment what is that exactly

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,790
it's a prioritized list of web designer

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,140
and developer needs it's a single and

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:06,280
simple tool for harsh prioritization

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:10,430
across a massive feature space and

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,770
extremely diverse populations it's

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,500
published on MBN it's not owned by a

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,850
single browser vendor so we initially

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,580
proposed this under the umbrella of the

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,580
MDM product advisory board where we have

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,740
representation from browser vendors but

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,210
also from the w3c and industry

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:33,200
stakeholders because you know as a

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,520
community we have to have at least a

00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,130
common understanding of the facts when

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,840
it comes to developer pain points or

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,660
developer needs even if you draw a

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,000
different conclusion

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:48,030
from them and finally it's reproduced

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,560
annually and this is important as an

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,490
industry we need to know whether we are

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,690
addressing developer pain points and to

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,490
understand whether we are prioritizing

00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,810
correctly we need to track things like

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,230
like their needs and pain points over

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,420
time so we can see the impact of our own

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:12,090
efforts so that's what we need to do

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:14,370
this regularly and not just once and if

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,970
you do this well we think the MDM web to

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,810
open its assessment or mvn web DNA for

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,850
short we think that it can be a voice of

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,240
designers and developers working on the

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,770
web but as I said asking developers and

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,170
designers about their needs and

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,890
frustrations is not trivial the problem

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,040
space is really vast and the audience is

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,090
extremely diverse so let me tell you a

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,110
little bit about the process we went

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,020
through for that and I'll make that

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,150
short but and I already apologize up

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,950
front because I'm not a researcher we

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,870
worked with a very talented Ellison make

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:54,780
key from pinpoint research to design the

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,160
the for the research design and to also

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,030
conduct this so I'll do my best to

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,820
channel her here yeah I'm not a

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,490
researcher so in January this year we

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,290
started this process by fielding a

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,980
survey to our production visor aboard

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:14,280
and we asked them for data that they

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,580
would use for decision-making as part of

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,070
their planning process and we then had

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,680
almost 20 in-depth interviews almost one

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,840
hour long interviews each with web

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:31,020
developers from around all around the

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,550
globe and we did that before putting the

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,530
initial version of the survey together

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,660
and that's important that's because we

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,289
wanted the survey to be rooted in the

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,620
voices of developers and designers from

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:48,720
the get-go because if he had run with

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,950
with what browser vendors wanted the

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,480
questions would have been based on the

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,490
internal perspective of browser vendors

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,500
by conducting the interview

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,029
we made sure to derive the survey

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
questions from the stories of developers

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,940
and designers but what was important to

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,430
them in their work but also what caused

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,990
them frustrations and so to go from

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,490
interview findings to the surveys you

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,350
follow up in points analysis process

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,520
going from observations that's what we

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:17,490
heard and saw to insights what it means

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,440
really two critical themes that's what

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,540
matters and we're continuing that

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,310
process incorporate the survey findings

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,800
into what we learned from the pilot

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,980
interviews so in practice that means we

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,560
transcribed 16 hours of interviews we

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,930
then coded them and we finally bucketed

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,250
them to derive insights for the items in

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,399
our survey that's a very hands-on

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,950
approach but based on these themes we

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,620
constructed this central survey question

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,990
around the frustrations of developers

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,640
and designers we then continue to work

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,310
with our product advisory board on the

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,620
overall survey with pilot interviews

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,140
where we watch multiple people or take

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,550
the survey at every iteration to really

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,970
ensure that survey questions would be as

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,830
unambiguous as possible it with the help

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,810
of more than 30 stakeholders from

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,690
various and the MPA B member companies

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,459
we have put together the final version

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,300
of the survey and was fielded in July in

00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:15,420
August of this year we feel it in the

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,920
end but not just an MD n also through

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,520
the channels of a product advisory board

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,240
members that's a w3c that Google

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,220
Microsoft Samsung and took through we

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,610
didn't do that just in English we

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,950
localized a survey into eight languages

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,740
that's a red big simplified Chinese

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,620
English French Japanese Korean Brazilian

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,300
Portuguese Russian and Spanish I'm very

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,839
happy to announce that after fielding

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,450
the survey for four weeks more than

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,490
76,000 people took us up on it and more

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:52,620
than 20,000 developers completed the

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:56,430
full 20 minute survey and that that was

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,730
in 173 countries total so just for the

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,670
completed complete responses alone

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,950
that's more than 10,000 hours of time

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,139
contributed by the community to help us

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,569
understand what their pain points and

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:12,509
needs are and we believe that makes the

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:14,429
mdn web DNA the biggest web developer

00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:18,329
and designer focused survey so ever

00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:21,509
conducted and with that scale can

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,660
benefits so we can segment that data by

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:27,209
experience level developer role country

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,089
satisfaction and we still can get useful

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,169
information out of that

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:35,999
so after this intro you might be

00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:38,910
interested in the actual results yes I

00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:41,009
mentioned we had participants from 173

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,529
countries across the globe but of course

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,389
that's not uniformly distributed so you

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,429
can see that just six countries here

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,669
make up more than half of the

00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,249
participants and it's the US China

00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,389
Russia India Germany and France it's a

00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,540
little bit surprising because we didn't

00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:00,329
even translate the survey into German

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,059
yeah that said we still have a pretty

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:06,899
good representation from Europe Asia and

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:09,449
North America but especially the Africa

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,419
we can really do better hopefully next

00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:15,319
time where we just got 2% of our

00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,319
responses this year

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,569
so one segmentation we were interested

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,100
in was developer types there is this

00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,399
there's of course the classic split

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,279
between front-end back-end but recently

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,350
people have started talking about front

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,879
of the front end and like back off the

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,829
front end there is no generally

00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,919
understood term for this we really try

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,869
to find one so in the end we asked

00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,279
whether people used primarily JavaScript

00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:50,100
on the front end or CSS and HTML that's

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,069
what most people understood and this

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,649
expected given our audience only a small

00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:59,970
number of people saw themselves as

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:02,369
back-end developers and we had curiously

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,079
and even split between mostly and even

00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:10,289
split between JavaScript and CSS plus

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:14,480
HTML but we had way more people

00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,480
considering selves full stack developers

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,940
in terms of experience or industries of

00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:23,340
course growing at an incredible pace

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,740
so it shouldn't be too surprising that

00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,840
one-third of all participants at less

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,720
than three years of experience and

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,730
almost two-thirds of all participants at

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,820
five years of experience or less and

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,670
speaking about representation from

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,200
previous surveys who were aware that we

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,510
would have to make an extra further than

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,390
a special effort to get better gender

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,770
representation and we did do that but

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,040
unfortunately we didn't fully succeed

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,590
for that so women participated at a rate

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,530
of between 8 and 12 percent in our

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:01,830
survey and unfortunately there are no

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,930
global general population numbers when

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,650
it comes to software development but we

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,190
know from us numbers that women are

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,990
represented at about 20% in software

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,690
development and that's clearly not what

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,060
we've achieved here so that is a clear

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,470
bias in our survey and it's when we want

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,980
to better account for in future

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,800
iterations of this but for now we want

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,390
to at least acknowledge the bias and we

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,630
also asked you that that you take that

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:35,070
into account when interpreting the

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,530
results all right that was the

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,630
demographic breakdown but what about

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:45,600
actual results so that's further ado

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:49,500
here they are all 28 needs from biggest

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,310
frustration to least frustrating and I

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:58,740
want to draw your attention to the top 5

00:14:53,310 --> 00:15:01,710
and the bottom 5 so I'll talk a little

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,910
bit more about the top 5 and top 10 in a

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:08,240
moment but when we look at the bottom 5

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:13,200
there are some surprises at first glance

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,470
in particular number 24 making sites

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:20,010
accessible people who have worked on

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:24,480
this know that there are many

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:28,080
frustrations involved with that so why

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,760
is it ranked solo and from our

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,430
interviews we think it's because

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,379
accessibility is usually deprioritized

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,269
and

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,449
developers who don't get to spend time

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:41,689
on it never notice the issues that are

00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:44,749
inherent in that work and that example

00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:48,079
should make clear that context is super

00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:50,509
important when interpreting results so

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,689
this is a quantitative study you can

00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,629
answer what and how many by I can't

00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:58,729
answer why and that's why we did the

00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:02,739
in-depth interviews to get the context

00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:02,739
which is also part of our full report

00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:09,739
let's focus on the top ten a bit more

00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:13,429
one thing you might have noticed is that

00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:19,549
four of the top five items are in this

00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:22,759
similar bucket its web compatibility and

00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:25,309
interoperability one of the biggest

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,869
strengths of the web is that there is no

00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:31,029
single entity controlling the the

00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:33,169
platform but that does not come for free

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:35,539
web developers and designers are

00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:38,509
frustrated by not being able to use

00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:41,869
features by having to work to find

00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:44,269
workarounds for things by having to

00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:47,179
fiddle with browser differences and by

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,669
the difficulty to verify that something

00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:52,749
that works in one browser will not break

00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,749
in another browser

00:16:54,729 --> 00:17:00,350
there is another bucket here though it's

00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,079
less clear-cut but it shouldn't be too

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,629
surprising especially at this conference

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,379
the web is not just HTML CSS and

00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:08,360
JavaScript

00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:11,389
it's the ecosystem of libraries and

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,909
frameworks and tools as well and there

00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:15,409
is no standard library for the web the

00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,870
original default way to build web

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,970
applications on the web and that again

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,980
comes with app sites and some very

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,129
specific drawbacks that manifest here in

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,769
these frustrations documentation and

00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:29,409
sample code is almost always a top

00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:32,269
priority for web developers and

00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:34,129
generally all developers really but

00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:37,850
handling multiple frameworks and keeping

00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:39,259
up with the ever changing landscape is

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,450
something that developers find

00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,450
frustrating at a very high rate

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,860
I mentioned before that one benefit of

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,620
large numbers or large number of

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,420
participants really is that you can

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,010
slice the data and get more useful

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:01,720
results there is one such segmentation

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,320
the top top five frustrations between

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,350
some of the top countries in the survey

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:13,020
and you will notice that there is very

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:15,850
little variation between those countries

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:20,170
despite those being very different

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:28,780
markets but they all share the same top

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:31,060
frustrations and as you know the space

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,640
the pace of change on the web is

00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,550
incredible so we asked people what their

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,340
biggest barrier for entry was when when

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,170
it came to new technologies or when when

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,380
tech becomes available new tech becomes

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,900
available and the results very much they

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,670
match the frustrations we talked about

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,470
earlier interoperability and

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,110
documentation are the leading issues

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,870
when it comes to why people might not

00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:00,430
jump on some new tech there is something

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,290
to keep in mind and so far we've talked

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,890
about what is available and causing

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,900
issues but we were equally interested in

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,300
what it is that people felt was missing

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,180
from the web so we asked what are the

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,980
things that you would that you would

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,070
like to be able to do on the web but

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,680
like web platform features to do and we

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,830
had a massive long tail of a wish list

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,310
as you can see here represented by the

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,950
other other category with 2% of mention

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,230
see each and on the other hand the

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,380
biggest category by far is about access

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:40,870
to underlying devices USB Bluetooth

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:43,060
camera SMS and all kinds of sensors we

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,970
broke out access to the file system as

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,460
its own category that you can see here

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,410
as the biggest request within that

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,420
larger access to art per category and

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,000
then a similar vein developers want

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,890
access to native api's so for contact

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,140
list calendars and other

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:02,500
features of the underlying operating

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,140
system and of course we'll notice once

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,080
again browser compatibility is very high

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:11,380
on the wishlist because what good is a

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,190
feature that is standardized and shipped

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,590
in a browser if you can't use it because

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,850
it doesn't reach that threshold of

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:25,540
availability so I know that this was a

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:28,270
bit bleak so before we finish I have

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,860
some good news we wanted to have one

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,020
measure that would help us understand

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,650
what the current sentiment is among web

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,940
developers and designers so we asked how

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,430
would you rate your overall satisfaction

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,160
with the web as a platform and set of

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:47,740
tools to enable you to build what you

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,170
need or want and a full 76 percent are

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,810
either satisfied or very satisfied and

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,140
only nine percent are dissatisfied or

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:58,810
very dissatisfied so well there is room

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,200
to grow the web is really an amazing

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:04,390
platform indeed and by understanding

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,760
what what what developers and designers

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,850
spend their time on and identifying

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,040
their biggest frustrations we can focus

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,580
our attention on those and help make

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,170
things even better than they are today

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,910
which is what I'm very happy to share

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,310
some of the responses we got from

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:27,100
browser vendors in response to the

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:29,980
survey so Google came out with a very

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,930
strong endorsement and I want to thank

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,580
the team for that they said the Google

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,790
web platform team is now using developer

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,910
satisfaction that's the measure from

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,820
just before that they're using that as

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,170
one of our top level success metric we

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,930
were excited to be using the MDI web

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,310
PNAS one of the main sources of data to

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,700
help us understand and prioritize the

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,090
key areas of developer frustration we

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,680
sure

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,470
we shared an earlier version of this

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,660
report at t pack in September and was

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,690
very well-received by the w3c which

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,880
makes me very hopeful and not

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,880
surprisingly Mozilla is on board as well

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,840
what they said was in the Firefox team

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,220
we are always listening to our

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,410
community's needs in order to make to

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,750
make product decisions and the

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,850
comprehensive overview of the developer

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,880
communities needs provided by the MD and

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,190
DNA report is therefore absolutely

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,000
essential to us and we are already in

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,220
cooperating its findings in our plans so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,990
what I just presented and much more will

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,510
be in the full report that we intend to

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:40,270
publish this year still you know it's

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:41,470
already the 12th but very soon and we

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,750
will make it freely available to

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,100
everyone I want to thank all of our

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,160
product advisory board members for their

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,870
support here and we invite everyone to

00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,420
use the results to shape their roadmaps

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,770
to better reflect the needs and pain

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:58,420
points of developers and and what

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,720
developers expresses their frustrations

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,880
but as I said we want this to be an

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,280
annual thing so the next iteration will

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,140
start in March 2020 we will feel to

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,890
survey in May and will publish the

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:15,690
results in September 20 2004 in time for

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:21,870
