	Will React Hooks Replace Redux? - Trivikram Kamat
Speakers: Trivikram Kamat
React Hooks let you use React state and other React features without writing a class. In this talk, we will go through an application which uses Redux for State management, and modify it to use Hooks. While doing this, we will understand the different types of problems Hooks solve, and what improvements we can expect in future.
