	Oh No! The Robots Have Taken Over! - Christopher Wilcox, Google
Speakers: Christopher Wilcox
As part of his work, Chris and his team at Google are responsible for managing libraries for 150 APIs across 7 languages. This results in a crushing amount of toil, making it hard at times to both make forward progress and maintain what has been created.
