Title: Bringing JavaScript to the IoT Edge - Joe Karlson, MongoDB
Publication date: 2020-05-11
Playlist: Node + JS Interactive 2019
Description: 
	Bringing JavaScript to the IoT Edge - Joe Karlson, MongoDB
Speakers: Joe Karlsson
The number of IoT devices is expected to be around 18 billion by 2022 and be a market of over $500 Billion. Edge computing is becoming an even bigger requirement. As a versatile language, JavaScript is in a great position to power many of these devices. This session will explore why and where JavaScript is being used in this industry segment and specifically the role that Node.JS plays in the Internet of Things.

Data collection in the IoT arena comes in fast and from a variety of sensors and devices. How to model that data is important for analysis downstream. Weâ€™ll also take a look at some different schema design patterns to think about when storing the data in a modern database, like MongoDB

okay I'm just gonna get started here

00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,760
people are gonna be wandering in that's

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,530
totally okay but this is bringing

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,139
JavaScript's the IOT edge let's get

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,150
started first of all I just want to kind

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,070
of whet your palate a little bit I get

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,940
y'all excited about the topic so why

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,439
does this matter

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,130
why are we learning about IOT why are

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,590
you here you've probably seen this graph

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,300
before but IOT is growing and will

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,220
continue to grow I do want to put a

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,510
little asterisk here I think that IOT

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,890
has probably been a little hyped and I

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,600
don't think it's gonna be it's like

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,710
we're not seeing the growth quite that

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,030
way but I think that IOT is still

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,379
massive and I think it's still we're

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,829
still in the Wild West days trying to

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,390
figure out what what the hell it is

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,530
we're early this is early we're early in

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,300
on that too

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,670
and JavaScript is a massive part of the

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,649
IOT ecosystem so the more you know great

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,920
so my name is Joe Carlson I work for

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,230
MongoDB and I'm a developer advocate

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,149
those are my socials best way to get a

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,500
hold of me is actually on Twitter so

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,159
feel free to go there otherwise all my

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,770
social stuff is on my website opinions

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,220
are my own if I say something or swear

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,890
something it's not my company it's me

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,970
and lastly I'm gonna be posting this

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:24,210
link a lot but all the resources I post

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,479
in here including the slides all the

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,150
other links additional resources links

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,259
or this recorded session went to the

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,310
code link to videos all be on that page

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,079
so feel free to check that out I'm just

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,640
gonna wait here for a second so people

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,380
can take photos that people were taking

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
photos if that's too small to take QR

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,159
photos of that it got it cool awesome

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,479
even the back of the room got it that's

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:53,310
that's good though I'll be posting this

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,930
more yeah okay a little bit more about

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,950
me too let's see how well I see people

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,950
still taking photos too

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,390
cool I will be posting slinky or at

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,080
least this QR code again - so a little

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,410
bit more about me

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,140
I love IOT and most of my projects that

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,690
I do in my own are hardware related in

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,670
some some way this is a magic mirror I

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,230
put together it's a smart mirror you can

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,910
see does whether my currently playing at

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,250
Spotify some positive affirmations and

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,470
York Times headlines calendar updates

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,300
weather whatever

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,880
it's actually I didn't make it it's part

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,650
of a magic mirror mirror squared project

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,080
you can find more about that down there

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,030
you choose it electron I did make this

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,700
recently it's called mood light those

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,320
are 3d printed panels and LEDs in the

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,630
corner and I have a little web app or a

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,459
little web server built into the little

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,160
triangles anyone your heard of Nana

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,510
Leafs before they're big they're super

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,630
expensive you've probably seen if you

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,340
ever googled it I decided I want to pay

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,500
$300 for nine of them so I just made my

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,790
own but you can control the lights from

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,070
that web server running from those

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,950
panels and you can learn more about that

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,510
down there okay

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,890
so before we get started and get into

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,750
the nuts and bolts for this I want to

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,110
first just thank you all for coming

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,600
I sincerely appreciate it I don't know I

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,160
have a cool job where I get to make cool

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,900
 and travel around and talk to

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,950
people and it's because of you guys come

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,870
in these talks so I just really

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,000
appreciate it you know I think thank you

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:32,410
for being here and who's this talk force

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,450
this is gonna be for people who are new

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,420
to JavaScript or new to have some

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,549
JavaScript experience maybe be new to

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,350
IOT this is more of a kind of 101

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,970
introductory stuff we're not going to be

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,500
getting into nitty gritty about security

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,030
we have 30 minutes so we're gonna kind

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,310
of book it through here but most

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,860
importantly even if you're like IOT

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,570
expert great like or none of the above

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,390
you know do JavaScript you're still be

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,380
fine this talk is still for you I'm

00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,540
hoping you'll still get something new

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,640
out of it too but great I want to get a

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,090
quick poll and just get a quick pulse on

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,950
where y'all are at so who here has IOT

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,620
experience like done a little bit maybe

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:15,280
mess around Raspberry Pi before

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,079
cool cocoa cool like quarter half ish

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
and then JavaScript experience assume

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,220
everyone in the room great okay cool

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,200
cool and again here's that linked where

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,450
all the resources can be found too so I

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:32,950
think everyone's want to get it yeah

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:34,330
I'll hold this up one more time I just

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,020
added these yesterday cure code that's

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,700
so smart

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,350
I saw someone talk yesterday with some

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,460
of that your code so links and like that

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,950
it's so genius

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,280
hey let's quickly added a bunch into my

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,690
talks but okay so roadmap what do we

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,100
need what's the stock in OLAP like today

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,530
I'm gonna do a quick introduction IOT

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,600
what it is what I love about it we're

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,520
talking about JavaScript and node and

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,860
IOT and why you should be considering

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,990
using them for your next IT project I'm

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,850
going to talk about some data practices

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,919
I'm in MongoDB developer advocates so

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,540
it's kind of I'm gonna be okay I think I

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,300
have to talk about data a little bit

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,620
with it so which is cool actually and I

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,520
didn't know a lot about this too so I

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,350
hope you learn a little bit there too

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,410
and then I want to talk about a real

00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,690
project so I've been working on it I

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,160
it's a smart kitty litter box in my free

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,830
time I've actually been stringing on

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,479
twitch so we going over that project in

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,430
particular and then lastly we're talking

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,479
about my predictions for where IOT

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,330
something going in the future right so

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,630
what the heck is I oh t it's basically

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:38,490
anything that has that connects up to

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,919
Internet and by thing I mean anything

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:45,280
it's the future we're seeing that stuff

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,270
like right smartwatches fitbit's I think

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,270
the part that people don't consider with

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,400
with IOT is like automation especially

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,740
with like that manufacturing smart

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,330
plants connected devices but I think we

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,310
see the consumer products quite often

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:06,419
and think about those being IOT projects

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:10,360
my personal personally I'm interested in

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:12,190
two parts of IOT I love the stupid

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,620
have you ever anyone see the Twitter

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,280
account Internet of where people

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,220
make like like toaster ovens that

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,349
connect to the oven or or like toilets

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,750
like I'm putting together here I think

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,070
we don't know exactly what it's capable

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,150
of yet so we're just putting chips and

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,750
everything and kind of figuring out

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,270
what's

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,420
someone doesn't I can love that actually

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,220
I ran a hackathon in Hawaii called the

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,170
stupid and terrible ideas hackathon

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,130
I was inspired by another hackathon it

00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,510
got started in New York City I love I

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,790
love that fine line between just a

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,550
stupid idea and a kind of a genius idea

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,900
I think that's worth I love I just I

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,040
love that I think that's great and I

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,410
think there's a lot of room there for us

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,980
to kind of play around in IO team the

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,360
other part I really like too is art

00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,850
whenever I travel the cities I always

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,070
try to go to Newark Museum I personally

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,100
think that the people in this room you

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:08,170
are we're uniquely positioned to explore

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,240
this new area of art I think a lot of

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,760
humanities and artists don't know a lot

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,760
of programming but I think that like

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,720
that's where we're at like there's a lot

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,710
there's a lot of exploration that can be

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,020
done there I think with the internet

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,390
connected art I just love that I love

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:27,090
where we're going with that so IOT so

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,100
IOT is anything you put a chip in it and

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,040
IOT is exploding and I love art and

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,640
stupid with Internet programming

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,650
chips in it so great okay that was a

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,790
fast version I had to kind of give I had

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,440
to trim this up because we have 30

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,840
minutes so we're we're going to doing

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,990
the fast version here today but okay so

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,690
I think this is the part that were that

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,990
you'll care about it's uh why should you

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,640
be using javascript and IOT with your

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,560
next IOT project

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,790
well first of all did you know I think

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,320
actually the node foundation who runs

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,300
this conference they did a study and

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,979
they found that actually over 50% 50% of

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,100
IOT developers self-identify as no

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:13,150
developers it's the primary language IOT

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,530
is being developed in today personally

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,660
this is an opinion but I think

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,950
JavaScript's a great language for new

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,290
debt new developers so if you're new to

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,840
programming right I think it's a great

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,479
choice as opposed to like C or C++ which

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,330
are that like there are advantages that

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,070
memory Y space wise performance wise but

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,570
low level languages I think can be

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:36,520
difficult you learn I personally I

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,620
program in C and C++ and I prefer

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,380
JavaScript every time it's just easier

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,520
and more fun I'm more comfortable fit

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,280
especially if you've never done and

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,410
tea project like learning the hardware

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,640
is already like kind of a step you have

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,870
to learn and like learning a new

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,790
language is on top that's kind of

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,780
challenging too I just use what you know

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,430
you know other thing that why javascript

00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,290
is really popular is it's super easy to

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,580
update so you can just have a command

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,920
that goes out to all of your sensors on

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,040
the field and tell to do a git pull an

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,870
NPM install and boom you're updated with

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,240
like C or C++ traditionally you have to

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,640
reflash those chips with the new

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,840
hardware or with the new software excuse

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,100
me that can be expensive and

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,340
time-consuming and challenging to do

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,750
over a network remotely and tell the

00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,510
internet really speaks JavaScript we're

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,280
already communicating on the net why

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,820
can't we communicate with IOT projects

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,380
also with JavaScript there's a ton of

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,270
libraries actually it's been around I've

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,510
been actually developing an IOT and

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,800
JavaScript for years now and there's

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,570
it's pretty mature it's a pretty mature

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,870
platform the two big ones right now our

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,150
Cylon Jas may know that from Battlestar

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,980
Galactica or johnny-five from the

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,400
nineteen eighty-something movie short

00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,990
circuit I'll be going over I built my

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,180
Liberty but litter box using johnny-five

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:59,680
we'll be going over code samples with

00:09:52,180 --> 00:10:00,310
that today okay and also note in

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,130
JavaScript

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,360
it speaks events it's event-driven we

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,920
use callbacks to kind of handle

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,590
callbacks of promises the handle events

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,730
right we have some sort of event trigger

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,010
some callback to handle it

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,360
that's basically how I you t-works we're

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,130
waiting for something to happen and we

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,840
want to do something so for example

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,320
maybe I have a moisture sensor and it's

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,060
waiting for the like a water event to

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,040
happen on that sensor and we want to do

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,720
something with that we want to analyze

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,940
it and send it off to our centralized

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,740
server cool or we have a light sensor

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,970
that's waiting for it to get dark we

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,410
want to trigger some sort of callback

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,780
function to happen when that event gets

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,790
triggered javascript speaks that lane

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,450
the language of physical hardware

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,920
already it's it's it works it works just

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,380
fine it's that's how we're building it

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,090
anyways it's native and if that's

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,010
helpful because it helps reduce the cost

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,780
of listening it makes it more power

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,670
efficient instead of having to do work

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,900
all the time we just do work when Advent

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,760
gets triggered all right so

00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,290
recap why should you be considering

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,250
JavaScript and node for u n-- x io t

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,100
project 58 of 58% of IOT developers

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,420
already self-identified as no developers

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,520
it's super easy for new developers learn

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,020
C and C++ great for a lot of reasons

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,140
there are reasons why you would want to

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,510
use those for a project but I would

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,610
argue javascript is a great it works in

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,690
it's great anyway so super easy update

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,220
over network you want to reflash

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,240
anything just get pull in payments done

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:28,510
done and it already speaks JavaScript

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,860
super mature platform and javascript is

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,480
an adventure of a language which is

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:37,360
natively how physical hardware works

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,860
well all right any questions so far

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,460
we're doing good on time

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,300
great ok I want to make a little note

00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,350
about my personal philosophy on

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:53,050
technical talks

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:55,590
I love having real projects in my at my

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,140
talks I think it makes kind of abstract

00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,730
examples more concrete however there's a

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,380
fine line have you guys been to talks

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,410
before where the whole thing is just

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,110
code and then you lose track and your

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,520
eyes kind of glaze over I have that like

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,870
all the time

00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,520
or if I like stop paying attention for

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,960
like two seconds and I get toy loss and

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,790
then the rustic talk I have no idea

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,320
what's going on I'm trying to bet find a

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,770
balance there between like making it

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,690
like less abstract but not have every

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,010
one plays out so we do do a little bit

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,300
of actual code we're not going to be

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,980
doing a deep dive anything today though

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,050
we have 30 minutes again we're gonna

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,880
kind of go into it though if you do want

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,940
to go into it deeper I will be available

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,250
after the talk on Twitter or like I said

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,390
all the code will be on my thing I will

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,700
be posting all the stuff to my Twitter

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:43,120
as well so great you're great it's

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:46,480
already mentioned I'm a I'm a mom good

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,980
to be employee so the question I always

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,980
have to ask is how do we deal with this

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,860
data I want to come at this from an

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,470
angle of what you should be considering

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,830
if you're if you're choosing a database

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,390
to store IOT data so first thing you

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,610
should be considering is a database

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,210
needs to ingest data quickly so imagine

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,070
I'm running a I have a moisture sensor

00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,460
farm out at I farm right I have a bunch

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,620
of

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,630
little sensors out measuring the

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,340
moisture of my crops maybe have a

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,960
thousands of them and all thousand those

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,370
data of those IOT sensors are

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,650
transmitting data back to my centralized

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,480
database all at the same time I need a

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,970
database that's gonna be able to handle

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,400
massive concurrent data which we see a

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,140
lot with IOT projects especially as he

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,089
starts scaling up right a home hobby

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,800
project like my eye a kitty litter box

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,770
great can handle one just fine but what

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,610
happens if I start monetizing this and

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,930
manufacturing and deploying you know

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,730
millions these out in the fields like

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,170
you need a database that's gonna be able

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,550
to handle a constant stream of data just

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,830
a mass amount of concurrent data coming

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,110
in all the time so definite sitter that

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,170
you want a database that is a venturi of

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,730
it remember we talked about how

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,870
JavaScript and IOT speaks the adventure

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,360
of the framework or you also want a

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,250
database that can handle events and can

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,520
be read in or write based on events

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,839
coming in from the field flexible schema

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,050
is also something I would strongly

00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,150
consider as well so a super common

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,250
example of IOT projects is upgrading or

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,010
adding additional sensors so for example

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,770
recently we'll be getting a little bit I

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,870
added a switch sensor on the door of my

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,920
litter box to tell when I was going into

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,620
maintenance mode or when I was opening

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,490
it to clean it it was super easy for me

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,570
to add that additional sensor data to my

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,860
my database I didn't have to do anything

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,089
had to change any little data exciting

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,370
with the character like great just like

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,050
after you know March 3rd I'm just gonna

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,120
start tracking all of my additional new

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,610
sensor data not a problem not a problem

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,080
super easy so definitely consider I feel

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,150
like I owe t projects are more flexible

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:48,760
for schema than other other types of

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:50,980
projects and lastly time series data so

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,400
there's lots of there's lots of ways to

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,290
save your data with IOT project but time

00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,370
series data is probably the best way and

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,690
that's because a lot of times when

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,580
you're if you're reading or you're

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,010
saving data to a database you're

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,209
probably doing some sort of reporting on

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,430
it that's traditional what you do you

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:12,250
make some sort of admin dashboard

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:18,040
showing the data over time at some sort

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:19,810
of time period and yeah I may be biased

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,180
but MongoDB is a great choice for this

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,200
it does although some way more I'm going

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,340
to be going into a little

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,410
it's just briefly how to do how I

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:33,520
implemented time series data with my

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:36,280
kitty litter box today - right so IOT

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,050
data best practices what should you be

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,300
considering if you are considering

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,400
saving data for IT project you need a

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,590
database that handles massive concurrent

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,570
read rights you want a database that's a

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,680
bench ribbon you want a database I can

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:52,360
handle flexible schema oops and you want

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,610
a database that can handle time serious

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,660
what date oh well or natively right all

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,210
right easy

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,880
so IAT data best practices awesome this

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,320
is my favorite part

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,520
IOT kitty litter box so let's jump into

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:13,090
some practice of code so I built a IOT

00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,470
kitty litter box and that's my cat

00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,960
jumping on the box at the very end of

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,420
that thing but I sprang for a

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,020
mid-century modern kitty litter box I'm

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,240
aware that says extra you can buy a just

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,490
$20 thing on Amazon just a little

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,060
clothes covered thing on it no problem

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,610
but he worth it so it's a little extra

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,170
for it one of them note I want to say

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,300
about this - this project is actually

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,620
still working progress I have the MVP

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,440
done I'm still actively working on this

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,480
project if you do want to watch me

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,650
continue to work on this project you

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,510
could totally check it out I'm streaming

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,410
this weekly on the DB twitch

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,880
channel find a link to it there and some

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,140
videos of me working on actually on our

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,530
YouTube channel right now - if you want

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,000
to check that out I love this so it's a

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,040
great way to like jump in and like I

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,110
just love sir man twitch is the best so

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:12,400
you can check me out on there whoops

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:15,280
this is my cat eating my prototype slash

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
helping out I don't think you need any

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,480
perma damage and he didn't get

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,370
electrocuted which is great - right I I

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,990
have a 3d printer I print out some stuff

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:25,420
3d printers and not required for this

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,160
but I would recommend getting a

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,960
Raspberry Pi you can work with a bunch

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:34,120
of other stuff johnny-five works with a

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,190
bunch of different IOT hardware Klinger

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,160
dwee knows whatever I use Raspberry Pi

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,430
it's super

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,600
easy great you can run a full node

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,770
runtime environment on there no problem

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,040
I think it's really a great way to jump

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,810
in as a beginner the one downside it's a

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,150
credit card size but you can buy much

00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:57,560
smaller internet-connected chips these

00:17:50,150 --> 00:18:01,760
days too okay so I think it's helpful to

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,800
talk about how we can actually use the

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,810
PI and JavaScript to to interact with

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,000
the real world and that's through the

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,340
GPIO the general purpose input output

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,020
board and this is actually how we're

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,310
doing it for me and this was the hardest

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,050
part for me to grok when I was first

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,970
starting IOT projects like okay great I

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,070
get programming I get servers I get the

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,230
front end but how do I start interacting

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,750
with the real world and it's through

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,920
these pins so you can see here this is a

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,550
little prototype hooked up to a

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,580
breadboard

00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:32,780
with data flowing in and out of the GPIO

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,550
and on the on the PI there you can see

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,750
on the top row with those little black

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,430
and white wires connected up that's

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,690
where the GPIO pins on there I think

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:43,820
there's like 35 of them but the GPIO

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,640
there's two types of pins well there's

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,150
two types and power pins the first is

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,800
output so these are things that your PI

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,060
you can like send out to the world to go

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,010
do things on it

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,460
like turning a switch on and off or an

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,290
LED on and off you go out to do things

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,060
the other one is inputs reading in

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,430
sensor data from the outside world for

00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,950
example sensor data or light sensors or

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,330
weight data or whatever you're just

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:11,480
waiting for the data to come in reading

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,520
that in I have no idea what all these

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,680
pins do their unmarked on the PI and

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,730
most and most most ships in general

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,960
every time I have to interact that I

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:27,500
have to Google what they are and I say

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,880
that just to make it okay for you to

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,470
have to Google sup I don't I'm still

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,850
learning the stuff I've memorized it I

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,100
have to Google all the whole time I

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,300
don't know but when you're in it working

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,010
with it just google it people tell you

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,030
like they do this pin do whatever or

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,590
they'll give you some sort of schema

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:44,210
diagram you can like kind of copy just

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:46,760
plug it in okay cool so let's jump into

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,060
the real code here's another link there

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,060
too

00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:55,419
yeah great let's jump with some real

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,470
code I want to start from the I want to

00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,820
kind of take you through a journey of

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,910
how I put this box together from the

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,190
beginning to end so the first thing I

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,110
always do with an IOT project is

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,030
actually just getting that dang led to

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,960
blank that's the hello world of IOT

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,669
projects and you can see here this is my

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,919
demo it basically means I've initialized

00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,940
that sensor correctly and I'm

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,549
interacting with the hardware in the

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,960
GPIO correctly right just like with

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:21,280
traditional development we do iterative

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,720
developments on this thing I do one

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,190
little thing test it out make sure we're

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,780
good to go and then I can upgrade up to

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,160
the next piece this is even before I

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,080
really knew the schema and what I need

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,480
to do I just kind of set up the board I

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,549
just installed a note on the board set

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,809
it all up connect it up a diagram and

00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,190
then I tried doing it and this is what

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:39,490
the code looks like for just the hello

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,809
world for a IOT project so I'm using

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,960
johnny-five as we talked about I

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:45,610
mentioned johnny-five also is compatible

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,780
with a bunch of different boards so we

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,130
need to bring in the package for

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,370
raspberry PI's because that's what

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,470
working with we initialize that board

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,650
until it hey with johnny-five working

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,080
with a Raspberry Pi today cool get that

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:02,110
started and then we have a callback

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,520
function that is ready so when that

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,309
board has been initialized and saying

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,410
great you run that up we just tell it

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,270
which pin so we're saying on the GPIO

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,950
the 13th pin which I had to go to

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,200
Wikipedia for to find out which pin that

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,940
actually was and then we as a function

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,620
just called blank and that's it it's

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,140
super nice I'd love johnny-five said

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:26,440
super expressive it's just they have a

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,730
bunch of different sensors and it knows

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,230
how to work with them so I just have to

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,760
invoke the function than one of you but

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,850
get that hello v that's only a couple

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,980
lines of code to get the led to blink

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,450
and I can move that around I had to be

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,360
honest - I had to look up the circuit

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,320
diagram for how to hook up an LED

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,750
johnny-five of a bunch of stuff on that

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,580
- I took one electrical engineering

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,520
class in college I don't remember any of

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,900
it and I remember any of it I know this

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,429
like things with resistors I have to

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,960
Google it every time I'm just like I

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,190
want to lower the barrier of entry and

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,610
say you don't be an expert to do this

00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:00,809
stuff you can figure it out okay right

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,870
so we got our hello world working cool

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,260
let's

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:07,750
make a toilet I have a variation let's

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,930
talk where it's a IOT

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,460
but Internet of toilets so we're gonna

00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,160
we're getting we're getting into the IOT

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,630
projects here okay so how does this work

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,100
I want to go high level over how this

00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,650
like how this works we got over kitty

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,660
litter box here too and what happens is

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,120
I have a switch on it so when I take the

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,530
top off of my box it goes into

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,110
maintenance mode maintenance mode means

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:31,870
I'm either removing clumps from the box

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,510
or I'm adding more sand to it point is

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,980
though the maintenance mode tells it

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,650
allows me to figure out when I need to

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,970
recalibrate the base weight of the box

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,830
so when I put that that weight or that

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,400
close that box up again that switch

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,110
closes I say great it's either I added

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,929
or move something but I need to refigure

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:52,690
out with the base weight of that boxes

00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:55,360
and then I have to what I'm doing is

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,990
waiting for a cat-sized weight to get

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,070
added to that that new initialized base

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,860
weight after the maintenance mode it

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,820
gets added so I'm waiting for that cat

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:09,010
size wait to pop in I do a so the box

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm keeping track and passively tracking

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,170
my cat's weight so I have weight sensors

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,929
in the bottom of the box and when that

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,230
cat size weight gets added I measure his

00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,340
weight and I'm saving that to a database

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,160
he's doing some sort of business on

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,690
there and I send that data out there I

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,670
couldn't wait for I wait 15 seconds so

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,290
kind of these scratches and kind of digs

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,830
a little bit I wait for kind of chill

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,270
and then I take his weight and then once

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,280
that cat size weight leaves again I

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,440
recalibrate the box weight again and

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,390
then I wait for a new events happen

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,570
either a new maintenance mode or a new

00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,520
cat size thing I have not figured out

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,390
what would happen if a raccoon or a

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,100
possum in the box or a small dog but it

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,900
probably I would assume it's my cat over

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,550
time so but the point is I can track

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,440
things like my cats bathroom habits and

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,920
his weight over time see for sure Astor

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,090
changes with it - I haven't done this

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,800
yet but I would love to do like some

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,740
machine learning models so they predict

00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,050
my cat's bathroom habits I want to go

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:11,240
like just way too far down this rabbit

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,039
hole of Internet toilet data

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,279
we'll see what happens I haven't done it

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,450
yet okay great so that's how like how

00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:19,220
the box is working from a high level

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,960
let's dig into actually I'm building the

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,370
code up so we're doing the same thing we

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,830
did before we're initializing a brand

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,230
new johnny-five Raspberry Pi board and

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,000
then we wait for that ready event and

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:33,610
then the first thing I'm gonna do then

00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,960
is set up the maintenance mode and

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,700
lalala oh we have a switch so it's a

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,590
magnetic switch I have on the door and

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,789
just senses when it's open or closed

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,919
depending on how close that switches

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,870
together and when it's open we have some

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,059
sort of event that chap ins and I set

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,679
the maintance mode and once maintenance

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,559
happen I do that recalibration and

00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,419
whatever I need to do to so this is a

00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,940
little demo it's a little hard to see

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,110
let's see if I can figure this out I may

00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,380
need to record a new video but you can

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,850
see the switch on the side there and

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,710
just got cut off there you can see it

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,090
the sensor is sensing the open and close

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,270
events for when that door gets open to

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,279
her it's goes into maintenance mode or

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,870
not again the switch doesn't matter you

00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,399
could get most cheap ones just put it on

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,590
the side there so you pop that top off

00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,620
you need some we need some way to track

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,669
that whether it's in minutes long I

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,169
thought about other things too like a

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:22,610
physical switch if you kept like an open

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:26,120
box there's a ton of things you can do

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,190
for that does really matter but okay so

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,100
switch the codes really easy for that's

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:35,529
not too bad the interesting part is the

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:38,779
load cells so I'm using I made my own

00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:41,809
internet-connected scale that goes

00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,250
underneath the box and that's what's

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,100
measuring the weight and waiting for cat

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,179
sized things to enter the box so here's

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,510
the tricky part

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,730
I couldn't actually find any support for

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,990
these load cells that I purchased with

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,080
johnny-five so I had to get a little

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,000
creative but I still got to do some cool

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,919
stuff with node that you may or may have

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,649
played with I hadn't but let me show you

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,630
so I actually I did find a library in

00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:08,720
Python which was able to interact the

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,760
load cells this is the code I want you

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,429
to it's like doing some stuff doesn't

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,450
matter the while loop is where the

00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:16,340
interesting stuff happens so it's just

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,679
constantly it's a never-ending while

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,590
loop that's just getting away from the

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:24,390
box the important part here is that

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:28,110
prints amen so I'm actually using

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:32,070
odhh spawn child process to spin up a

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:34,680
Python process and read that data for me

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,390
which I had never done before because

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,280
the first time I did this I set up my

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,140
own Python server and then ahead sucked

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,420
up WebSockets there's just real-time

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,980
stream that data to my node service it

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,450
was like a pain the ass and like I just

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,830
start both these services and if one of

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,390
them went down the whole thing crashed

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,150
it was just a massive pain to maintain

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,540
and like frankly overkill child process

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,010
made this super super super easy to run

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,440
so the print statement is actually how

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,810
I'm sending data up to the child process

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,750
so this is the node code for our running

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:06,000
that I'm just requiring and that's that

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,920
child spawn child process code and then

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm Rick the process I'm bringing it is

00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,240
that Python code and then detach means

00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,970
it runs on a separate thread so I have

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,380
one I just do NPM start an NPM start and

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:20,220
node is responsible for starting up all

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,620
my node services and then it's just

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,170
waiting for data so we're saying on data

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,790
read it in and the way you send data

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,810
from that spawned child process is

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,300
through that print statement you just

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,800
print out the console and the parent

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,530
process my node process reads in

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,270
anything you're printing the console so

00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,710
I'm just doing that for loop every staff

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,780
a second I'm just sending that data up

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:42,720
to my parent child or my parent yard

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,540
process and then it reads it in with

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,340
that callback function and then I parse

00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,870
it in comes in a string and then I breed

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,740
it and then do some do some sort of work

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,300
with it and then you also have data and

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,190
error and a closed event to you can also

00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,650
work with you but isn't it worked with

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,600
child spawn child process this was like

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,010
the mysterious part about node I had

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,240
like not worked with yet I've worked the

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,680
streams those other stuff but I'd never

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,850
didn't spawn child process that's

00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,120
actually pretty jazz I got to play

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,800
around this a little bit to so he came

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,570
to an IOT talking maybe learned a little

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,910
something about spawning some child

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,200
processes too but it made my project so

00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,070
much more easier to put together so much

00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,190
easier troubleshoot

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,960
I love it okay so I want to give a quick

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,250
demo of how this actually works so you

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,170
can see a little bit little piece of

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,280
plywood there that's actually my scale

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,600
I just bought a piece of plywood the

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,540
load sensors are loaded to the bottom of

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,740
it I have that little caption there like

00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,540
kind of mess

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,800
can't see really anything but I'm

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,330
pressing on the board and you can see

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,730
that that data being registered

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,650
from my node project and could see the

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,290
little magnetic switch also hooked up on

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:49,860
the door over there - but the routing

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:55,880
zeroes press con I really need to record

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:58,440
a new video here you see nothing great

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,190
cool so this part was the trickiest part

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,260
but I think it's great

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,360
I do some math and some things on there

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,850
it's kind of zeroed out recalibrate

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,530
whatever but doesn't matter what it is I

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,120
just kind of whatever it that I just set

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,520
a base wait and I wait for some sort of

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:17,640
weight increase to happen okay well I do

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,080
want to talk to you about so I promised

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,490
I'd show you my time series data and how

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm actually saving the state of the

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,570
database I'm gonna post a link here on

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,549
the bottom if anyone wants 200 free

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,830
credits 200 hours and free credits to

00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:30,570
MongoDB Atlas there's a link there to

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,240
off a link at the end and there's a link

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,059
on that that page there too but I'm

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,710
saving all my data in a MongoDB database

00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,570
and this is actually what my time series

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,059
data looks like for my kitty litter box

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,460
so I have some basic metadata about my

00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,230
box what it is I built some additional

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,390
metadata in there too

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,309
I don't know in the event I start masked

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,799
manufacturing these with my Kickstarter

00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:54,660
I don't think I will but like it just to

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,520
save some data right so know who it is

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,799
or if I get more cats or whatever I can

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,610
potentially save that data and then I

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,020
have an array of events and the events

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,540
are just denoted by time stamp and a

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,010
weight and also I'm tracking things like

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,260
maintenance mode that's when a door gets

00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,580
opened so like for example I'm out of

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,100
toner now I have a row for watching my

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,350
cat I can track how many times that box

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,850
gets open while I'm on the road by

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,350
noting that the maintenance mode time

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,700
series data down there too and it's

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,590
super easy to add or update things in

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,720
there but every time an event gets

00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,669
triggered i'm just appending a thing on

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,679
here one note I will say about time

00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,210
series data the way I would recommend

00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,309
constructing it is based on how you want

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,110
to do reporting so sometimes you're

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,059
getting sensor data every half a second

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:39,840
so I want to get on record moisture data

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:42,299
sensor data from a field of every second

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,000
from a thousand sensors that may be a

00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,169
little crazy I'm doing mine by day

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,210
because I'm doing reporting like base

00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,740
Sunday how many times the bathroom is it

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,750
getting is he going in a day or how many

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,340
times I get clean today but maybe a few

00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,530
have massive data you want to do it by

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,790
minute so the event is every minute

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,470
you're creating a brand new document and

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,030
keeping track of their idea or maybe a

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,550
year maybe you're only sporadically

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,140
keeping track of it right I think with

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,820
like of a document database like this

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,790
you can be far more expressive about how

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,760
you are saving that data and the way I'm

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,320
doing it is I'm I'm saving the data in

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,080
the way I want to read it on my

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,730
analytics charts I don't have to I don't

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,350
have to do it's already pre computed I

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,480
just pull it in read that data boom it

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,620
works I want to do any weird math or

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,250
anything that I'm saving it the way I

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,810
want to read it

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:32,160
make me far more expressive okay I want

00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,640
to talk to just I want to show you like

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,820
some of the final pieces there to let me

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,020
kind of put in the whole box together

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,020
the single power file that goes in the

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,940
back can I save or stop this let's see

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,950
you can see the pie I'm just mounted to

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,260
a board on the inside there I 3d printed

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,660
out a case for it and I use some

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,600
high-tech duct tape to kind of put those

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,030
Carlo this safe make sure the cables are

00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,320
in place which is great you could see on

00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,890
the bottom a little red cable that's all

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:07,640
the sensor data coming in from the the

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:07,640
load cells okay great

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,280
last thing I must show here to uh is

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,330
there we go some reporting I did put a

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,400
front end together for this and I'm

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,720
saving and that so I can dashboard it

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,730
check it out

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,350
I'm still working on doing additional

00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,420
reporting for it too but I have basic

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,610
stuff for it too there's a link to the

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,540
site too on the on that that bitly link

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,010
I gave you as well so great so I do have

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,120
a couple more to do items I do want to

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,840
do it I mentioned this is a work in

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,310
progress but something I want to do is

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,080
hook up stitch functions to do like

00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,550
weekly email reports so I don't want to

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,050
get like a text message or email every

00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,580
time it cackles bathroom I frankly don't

00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,140
care that much but be nice to get like

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,250
some like weekly data or some I

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,470
aggregate data or run some additional

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,270
analytics on it I'd also love to do some

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,440
more front-end stuff with it and like I

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,210
mentioned - I would love to juice like

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,100
some machine learning with it - I just

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,810
want like I said I just like data I'm

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,929
like I want to like I want to take it to

00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,200
the logical extreme see how far we're

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:09,790
gonna push it so

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:14,080
okay great so we went over a real-world

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:15,330
example I hope that you see that the

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,440
code actually isn't that complicated

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,760
we're connected to it we tell what pin

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,260
that go to and we have some callback

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,830
functions we can do some work with on it

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,600
it's action of that bad but we talked

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,730
briefly about the GPIO how are you

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,060
sending data out and in to the board

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,650
we're over a hello world making the LED

00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:38,620
blink using johnny-five and over a

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:40,450
Sperry PI we went over the code for how

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,150
I did that switch data and how I handle

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,350
the load cell data we went over the

00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,380
spawn child process to handle that

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,760
Python subcode we went over the IOT time

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,190
series data and how we sent that to the

00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,150
club and then we went over kind of my

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:55,930
next steps for what I want to do the

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,840
project as well okay great let's see

00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:01,660
here

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:06,550
alright last part here the future

00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:08,080
I love presentations that go over like

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,320
their predictions this stuff is all

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,530
speculative they're educated guesses but

00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,120
it's work I I don't know what's next

00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,390
what's next and what's weird we can

00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,340
start with two so four thinks I see

00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,169
first thing duh we're gonna continue

00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,390
seeing smaller and smaller devices that

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:27,130
are more powerful I'm using the

00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,679
Raspberry Pi 3 B plus the resume for

00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,600
just came out super-powerful overkill

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,390
for my project didn't need it but we're

00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,540
can continue to see smaller and smaller

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:39,070
chips being added on every day and I

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,260
think that trend is just continue happen

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,429
we've seen stuff like even chips you can

00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,540
show in your clothing

00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:48,310
we're seeing great stuff I love when

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,750
downside to JavaScript currently is its

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,540
footprint so it's garbage collection

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,830
it's huge and it takes a it's a minor

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,990
memory footprint when you're installing

00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,640
that out of device I think that we're

00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,050
gonna see JavaScript footprint getting

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,080
smaller and smaller and more optimized

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:05,500
versions for for Hardware too it works

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,290
fine but that be made one caveat if

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,540
space and memory is a major concern for

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:15,310
you you would maybe want to consider

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,480
using C or C++ you're handling all the

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,970
memory on your own there's like no

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,150
garbage let it's like you're responsible

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,289
for

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,190
all of it but it also makes it way more

00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:25,270
efficient to run on a piece of hardware

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,880
we're gonna see better hardware support

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,529
- I like him enter the load cells that

00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,250
wasn't so currently supported by a four

00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:34,660
by Johnny Five there's a issue in a PR

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,210
open for it right now to get it fixed

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,619
and get it natively supported but as the

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,670
platform's get more mature and they were

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:42,099
gonna continue to see better hardware

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,589
support for that as well and then this

00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,539
one is always the tricky one and

00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:48,220
honestly I think is the biggest issue

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:52,589
for IOT devices

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:56,200
Ted Bay and that's power and batteries I

00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:57,789
think we're we're already seeing power

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,010
is already the bottleneck for our

00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,710
devices today and I feel like everyone's

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,480
begging our cellphone companies to get

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,760
better battery life and they're doing it

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,010
mostly through software and like just

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,109
optimizations of the processes to make

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,630
better use of the battery life I feel

00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:15,670
like I'm hacker news and reddit I see

00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,760
you know graphite battery breakthrough

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,990
at MIT labs or whatever weekly and I

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,460
don't know I haven't seen any that

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,260
actually come to consumer market yet but

00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,690
uh I'm crossing my fingers that that's

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,059
gonna be issue regardless though the

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,720
problem to a shrinking devices becomes

00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:33,099
not just battery life but heat I think a

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,420
lot of times like we have those massive

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,220
computers that produce a ton of heat as

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,680
our devices get smaller and smaller -

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,910
and they were gonna produce they're

00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,500
gonna produce more and more heat - which

00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:43,690
also could be a concern as well some

00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,289
batteries massive problem we haven't

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,700
cracked that yet like my my litter box

00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,230
is fine I could hook this up to

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,210
batteries I have a hook up to the wall

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,039
it's not moving much but a lot of

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:58,420
wearables have that but our bottlenecked

00:36:54,039 --> 00:37:00,420
buy it - okay great let's do a quick

00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,650
recap and then we'll wrap it up here so

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,660
we started the talk today with just

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,640
doing a quick introduction to IOT I

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,660
teased anything we put a chip in it we

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,539
talked about my favorite types of

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,940
projects being stupid-ass projects and

00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:15,220
IOT market is growing with with an

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,079
asterisk there why you should be

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,569
considering no JavaScript with your next

00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,400
IOT project 58% of node developers

00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:23,170
already self-identify ot developers

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,779
always our self-identify as no

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,609
developers javascript is a great choice

00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:29,049
for new developers seeing C++ are

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,319
awesome they're more challenging to

00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,680
learn them easy to update over a network

00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,020
Nets already

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,480
in JavaScript there's a ton of great

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,910
existing libraries we went specifically

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,230
into johnny-five here today javascript

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:45,220
is already an event-driven language and

00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,930
then we talked a little bit about iot

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,960
dated best practices so when you're

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,670
looking for a UT database or database to

00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,680
save your IOT data some things you could

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,359
should consider are looking at a

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,619
database that's able to ingest data

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,880
quickly one that is event-driven just

00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,890
like we talked about javascript of the

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,650
callback functions you want one that has

00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,180
a flexible schema so that you can add

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:12,339
additional sensor data or change that

00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:13,599
time series data easily and look for

00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:15,819
databases they're able to handle time

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,260
series data well to traditional rpms is

00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:18,940
can do it well but like we saw with the

00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,170
document store it's a really easy native

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,750
way to do that and it works great for

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,059
reporting and analytics then we went

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,950
over a real-world example of my IOT

00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:28,540
kitty litter box and we first talked

00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,700
about the GPA on how to interact with

00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,369
the real world we talked about that IOT

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,750
hello world project making the LED blink

00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,579
we talked about that switch data and the

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,799
load cells you sent some data to the

00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,569
world or the cloud by and I showed you

00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:42,160
that time series data and we talked

00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,349
about net next ups the project and

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,569
lastly we talked about the future of IOT

00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:49,000
with smaller and more powerful devices

00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:50,140
and hardware you saw I predict that

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,369
JavaScript will continue getting a

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,280
smaller and smaller footprint as it gets

00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:57,130
more more efficient and will see better

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,710
hardware support for the existing

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,390
JavaScript and node libraries and lastly

00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,869
bottle batteries will be continued to

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,210
become the bottleneck I'll leave this up

00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:09,400
here too I see someone taking photos

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,089
okay so next steps - if I've inspired

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,220
you at all today

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:14,680
I hope the goal Dastak is to give you a

00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,079
just a gentle introduction to it I also

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,210
want to show you that it's ok to not be

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,059
