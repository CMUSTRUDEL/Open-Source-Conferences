The Node.js project is a vibrant and fast-moving place and it's sometimes hard to keep up with everything that's going on. Come listen to Technical Steering Committee members talk about how they keep up, their views on key strategic initiatives, what's up in the project and what they are most excited about going forward. We'll save time at the end for questions from the audience so think about what you might want to ask the TSC members and we hope to see you there so we can answer them.
