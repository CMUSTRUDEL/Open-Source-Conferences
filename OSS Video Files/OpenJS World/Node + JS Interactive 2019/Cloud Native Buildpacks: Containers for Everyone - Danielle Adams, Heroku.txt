	Cloud Native Buildpacks: Containers for Everyone - Danielle Adams, Heroku
Speakers: Danielle Adams
Buildpacks are the core of Heroku - they lower the operational burden of creating and maintaining application environments. Cloud Native Buildpacks combine Herokuâ€™s seamless developer experience with modern container standards, making it easy to build Docker images from Node.js source code. In this talk, Node developers can learn how to perform both OS and application-level upgrades, create Docker images without Dockerfiles, and run containerized Node.js apps with little configuration. (Docker experience not required.)
