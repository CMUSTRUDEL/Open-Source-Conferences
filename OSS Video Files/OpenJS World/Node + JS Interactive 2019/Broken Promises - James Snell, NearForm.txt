	Broken Promises - James Snell, NearForm
Speakers: James Snell
When a customer comes to us with a complaint that their code is running slowly, our first question has become, "Are you using Promises?". When they predictably tell us yes, our response has become, "You're likely using them wrong".

In this talk, we'll discuss the various ways Promises are abused. We'll talk about why that ends up needlessly slowing Node.js applications down. And we'll talk about how to use Promises correctly, the way they were intended to be used.

Expect code, opinions, and colorful charts.
