	JS in the Virtual & Augmented Reality Ecosystem - Andrés Cuervo, Independent
Speakers: Andrés Cuervo
Allowing people to overlay data on the real world & create user interfaces in 3D, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) — referred to together as "XR" — are rapidly emerging on our smartphones and on specialized headsets. Some believe that XR will change everything from entertainment & art to business software, so how does JavaScript play a role? Andrés Cuervo will look at how XR platforms today are adopting JavaScript through the Immersive Web API, developers are using Node to run JavaScript in embedded XR devices, and what the future of JS XR development might look like.
