Description: 
	JS in the Virtual & Augmented Reality Ecosystem - Andrés Cuervo, Independent
Speakers: Andrés Cuervo
Allowing people to overlay data on the real world & create user interfaces in 3D, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) — referred to together as "XR" — are rapidly emerging on our smartphones and on specialized headsets. Some believe that XR will change everything from entertainment & art to business software, so how does JavaScript play a role? Andrés Cuervo will look at how XR platforms today are adopting JavaScript through the Immersive Web API, developers are using Node to run JavaScript in embedded XR devices, and what the future of JS XR development might look like.

my name is Andres Cuervo and the

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,799
long-winded version of our title of my

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,179
talk is Jas and the virtual and

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,679
augmented reality ecosystem and the

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
reason I named it that is because I'm

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,060
gonna be talking about a lot of stuff

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,310
today but before I get into that before

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,699
I get into it I'm gonna talk a little

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,029
bit about Who I am I'm an artist and

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,029
engineer a software developer right now

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,940
I'm an AR engineer at an marketing

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,410
technology company called moveable Inc

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,969
and we're building a web AR platform I

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,800
am NOT gonna be talking about that

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,860
specifically today but you can come find

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,200
me afterward if you want to know more

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,649
and before I talk about sort of the

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,320
place that web XR has and VR and AR have

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,340
I want to talk a little bit about the

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,260
web platform as a whole so how many of

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,210
you have heard this phrase before the

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,820
web platform great okay so that's like

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:10,170
yeah so it this is a pretty amorphous

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,600
term the most reliable source on the

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,280
Internet wikipedia says that the web

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,310
platform is a collection of technologies

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,460
developed as open standards by the w3c

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:25,650
and other standards bodies like open J's

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,540
like ACMA and so on and that's one

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,450
that's sort of one way of looking at it

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,270
another way of looking at it is if you

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,790
go to platform that html5 org you see

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,180
this giant checklist and it's rather

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,340
overwhelming of all the various specs

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,979
that can cut that can possibly fit into

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,720
a browser and this is another way of

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,430
thinking about it but the thing that's

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,200
important to remember about this concept

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,020
of the web as a platform the web

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,189
platform is that we're all these check

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,860
boxes are meant to enable users or users

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,670
or developers to create new things or

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:06,000
have new experiences and so when we talk

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,179
about introducing webex our to the web

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
platform like the low level

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,080
implementation is this thing called the

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,900
WebEx our device API

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,850
but what we actually want to enable are

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,880
things like what's on the slide right

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,260
here and if this if this doesn't really

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,000
make sense to you I'll go through some

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:30,420
more examples for the rest of this talk

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,210
but in general the the breadth of X R is

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,310
meant to cover everything from our

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,650
mental reality to virtual reality to the

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,310
normal sort of 2d web that you that

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,980
we've been programming for decades now

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,810
so in at its most basic level something

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,890
you can already do today with the canvas

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:56,420
API or three Jas is embed a 3d scene

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,420
onto a page when we talk about Web Excel

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,170
if we're talking about an error context

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,850
then we mean something like grabbing the

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,610
camera and telling you where the floor

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,100
is or telling you where or telling you

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,560
being the developer telling you giving

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,500
you back a mesh of geometry and allowing

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,250
you to place here a green cube but

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,090
anything into the real world when we

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,640
talk about VR basically it's all of that

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,090
stuff - the camera and - the real world

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,670
and while these look like really

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,320
disparate use cases under the hood they

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,240
can sort of be unified and that's what

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,260
the well that's what the webex our API

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:42,180
is trying to do so the webex our API is

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,630
relatively recent and so they're a bunch

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,730
of theirs they're a bunch of tools to

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,370
get started with this work so I'm gonna

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:55,140
go over sort of what the state of the

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,970
art has been traditionally and the sort

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,400
of the most high fidelity experience at

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,140
least for prototyping with web AR for

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,330
the last couple of years has been using

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,050
custom browsers so because the webex our

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,150
device API hasn't shipped in in most

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,200
browsers and it wasn't even standardized

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,930
until February of this year the easiest

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,540
way to get started sort of hacking

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,169
around with those api's was actually to

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,669
use a few different custom browsers one

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:28,120
from Google called web AR on a

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,379
kit slash or webinar on AR core it

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,590
doesn't really roll off the tongue

00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:36,039
basically all it's doing is taking those

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,080
proprietary AR ap eyes so AR kit and

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,039
they are core on iOS and Android

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,939
respectively and fusing those to a an

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,509
instance of a web page so this isn't

00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,210
Safari

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:52,360
this isn't Chrome well this is Safari on

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,189
iOS but the point is like this isn't a

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,620
shipped browser like this like you would

00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:58,599
have you this link goes to a github page

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,150
and you would have to download that and

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:05,889
manually builds build an a custom app in

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,279
Xcode and then get that onto your phone

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,569
in order to get this running but it's

00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,699
really it's really interesting because

00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,490
you're able to actually use WebGL and

00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:18,279
JavaScript and it has access to things

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:22,779
like the plain or two things like hyper

00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:25,870
accurate device orientation the other

00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,449
option that's a little bit easier to get

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,580
started with is the WebEx our viewer

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,000
which is basically the same thing but

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,469
provided from Mozilla and they actually

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,289
put this on to the App Store because

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:41,770
they realized that getting like not

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:43,689
everyone either has a has an iPhone but

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,099
doesn't have a Mac or it's just not

00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:49,120
everyone is comfortable building a

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:52,259
custom iOS app randomly off of github

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,699
and so they provide a similar thing and

00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,430
those are two sort of like custom

00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,169
browsers for a long time VR was the same

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,990
way where you would have to fork you

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,659
would have to download a custom fork of

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,939
the web of Google Chrome or Firefox in

00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:11,050
order run web VR before that was

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:14,259
standardized but now we have a bunch

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,939
more options and so the rest of the the

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,770
rest of the tools in here are going to

00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,860
be things that can actually run in

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,180
regular browsers so the first and sort

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:27,250
of most common one in my mind is 3j s

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,310
for a long time 3j s was sort of the

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:36,099
default way to do any 3d onto a normal

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:38,520
2d inside of a normal 2d web page the

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:41,940
all these examples are actually

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,819
the WebGL context running on a VR device

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,039
so you would navigate you would be in

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,289
your VR headset you would navigate to

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,840
the three Jas examples website and you

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,630
could click a button and say enter VR

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,210
and that would that would automatically

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,930
move you into one of these experiences

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,110
and that's that's sort of where we're at

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,880
right now and you can do really basic

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,650
things but you can do a lot with these

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,060
really basic things like position and

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,699
hand orientation and stuff like that the

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,909
other option that is actually built off

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:22,860
of 3GS is this library called a frame

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:25,470
and whereas 3GS itself is a proper

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,780
JavaScript library a frame has a

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,319
completely different goal a frame is in

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,360
was designed explicitly for people who

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,120
only have familiarity with HTML and CSS

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,770
and don't and are and are possibly

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,520
intimidated or just don't want to deal

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,940
with WebGL or three or you know

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,430
disparate three 3d contexts so in order

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,590
to understand a frame a little bit this

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,599
slide shows you all of the code for the

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,199
scene that's gonna run in the next slide

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,690
so here you can see in this is a normal

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,960
body and then everything inside of here

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,530
is a frame code it all looks like HTML

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,469
in fact it if there's library precedes

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,389
the web component spec but it was

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,639
modeled off of web components so

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,460
everything has a dash in it and it's

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,380
everything starts with a dash a dash

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,930
scene is the top level and that sort of

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,580
gives you your 3d environment and then

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,560
anything you put inside of here that a

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,639
frame recognizes it will actually create

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,469
for you in a full 3d world and see what

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,389
that actually looks like so this is an

00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:32,940
iframe and right now I'm dragging around

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,579
with my cursor and I can actually press

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:40,620
either with my arrow keys or my WASD

00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:43,020
Keys I can move really naturally in here

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,850
if I was on a mobile device this button

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,850
at the bottom right would allow me to

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,860
enter Google cardboard view if I was

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,629
hooked up to a VR machine it would give

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,509
me the VR instance that we saw earlier

00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,939
and just to sort of prove out like that

00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:01,269
this is actually what's running you can

00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:04,269
even in real time at the scene from the

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,429
inspector they're like these are just

00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:10,600
normal HTML elements that are bound to

00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:12,249
the WebGL context and so that's a really

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,540
easy way to get started it handles

00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:21,040
almost all the complexity for you that

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,269
was in case it didn't work so the one

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,240
other popular library that's been around

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:30,730
for a very long time is a rjs so the

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,730
when I showed you where they are where

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,670
they are kit or web they are on a our

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:39,279
core and kit that was taking advantage

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,439
of what we call markerless AR basically

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,819
true AR right like you can point it at

00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:46,959
anything and it'll give you back a depth

00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:49,899
estimation this is marker based AR so

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,970
the the way that this works is you

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,879
basically have a computer vision system

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,889
that is looking for a specific marker in

00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,350
this case it's looking for the word hero

00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:05,529
inside of a big black Hollow square

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:07,720
right and then it uses three J s to sort

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,360
of superimpose that on top of the marker

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,339
and it can tell let them when the marker

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,369
is distorted and it will distort the

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,549
three J as seen above it and this is a

00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:20,290
really this is a really easy way to do

00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:24,790
sort of two prototype image image image

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:29,740
detection interactions and sort of like

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:33,759
more more product focused sort of vision

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:38,049
based AR experiences and this runs just

00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,240
in a normal browser one other tool is

00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:42,369
model viewer which is itself a proper

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,230
web component that Google provides and

00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:46,540
it's relatively new I think it came out

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,999
at the end of last year or at least it

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,569
was open sourced at the end of last year

00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:56,829
and again it is just HTML with a script

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:58,990
import tag and you can see on the on the

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:00,639
right here this is sort of what you see

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,860
if you're on the desktop view but if

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,870
you're on a phone that either is an

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,560
Android phone and provides this this API

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,980
called scene

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,920
or if you're on a iPhone and it provides

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,570
this thing called quick look model

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,029
viewer knows about it it knows how to

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,060
call out to it and so similar to a frame

00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:21,190
but for a very specific use case if you

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,720
pass it a 3d model it'll allow you to

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,520
preview it in a art which is what you

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,529
see over here on the very the very right

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:33,040
this is just like a direct screen grab

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:35,680
from my phone one other tool is this is

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,410
the second-to-last tool is tensorflow

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,850
j/s so the attentively there are a few

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,110
tensorflow J's people at this conference

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,490
and they gave a talk earlier today and

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,430
they're there's a lot of low level stuff

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,980
you can do with with machine learning on

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,320
the web but one thing that they provide

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,750
is this higher level sort of ready-made

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,540
model that they've trained on a bunch of

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,850
different samples of bodies and what

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,950
they actually provide back is not just a

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,440
skeleton but away you can see over here

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,480
on the right a way to map out like the

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,640
purple is the head the green the light

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,970
green is the torso you could

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:17,680
theoretically sort of build a whole mask

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,360
over over these people in WebGL you

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,860
could add 3d models onto them you could

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,589
do you can do a bunch of interesting

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,800
things that all begin to sound exactly

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,480
like they are sort of like what what

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,980
five years ago would have been like very

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,770
hard to do industrial AR and speaking of

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:40,330
Industrial a are there is this one other

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:42,280
toolset that is sort of web adjacent so

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,990
there's this iOS prototyping tool called

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,810
torch and torch is designed to very

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:53,080
quickly get you started with AR it's a

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,990
no code tool but it actually just

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,360
recently like last month introduced an

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,160
export option and they partnered with a

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,700
company called eighth wall eighth wall

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,880
is a web AR company so under the hood

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,260
they take all of their sort of iOS

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,630
prototyping code transfer it over to

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,310
eighth wall and then you can view it in

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,140
a normal browser this is run you can see

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,510
here this is running in a version of

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,510
iPad Safari

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,850
and so yeah that was a very long sort of

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:26,920
laundry list of tools and they're the

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,389
these slides are already up so if if

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,639
you're curious about any of them and

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,690
digging into them you can I've linked to

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,250
all the relevant resources the last

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,500
thing I want to talk about is sort of

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:45,040
the future of like what all of this work

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:47,920
is heading towards so there's just on

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,920
Tuesday a couple things happened this

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,260
company that is an AR headset the one of

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,980
the biggest air headset companies

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,829
magically they produced a series of web

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,750
tutorials and release them as sort of

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:04,470
both an open source blog post and as

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,839
projects on a platform called glitch

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,760
glitch is a really easy way to sort of

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,199
like share and remix code it's similar

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,870
to like code pen if you've ever used

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,959
that but it has a little bit more it

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,959
gives you a full nodejs environment

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:23,920
anyway seeing like big companies like

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:27,550
magic leap or microsoft with hololens

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,199
sort of release web-based tooling is

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,480
really interesting and it means that

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,019
there is sort of is industry support for

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,420
all of this something that is very

00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:42,130
nascent is this website called immersive

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:46,029
web dev which is actually run by this is

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:50,199
maintained by the w3c a few folks on the

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:53,220
w3c immersive web group and this sort of

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,449
gives you a nice starting place for

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,220
figuring out what are all the

00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:59,230
requirements how do you do

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,540
vrn AR on phones how do you do vrn err

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,220
on desktops etcetera etcetera etcetera

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:06,569
and it also at the very bottom of this

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,790
page provides you with examples with

00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:13,810
Babylon a-frame 3GS a bunch of the tools

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,130
that I mentioned today and the final

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,949
thing the final really exciting thing

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:22,180
that happened on Tuesday was that chrome

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:26,649
was the first first browser to ship the

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,689
WebEx our API not not behind a feature

00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:29,699
flag so you don't have to turn anything

00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:33,569
on as a

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:36,389
chrome 79 I'm pretty sure it just works

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,910
and there

00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,529
this means that because a lot of VR

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,989
browsers are actually built on top of

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,819
chromium this means that a lot of VR

00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,739
browsers when they when the next time

00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,679
that they update are going to get a lot

00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:52,259
of the features or again I'm gonna get

00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,239
these features for free and this sort of

00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,879
this is just the first step right like

00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:59,189
next we need every browser to implement

00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,129
it but everyone is on board the standard

00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:05,309
has been like actually drafted and so

00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:06,899
this work is like I'm not gonna say

00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:10,619
nearing completion it's it's a very big

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,689
milestone and then the last thing is I

00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:15,299
know I threw a lot of like random

00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:18,989
resources at your face and there's a lot

00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:22,290
of overhead here but there because there

00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:24,720
is so much work to be done and so much

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,069
work actively being done the last thing

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,259
I want to say about the future of XR is

00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:31,339
that it probably starts with all of you

00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:33,600
there it's a small space right now but

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,249
there that means that there is a lot of

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,789
there was there's a lot of low-hanging

00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:42,809
fruit for open-source contributors for

00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:46,439
people to do work getting JavaScript

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:49,339
ready for for this immersive future with

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:54,809
all the tools that I talked about yeah

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:57,470
and this QR code goes to the link for

00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:01,150
these slides yeah sorry these slides so

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:07,380
yeah that's all I have

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,380
