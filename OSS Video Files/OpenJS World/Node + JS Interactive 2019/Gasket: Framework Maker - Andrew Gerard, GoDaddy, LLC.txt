	Gasket: Framework Maker - Andrew Gerard, GoDaddy, LLC
Speakers: Andrew Gerard
There is no one-size-fits-all framework, but there is a way to assemble frameworks in a common fashion. All that's needed to seal the junction between multiple technologies is a gasket.

Gasket is the pluggable tooling that GoDaddy developed to create a standardized framework with robust plugin system for our own apps. Learn how we use Gasket to bridge together technologies such as Next.js, Express, and Redux along with our internal services. Get a first look at Gasket as we open source it for others to start composing and sharing their own pluggable frameworks.
