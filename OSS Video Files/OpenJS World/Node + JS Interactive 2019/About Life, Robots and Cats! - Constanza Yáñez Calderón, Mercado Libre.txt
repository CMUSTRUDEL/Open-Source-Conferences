	About Life, Robots and Cats! - Constanza Yáñez Calderón, Mercado Libre
Speakers: Constanza Yáñez Calderón
When I was a child I dreamt a lot about creating robots that helped me in my daily life, like tidying up my bedroom. That was just a dream till I grow up and found out that there's something called home automation. So I decided to build Sasha, my cats' pet sitter, that helps me by feeding my cats when I have to get home a little bit late. Sasha changed my life and my cats are stressless because they can eat their meal at the right time.

In this talk, I will share my experience on using JavaScript to build Sasha and will walkthrough its features. Last, I'll talk about other possible use cases and the potential of home automation with JavaScript.
