	About Life, Robots and Cats! - Constanza Yáñez Calderón, Mercado Libre
Speakers: Constanza Yáñez Calderón
When I was a child I dreamt a lot about creating robots that helped me in my daily life, like tidying up my bedroom. That was just a dream till I grow up and found out that there's something called home automation. So I decided to build Sasha, my cats' pet sitter, that helps me by feeding my cats when I have to get home a little bit late. Sasha changed my life and my cats are stressless because they can eat their meal at the right time.

In this talk, I will share my experience on using JavaScript to build Sasha and will walkthrough its features. Last, I'll talk about other possible use cases and the potential of home automation with JavaScript.

Bonjour hello I'm so glad to be here

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:15,350
with you to see a lot of friends from

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,660
from South America so hi my name is

00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:22,260
Constanza I'm from Buenos Aires

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,760
Argentina I have some sweets from my

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,740
country if you if you want one of them

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,650
I'm a front-end developer at Merkel

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,710
Lutheran there is an e-commerce company

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,500
from South America and I'm a team member

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,510
of Chicopee Raimondo a community of

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,120
women the range to make the tech

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,140
industry in Argentina more diverse by

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,520
our Nicean workshops and meetups

00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:53,550
participating in different ways are with

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:59,940
other communities but I'm here to talk

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:02,290
about life robots and

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,470
[Music]

00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:10,130
cut three of the most popular things on

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,670
the internet right in this presentation

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:18,790
we are going to see this topic a life

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:22,540
story a pet feathers design building

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:27,710
programming process of the pet feeder

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:31,730
but let me start with a life story when

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,970
I was four years old my family made me

00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:37,420
clean up my bedroom put the toys away in

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,090
boxes do the dishes

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,430
sometimes through the patio by then I

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,229
was so angry because all I wanted to do

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:51,320
was to play with my friends and toys so

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,619
I used to have this dream that was about

00:01:51,320 --> 00:02:00,020
creating robots that could help me in

00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:04,640
with these chores I had and then I grew

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:10,039
up and I still have chores and even more

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,170
than before but now I have to cut away I

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,650
had one cut because one of them passed

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:22,700
away a few months ago but this project

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:25,510
is for him also also and Haku sometimes

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,230
they had to wait for me to be fed

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:34,280
needless to say I rarely get home early

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,980
so if I give them the day serving in the

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,080
morning they eat it by noon and when I

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,640
got home at 9:00

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:47,450
they're hungry and as for multitude

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,670
so I need to think of a way to to give

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,710
them the day serving the food in a

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:58,490
smaller servings even if I'm not around

00:02:53,710 --> 00:03:01,490
since I wish I could build a robot 25

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,840
years have passed and I see what one

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:08,569
that helped me in my daily life

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,820
so I know that then nowadays there are a

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:17,030
lot of options that fill our needs but

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,720
some are expensive and I can't offer

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:25,700
them and that's why I decided to build a

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,820
pet feeder that I call Sasha then I

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,910
started googling so a similar project

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,960
and I could hide me in the development

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,720
because 830

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,970
I started to program two years two years

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:44,210
ago and I thought that this I thought

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,600
that was that would be pretty difficult

00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:51,290
for me so I saw a lot of example and

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,670
most of them were built on Python and

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:59,840
the structure were just for one cut

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:02,900
however what I was what I'd need was

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,690
something that could feel both cut at

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,290
the same time because I don't have much

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:13,580
space in my home because it's cheaper

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,660
don't have two machines so these are the

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:20,810
things I used to build Sasha a

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:26,210
microcontroller or a computer a serie

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:29,919
dispenser and a servo motor the third

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:34,220
dispenser is similar to that one but

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:40,729
it's the the one I used is we are done

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:44,180
don't that I use a microcontroller so I

00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:47,919
had to decide which microcontroller or

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:53,110
if I will use a computer

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:56,960
there was an Arduino or Raspberry Pi or

00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,080
something similar for some reason I

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,039
thought a Raspberry Pi will be the best

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,300
option do it - how easy to work with is

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,990
it's a Burton system actually I use the

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,740
Raspberry Pi because someone let me want

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,919
the model 3 and I learned to configure

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,099
it from scratch I installed installed

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:25,040
raspbian and a parenting operating

00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:29,610
system for Raspberry Pi

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,280
for the servomotor and you need to use

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,010
one term to move the dispenser blades

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:40,010
and there are many models of servo

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,010
motors you can get the one that turns al

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:49,820
45 degrees or 180 degrees or there are

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,820
some that has a continual rotation I

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,760
decided to use JavaScript to develop

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,090
their feeder because I'm learning to

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,340
program with this language and I wanted

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:08,880
to call something different of what I do

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:11,850
every day which is front-end and I made

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,030
a research and I found a platform called

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:19,080
johnny-five and that allows you to work

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:22,460
in robotic system with JavaScript but

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,610
before that I had to install raspy IO

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,970
there is a plug-in that enables you to

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:33,390
work with johnny-five on the Raspberry

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,670
Pi to code the configuration is pretty

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,540
easy you just have to install it and

00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:42,230
require the model in your JS file then

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,560
you have to call both Molina function

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:48,780
that's it

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:53,520
and to run the project I use no J's so

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:58,140
let's go to the big process as I never

00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,530
build something like that before my

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:06,870
knowledge on the subway and a sublet

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:10,890
subject sorry was no I never connected

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:13,140
wires before but there are some things

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:17,160
there one thing I learned from movies

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,460
that is that there are conventions for

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,830
connecting cables and if you if you

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,370
don't follow them you can make a mess of

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,210
things so all I wanted to do was not to

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,210
burn my house

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:36,060
after and they set up the first thing

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:40,140
the first thing I tried was who was who

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:48,360
was turning on like a tiny light and to

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:52,590
my surprise it work and so I dive into

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:57,300
the world of servo motors and try to

00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:00,660
make one work but that part wasn't that

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,840
easy as I was suspecting I needed to

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:08,100
connect the servo the servo motor to the

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,720
Raspberry Pi by jumper wires I use free

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,450
of lamb because servo motor has three

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,220
and the sign now the red Wonder is

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:20,100
positive and the black one is the

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:24,030
negative and the Raspberry Pi has a lot

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:28,590
of pins where to put the wires but you

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,669
cannot use just any I kinetic requires

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:36,570
two different pins and the servo motor

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:40,620
didn't work until I found out that there

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,840
are some some some things that need to

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,979
be connected to a specific pin of the

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,070
Raspberry Pi

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:54,030
for example controlling the direction of

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:58,470
the of the servo motor blades and to do

00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:03,930
that you need to connect to a pulse

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:09,060
width modulation pin I use the GPIO 18

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:12,000
and the Raspberry Pi has just four pwm

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,660
pin so I connected to one of them and

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,210
the other one must be connected to a 5

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:25,200
volt pin on a ground pin during the

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:28,890
process I learned that not all servo

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,720
motors are the same as I say before some

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,340
of them turned 45 degrees others 180

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,180
degrees and there are some with

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,800
continuous rotation I used all of them

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,800
till I found them all I need

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:55,100
you have to set which pin are you going

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,100
to use which type of servo motor I

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:04,440
didn't know I didn't know that you must

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:08,400
consider the weight of what you want to

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:12,540
move so I had to try several motors for

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:17,250
different weights my house was full of

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:22,980
service all over the table and I choose

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:25,200
the one that can resist 3.2 kilos and so

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,690
it's certain testing the feeder and I

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:36,350
could make hit stop with the amount of

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:39,740
food I wanted and that's what happened

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,640
the food of their food a lot of times

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,750
all over the table

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,210
and that drove my cuts very crazy and

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:52,230
there is a fun fact that when they heard

00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,960
the sound of the food getting out of the

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,280
feeder they came to me running and

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:06,360
started mooing lot of time that part was

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:11,250
very funny so it turns out that to to

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,890
move the servo motor with continuous the

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:17,940
with continuous rotation you need to

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:21,900
move the place clockwise and so it is

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,540
necessary to set the to set the top

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,780
speed of the server blades and when you

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:35,480
want to stop there is server dot CW

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,480
between the parentheses is the the speed

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:44,610
so I set the feeder to give them food

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:49,920
twice a day and I use this NPM package

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:54,780
that is called nhadra you'd just have to

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:59,190
to just set the minute the the hours

00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm got it I left the the the program

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:06,140
running and thanks to that I realized

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,940
that the theater wasn't working properly

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,780
because it was letting out the food

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,500
every hour my cuts were were really

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:20,810
happy about that

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,810
but that was no was I was expecting

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:28,020
after spending a lot of times trying to

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,350
figure out what was the problem I

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,730
realized that the package that I was

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:38,460
used I was using before not chrome

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:42,710
wasn't working properly so I replaced

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,710
the package for other that works better

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:53,540
the filler was almost done but one day

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:58,530
my cards got up really really early like

00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:02,640
5:30 a.m. and they're starting mooing

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:07,040
loudly I was so sleepy and HR I and

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:11,610
tired to get up and fill their bowls um

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:17,580
but I knew that if I didn't do that

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:20,790
they will keep crying and that was the

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:25,410
the point where I thought I shall

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:29,339
include a new feature and that feature

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,800
is send an email to the feeder from the

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,900
comfort of my the bed and then go back

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,460
to sleep

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:41,910
so I looked for another package yes by

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,180
that time I was like this cut sticking

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,690
it's known in every library I found he

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,750
like out the right one for the project

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,940
to develop this new feature i used i

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,650
found these packages this package that

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,310
allows you to set up the email

00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:05,880
configuration it's called main notifier

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:08,300
and I can't explain how I felt the first

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,820
time I mailed

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:18,140
and it work I think that I might have

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:21,260
shed a couple of Tears literally my next

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:25,460
step is to develop a telegram boat so I

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:28,130
can replace the day mail and Johnson

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,130
sent in a telegram message and the best

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:37,220
thing about about God is that I'm going

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:41,600
to learn how to build a boat so this was

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:45,520
the feeder before becoming the robot and

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:51,050
that is with with the Raspberry Pi

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:56,180
that's awesome after a lot of time

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:59,290
developing on Justine Sasha I can say

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:05,460
that the dream I had when I was a child

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:09,679
came true so I built a robot

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,679
[Applause]

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:21,100
I have a lot of time I have a lot of fun

00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:23,860
building Sasha because there is nothing

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:30,329
better than developing something you

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,329
with your poor bodies by your side

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,410
building Sasha and getting all these

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,990
achievements made me realize that I

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,360
wanted to do more projects involving

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,499
robotics and that there are a lot of

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,709
potential use cases of home automation

00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:54,279
that I would love to implement like

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:57,579
control non-smart things like the lights

00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:02,529
or air conditioners or the temperature

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:06,309
of the room etc and I know that these

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:09,249
things are already exist but I would

00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:13,389
love to build them from scratch because

00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:16,929
I learned a lot during the process and

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:21,279
that encouraged myself to keep growing

00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:23,709
as a developer but what makes this

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,629
project almost perfect is that you can

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,799
build this figure only with little

00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:32,139
JavaScript not acknowledged and one

00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:37,059
thing I realized that is a perfect

00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:40,749
activity to teach to program even even

00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:42,879
if there are parts that include not

00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:46,929
coding like building the structure glue

00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:51,299
in pieces and etc because you can teach

00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:57,490
variables conditionals using packages

00:16:51,299 --> 00:17:01,749
set it up a computer and I don't know

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:05,770
much JavaScript and as I say before I'm

00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:11,919
Ali I'm learning and I've shown to other

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:15,339
people to my English teacher how the the

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,880
feeder works and they started saying

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,549
that they want to do things like that

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,530
for themselves and they think that is

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:26,860
incredible how

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:31,780
with a little bit of hardware something

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:35,110
that you may find in your home and a

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,710
little bit of code you can make

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:42,130
something new work this project only has

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:46,840
a 42 lines of code

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:49,120
it's really small and I'm sure that

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,900
there are amazing projects to rebuild

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,680
and to be shown and maybe those projects

00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:01,000
can inspire other people to do things to

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,850
facilitate chores or change how they

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,050
interact with their homes or with just a

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:14,330
little bit of code so I have I have the

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:19,579
resources if you want to check that's it

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,579
