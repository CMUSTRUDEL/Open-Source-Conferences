	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,180
the answer is tabs all the time it's

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,230
starting right off with it yeah all

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,030
right all right so I thought we'd start

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,809
with an easy question is JavaScript

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,750
gonna be boring in 2020 do you think

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,550
this is boring this is awesome right

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,230
well I know this is a question that I

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,980
was thinking about it I think Java

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,349
Script in ogs has become boring in a way

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,050
that's actually all right you know that

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,170
it's so well-established that it's

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,579
becoming something that you just expect

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,800
I was talking about this earlier in the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,750
week and I'll try out my analogy I'm not

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,219
sure if it'll work but you know we all

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,719
turn on the water in our you know our

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,370
bathrooms or our kitchens all the time

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,430
right we don't even think about it but

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,160
just think in those days when those

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,570
pipes were brand new like in hundred

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,180
years ago whenever it was and you're

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,680
like oh my gosh look at that boo those

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,230
marvels but over time it just became

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,719
boring and we just expected now there

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,090
will be the occasional issues with rust

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,890
or pollution or whatever it might be but

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,400
hey that's that's that's the life of

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,290
code to write me boring is a sign of

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
success right you know you look at Linux

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,100
it's used everywhere that's and it's

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,229
kind of boring no road no one really

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,060
goes to a Linux conference anymore but

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:26,610
it's used everywhere so it's just a

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:28,530
sinuses go so Linux conference I go well

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,600
I don't think is boring at all like

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,090
there's a lot of advanced and conference

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,860
and a new libraries and packages all the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,329
time happening so I don't think

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,400
JavaScript is boring man I don't think

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,890
it's going to get boring anytime soon I

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,829
mean yes it becomes affable but no

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,159
boring like a stable is not a synonym of

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,840
boring the waters not boring water is

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,299
you can do all kinds of things with

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,509
water just like you can do all kinds of

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,939
things to JavaScript so the underlying

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,469
the underlying JavaScript and OGS is

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,960
there and that's a good thing it should

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,460
be boring as someone from outside the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,310
JavaScript community is more of an

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,079
infrastructure person I sometimes get

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,369
entertained at least by what goes on in

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,289
the JavaScript community when the whole

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,910
left-left pad thing happened I'm like

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:15,280
all right JavaScript cool

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,170
I'll open for you so from an external

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,240
perspective it's a it's a little bit

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,910
interesting and exciting but ya know

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,530
from a stability maturity point of view

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,970
it's just a widely used technology of

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,650
course it's gonna be a little bit more

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,960
boring than some new programming

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,850
language out there yeah and we kind of

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,680
started like from the bottom with

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,500
JavaScript right it was developed in ten

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,500
days and not developed for the world

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,880
that we live in now really but it has

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,590
evolved over time and it's getting much

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,990
better and it's getting I mean it has

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,420
gotten so much better but the language

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,910
itself just provides so much more and I

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,350
think that that might be where you know

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,210
some of the drama came in with like left

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,670
pad you know we have we have pad start

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,550
now and pad end like there's the the

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,220
language itself provides you with so

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,350
much that you don't really have to rely

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,030
on third-party tools to do that sure and

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,860
so maybe that is an indicator that it's

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,400
it's starting to get boring but there is

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,610
drama from the start there was all kinds

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,830
of drama you know I mean there was like

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,800
you know you had Netscape you had Sun

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,480
yeah Microsoft you have Brendan going on

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,110
vacation and coming back and the world

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,750
changed I mean it was it was a totally

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,300
different time and but one of the things

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,720
I find interesting is like in

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,540
conversations with people especially

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,430
here over the past few days is there's

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,010
still an existential crisis though going

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,650
on right there's this there's this fear

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,420
that oh my gosh you know we have

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,000
something so good we can't ruin it I

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,350
thought miles of discussion on that and

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,200
isn't in his keynote the other day

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,290
really really hit upon it that there are

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:55,000
lots of lots of lots of still present

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,959
fears that are very real yeah and kind

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,370
of tying in to that do you think that

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,510
like frameworks do you think the

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,170
framework wars are coming to a close

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:07,720
like are they starting to get more more

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:12,040
stable at least in terms of what we're

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,950
using day to day it's a good question I

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,540
mean you know the JavaScript tends to be

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,310
a community where people like to write

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,959
little packages and you know there's

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,680
lots of solutions out there there's

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,940
definitely a bit of you know like

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
monoculture maybe all right the worry

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,310
where like there's

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,980
framework set reactor angular are

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,390
probably some of the most widely you

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,400
know you suppose these ones even jQuery

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,770
is still you know running the internet

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,790
you know and unfortunately or

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,560
fortunately you know uh things tend to

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,370
coalesce in a solution you know over

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,720
time we've seen this in other

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,730
programming languages where some stuff

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,170
just eventually gets baked into the

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,820
language itself over time or there

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,570
becomes just a standard library I don't

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,680
think that's necessarily a bad thing but

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,050
you know that there is definitely some

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,740
gravitation towards you know a standard

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,720
set of tools for folks I don't think the

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,350
frameworks are in award their know like

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,120
let's go to battle airing now I mean for

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,940
me is more like a healthy competitions

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,200
of frameworks and tools like there is

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,060
different fragrance because they're

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,170
different needs so it's not like a

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,630
warlike so yeah I don't think there's a

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,760
word there yeah yeah definitely I mean

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,040
it definitely seems like a lot of the

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,110
popular frameworks are kind of

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,820
coalescing around the same set of ideas

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,880
things like virtual DOM and JSX usage or

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,160
things like that there's a lot of

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,590
coalescing into that do you see that as

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,500
being a good thing or is that kind of

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,060
stifling innovation you always want to

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,840
enable competition but at least from

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,970
like you know from an end-user

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,250
perspective you know I'm a you know C

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,310
C++ JVM person and sometimes I write

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,290
basic JavaScript apps and I'm like what

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,760
the hell do I need like need to use now

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,500
it's like what the hell is view j/s

00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,910
right like where this come from right so

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,190
it does make it I think a little bit

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,419
confusing from you know a newcomer and

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,340
user perspective when you have all these

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,410
options but the competition is good to

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,750
kind of ensure innovation will

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,750
constantly happen so the trade-off

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,890
you mentioned yeah yeah so they are kind

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,600
of coalescing around around those ideas

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,270
and do you think that that is helping us

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,140
to kind of hone that sword and make that

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,940
the best the best possible way forward

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,260
well when I talk to developers here they

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,310
say they say there's just different

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,960
needs right and so you know reiax has

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,100
have been you know popular i think

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,130
in some respects with large

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,720
organizations you know and and in in

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,090
people who are in smaller shops may have

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,880
more freedom in really different needs

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,979
and demands and so that seems to me like

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,509
again to what you're saying is like

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,850
there are different requirements and

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,860
there's different issues I mean what do

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,400
you what do you see people using these

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,160
days well behind no it's actually I was

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,289
watching the Stack Overflow survey and

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,330
know it is one of the most widely used

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:11,930
but yeah it's not a fragment of runtime

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,780
but the field is very used and after

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,000
that react and then angular and view

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,919
there's also I mean in front-end like

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,320
react angular and view are definitely

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,070
needed top three frameworks into battle

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:30,229
but it's more like a competition and I

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,760
am so bad that's what I think you know

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,770
as long as stuff gets like eventually

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,750
baked into the language over time or

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,030
something thrown in tc39 you know a lot

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,949
of the stuff that jQuery you know

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,229
originally pioneered kind of made itself

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,639
you know baked in the language over time

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,110
as long as that competition happens I

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,270
think it's it's good it's great for the

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,979
community yeah yeah definitely and I

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,490
think that yeah as you mentioned there's

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,199
like 60% of developers are using react

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:58,099
do you think that that number continues

00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,020
to rise in 2020 well I think we had grew

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,669
as much as we could like I don't think

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,650
there's going to be a massive grow like

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,330
double the users I don't think that's

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,479
possible but I think it's going to grow

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,690
like a little bit more and if a new

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,870
framework comes we got a kind of

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,340
ecosystem definitely but yeah I don't

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,570
think it's going to grow like massively

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,520
I think it's going to more like yeah I'm

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,930
sure there will always be a scion for

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,190
those of us who reject the matrix yeah

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,430
kind of speaking of that and you kind of

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,650
mentioned the idea of like a monoculture

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,800
possibly forming another widely you

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,479
wildly use tool is a typescript and so

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,150
that also has kind of 60 percent of

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,979
developers using that according to the

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,810
Stack Overflow and it's also the third

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,880
the seventh most popular language but

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,600
the third most interesting language for

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,070
developers do you see those numbers

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,770
changing at all in 2020 or die's

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,740
the more developers seeing the light of

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,630
a statically typed language I'm

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,430
definitely on Team static statically

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,530
typed but that's just my preference I

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,130
don't know I I was born in a different

00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,020
time but I know uh you know you know

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,270
languages like JavaScript and Ruby were

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,060
popular for many reasons but I would

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:16,310
love to your opinion no I type screen

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,040
growing a lot like I think is that is

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,690
not a lot in this year yeah much easier

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,950
to build tools when you have statically

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,660
typed line which is my opinion just it

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,610
hasn't been that much movement do you

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,380
think in the in the community over the

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,870
past year and changes in typescript

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,420
overall versus other languages yeah it

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,950
doesn't seem like that that trend is

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,780
gonna change at all it doesn't seem like

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,760
there's anything in the wind unless I'm

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,190
missing something

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,450
yeah I'm not sure there's there's lots

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:54,760
of things that could change that I'm

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:57,320
sure but yeah there's I'm not sure yeah

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,930
but do you see that kind of leading

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,290
towards a rise of like a monoculture of

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:08,900
tooling that we okay so for example in

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,670
monoculture tooling I see the developers

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,480
used like always the same - for example

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,400
vias code most of them I mean most of

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,910
JavaScript developers to use PS code for

00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,130
other languages they have other tool

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,830
needs but for Scala and Python and they

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,450
use other text editors for JavaScript

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,160
see Bella pers I see most of them using

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,160
big s code and I think it's good like

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,840
via scope is a great tool and if it

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,480
works and as long as it's free and

00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,660
open-source I think it's good I don't

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,090
care Microsoft always man it's number

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,580
one on in the October stuff yeah he's

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,960
number one yeah I mean as someone who's

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,600
been involved for open-source over 20

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,250
years it's a little bit a little bit

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,500
terrifying of kind of what's going on in

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,490
some ways cuz I spent probably 10 years

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,780
of my career you know battling you know

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,600
the evil empire at the time which was

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,340
Microsoft working on you heard of

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,170
eclipse you sniff anybody use eclipse

00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,130
again sorry I was partially my fault

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,890
back in the day

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,690
but you know you know eventually what

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,760
what happened was what did you do to

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,350
eclipse Chris I read yeah you know I

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,550
mean if you're a Java developer back and

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,870
then you probably use it but I write

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,790
used to write all the plug-in tooling

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,770
all the git and SEM tooling bells those

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,780
are a dozen other age but the reason it

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,360
clips was formed is because there was a

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,010
bit of a monoculture of tooling at that

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,450
time one company owned the majority of

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,550
tools and the developer documentation

00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,360
all that stuff and people are

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,910
uncomfortable there's no way to

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,100
customize it it was an open source and

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,720
so this huge community came around

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,220
Eclipse and you know Chris for someone

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,940
who who lived through those battles

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,510
seeing that you know you have vs code

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,370
you know github a typescript you know

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,600
all owned again by by one company is a

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,670
little bit terrifying you know I think

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,770
Microsoft's been a great steward but I

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,840
think it's something you know us as

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,450
developers need to keep these like you

00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,950
know organizations in check essentially

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,410
make sure that what they're doing is

00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,030
actually good overall for for everyone

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,490
but something that keeps me up at night

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,320
at least but you know I've worked with

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,180
folks that are like oh yeah Microsoft's

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,640
great like you know they're amazing I'm

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,590
like I guess now but like there's some

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,930
of us have a different context I mean

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,260
today culture of Microsoft has changed a

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,750
lot like he has a very better reputation

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,490
a few years back they're awesome

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,870
like they've contribute a lot I'm super

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,190
stoked but there's always something that

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,900
you know as the back of my shoulder that

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,070
you know let's not let's not make this

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:34,560
happen again so Google so Google is

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,570
Google comparison I think Google's great

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,550
they contribute back I've mentored tons

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,840
of folks in summer a code that's it's a

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,850
different different history Google has

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,980
always kind of been fairly open over

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,150
time but you know it's something that

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,590
they think about because at the end of

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,990
the day like I have it having

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,650
competition with different types of

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,490
developer tools is good it helps improve

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,700
things and so on so if we we lose that

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,500
you

00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,090
we just have to be careful I think we

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,620
need to ensure that there's enough

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,780
competition out there you know there's

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,460
always you know your old Vimy max kind

00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,370
of die hard you know they have been team

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,870
them but you know we just need to ensure

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,970
we need to have a healthy competitive

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,860
ecosystem out there that's fair at fair

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,510
and neutral in my opinion absolutely but

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,790
with the popularity of something like BS

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,460
code and and I just learned today well

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,830
yesterday at this conference though

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,240
about how you know they can package up a

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,350
full dev environment you can just

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,480
connect with your browser and have

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,830
everything Linux running right there

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,100
yes code remote or whatever they yeah

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,260
yeah yeah yeah super swingy how do you

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,980
how do others compete with that kind of

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,050
infrastructure

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,090
well it's interesting is like back in

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,500
the back in like the Eclipse days the

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,970
whole idea is we want to make tooling

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,700
free and available you won't have to pay

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,690
for you know code warrior-like back and

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,600
it was terrible you have to pay for

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,070
tools back then terrible life and so

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
everything was open not what's

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,490
interesting is like with the trend of

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,740
kind of having this you know vs code

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,050
online or other stuff online now it's

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,050
like hmm you know is this potential

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,700
opportunity to like charge for certain

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,130
things now it's like oh you want to have

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,670
like some fancy you know linking you

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,350
know that will be $5 per you know liyan

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,490
lines or something ridiculous I don't

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,870
know it just you know as an old

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,180
developer tooling person it a little bit

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,640
tear it terrifies me that sometimes this

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,920
stuff will become only SAS based and

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,080
locked again but yeah if but if the if

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,780
the core code like vs code is fully open

00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,240
then then maybe we're what we're okay so

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,890
yeah and Microsoft's on the good team

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,780
now so so so we're good

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,610
I am NOT like super concern about

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,410
monoculture because I'm being I think

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,680
the other person wants to use something

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,230
that gives them value mmm-hmm and vias

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,940
code gives a lot of value so it's like I

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,740
don't I don't really see your problem

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,930
there is like a monoculture there of

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,200
course competition is healthy and if

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,180
something better comes in great but if

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,020
not like it's fine like the monoculture

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,250
is okay as long as it's useful right as

00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,250
long as it's useful as long as it works

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:04,050
yeah it's open yet well what does that

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,320
do the other ones out there who are

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,180
vying for a place then I mean you know

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,140
how are you I'm curious on how you're

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,690
seeing that competition

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,670
emerg it can that competition to merge

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,900
it all that you if you just accept that

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,030
monoculture I mean it just depends let's

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,410
just put it that way so we'll see if you

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,420
know like github starts getting these

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,360
like interesting like open and BS code

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,720
online type features but but we'll we'll

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,220
see

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,960
and I think developers in general like

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,190
tools are kind of religion they love you

00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,890
know things and everyone will have their

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,510
particular you know nuances I know folks

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,130
that you still can't rip like Emacs you

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,690
know out of them even though there's

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,370
much better options these days but

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:47,640
that's just the way certain folks

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:50,970
certain folks are so kind of talking

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,490
about that and leading into that as as

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:57,300
those types of things like server lists

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,910
and cloud infrastructure start becoming

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,880
more mainstream becoming more what we do

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,580
every day how do you see the roles of

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,500
developers changing seems like with with

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,840
the ability to no longer have like this

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,330
monolith codebase that you know is in a

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,270
particular framework or language you can

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,880
use the right tool for the right job but

00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,450
what kind of changes does that cause for

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,650
the the developer maybe like as far down

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,650
as the front-end developer do they have

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,510
to to worry about this as they go

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,300
anything that lowers the barrier for

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,580
people to contribute and develop

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,480
something of use to them I think is is

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,640
great i I just don't want to be in a

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,080
position where you know you know I I

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,020
grew up an environment where you could

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,760
tinker with computers and you know learn

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,990
you know how everything works when you

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,580
kind of get this environment we're like

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,650
on a server list thing is like you know

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,390
I just need to go write couple functions

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,070
tie some events and it just like

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,680
magically Auto scales I don't have to

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,510
like understand how any of that actually

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,280
works I mean that's a great thing but

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,840
you know part of learning is to actually

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,020
tinker and be able to kind of understand

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,060
behind the scenes of you know of how

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,920
things work but well you certainly have

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,320
to tinker with kubernetes yeah that's

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,060
that's my that's my project these days

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,550
but but but I mean I get you know the

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,860
analogy people use is like you know you

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,390
know tons of people drive cars every day

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,920
no one really knows you know how you

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,630
know the car works you know under the

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,400
hood so my got fair enough maybe that's

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,400
that will

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,350
and for you know the future of apps you

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,690
know for the next decade we'll move to

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,310
more of a service model and if that

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,070
brings a whole new generation of

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,450
developers awesome I think I think it's

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,210
great we need more software developers

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,190
out there so I have a question for the

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,440
for the crowd how many how many here

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,120
interested in kubernetes it's a

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,900
different audience for me I'm gonna use

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,290
kubernetes oh it's great Wow

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,720
hands which mean interested in you Wow

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,820
well I mean I haven't I have another

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,830
question then is this for a career

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,350
interest or just is this for a career

00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,280
interest or for work do your apps

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:08,090
running kubernetes well wow that's like

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,040
I don't know 20 percent maybe 15 cuz I

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,270
was getting feedback from the from some

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,950
people who I was talking to were just

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,490
saying well you know I the company's

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,670
starting to use kubernetes so I think I

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,260
need to start like looking into it and

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,000
you know and they kind of like seems a

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,350
little bit hesitant about it but the

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,630
crowd here their reactions a little bit

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,160
different and I mean well one thing that

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,110
would really I think is really would be

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,300
exciting to see is more people who are

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,280
in the JavaScript in the community be in

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,920
the kubernetes community because there's

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,190
that then that all issue around

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,860
developer happiness is it's it's it is

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,450
present you know at the end of the day

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,370
it's like you know how many people in

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,770
the nude and JavaScript communities know

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,010
like how the kernel fully works right

00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,720
probably not not many I mean I don't

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,040
think you need to know the full you know

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,570
internals kubernetes is a little bit

00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,740
different in a way where you know at the

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,150
end of day if you're writing a

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,740
distributed application in your services

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,630
you have to understand a little bit but

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,730
I don't think you need to understand the

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,710
full you know under the hood how how

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,150
everything fully works but well maybe

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,520
not how fully works but at least be

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,440
involved to help you know I'm sure that

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,030
improve that improving developing and

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,790
improving developer experience is always

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,530
always a fun topic so you know it's a

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,600
tool that was originally built by

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,890
infrastructure you know engineers I mean

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,100
the kernel is not necessarily user

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:33,250
friendly no you know

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:35,350
anyway so yeah yeah but bringing in

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,690
those different like more diverse

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,580
thoughts absolutely help I'm curious on

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,550
what is the know to JavaScript community

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,180
need to make it more diverse and happy

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:48,670
is there any viewpoint on that Amina do

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,440
you see anything in particular from you

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,740
know when you talk to people about or

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,960
when you look at across the community

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,430
what would be what would bring what

00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,740
would make the community richer in terms

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,910
of its participation or do you think

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,640
it's pretty far ahead of other

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,620
communities what you seen well I mean

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,500
you can just see right here it's not

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,600
like a very diverse community like I

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:16,500
just want to see that how many women are

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:20,560
here or identify as a women you see like

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,900
so I think a lot of work has to be done

00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,260
into the more diversity and more

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,570
community because it's proved this has

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,360
like scientific studies that shows that

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,490
when more diverse if the team is more

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,610
diverse they have better results in

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,230
every sense so I think diversity is very

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,660
very important and also for example I

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,490
saw video like a couple of months ago

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,230
there really impact with me it was just

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,390
like a simple mmm soap dispenser so you

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,470
put the hands and it give you soap soap

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:55,720
right and so it only working for white

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,820
people if of that person put the hand

00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,430
like the soap couldn't read that it was

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,040
a person there's I wouldn't give them

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,890
soap so that's why I like diversity it's

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,960
so important like for me like the people

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,940
that are creating soft words are

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,800
creating technology i creating the

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,080
future and we need a future that is more

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,380
diverse for everybody so we have like a

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,320
better word right so so yeah i think we

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,180
definitely need more diverse communities

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,590
and more than theirs events and bully

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,480
the people creating the tools are

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,680
creating the tools for them yeah exactly

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,870
and so we need a more diverse outlook a

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,190
more diverse mindset that goes into that

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,600
to make sure that it accounts for

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,390
everyone and not just the people

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,110
developing it definitely that's a cross

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,720
I think all that

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,270
a ton of a ton of factors Gio's gender

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,040
you know etc one thing that kind of was

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,559
interesting for me reading the the

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,770
stackoverflow server survey report where

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,600
I think it was the majority of people

00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,929
according to their report but it were

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,940
had less than I think three years or

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,530
three to five years it's like as it as a

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,840
developer so just also making sure

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,030
you're you know inclusive for for people

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,670
that are new to the craft you know a lot

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,140
of people are learning on their own and

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,340
all this stuff and so trying to make

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,020
sure the communities are inclusive to

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,400
the folks that are just starting their

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,750
journey absolutely

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,940
what are some actionable actionable

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,350
things that we can do in 2020 to make

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,410
that easier for new developers and more

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,020
diverse developers to get in well I know

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,630
it's partly our responsibility in you

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,179
know in the media to be a part of that I

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,870
really believe it I I think that part of

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,760
our role is not to use to like talk to

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,640
people from various backgrounds and

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,460
really get their get their perspectives

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,590
on application development or or

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,750
application management right or how you

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,429
building architectures and just trying

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,919
to reach as many people as we possibly

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:53,080
can who are representative of the

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,520
largest society because underrepresented

00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:00,580
minorities are are sorely looked over

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,490
from our point of view yeah for me I

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,590
think there's a lot of things to be done

00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,710
for example you can mentor somebody else

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,559
from represented you can also donate

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:13,240
money also one of the things that I'm

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,299
from Columbia and one of the things that

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,510
has worked a lot is just leaders

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,160
creating meetups or conferences and also

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,640
like giving all these opportunities to

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,500
people that cannot like access to them

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,960
so so yeah there's a lot of things to be

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,309
done I guess I actually was seeing the

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,900
github survey and it was really

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,059
impressive that the open source

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,950
community is growing our love in Nigeria

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,350
wow that's very interesting and also

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,179
like in South America so I think there

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,559
is a lot of talent out there is just

00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,980
they don't have like the environment and

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,620
the research to give back and to create

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,470
awesome things so it seems like at least

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,240
you know we cover the the cloud Native

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,480
community pretty closely and

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,650
and there's a very small it's a very

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,940
small community of underrepresented

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:06,760
minorities but there's a very core

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,700
strong group of people who are very very

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,490
close and very you know supportive of

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,770
each other and it's that mentorship and

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,870
that you know and that those peers that

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,940
seem to be so important for those

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:22,150
communities there for the communities to

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,010
really you know build upon that yeah I

00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,470
think it just it has to be part of your

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,700
values and you know for us to help run

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,320
developer relations at the Linux

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,570
Foundation and something we do for all

00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,790
of our events is you know have you know

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,700
diversity you know scholarships on every

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,290
single you know event we do lunches

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,660
networks and anything to kind of help

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,309
connect people you know I hope more

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,770
conferences you know could continue to

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:46,360
do that type of work also meeting people

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,059
where they are so you know doing events

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,620
that may be a new Gio's and stuff like

00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:55,030
that so people could travel you know

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:57,220
sometimes you know we held a cube con

00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,050
recently a couple weeks to three weeks

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,580
ago and we were running to people that

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,190
could had like visa issues coming into

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,110
the u.s. because you know God forbid we

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,550
can't run a country anymore but you know

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,710
it's it's it's just a tough situation

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,090
other substantial crisis yeah it's just

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,710
entra crisis so like you know like doing

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,090
events in you know the regions where

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,490
it's easier for people and generally to

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,920
get to or or closer to to to where they

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,670
are yeah definitely and I definitely

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,710
think it's it's good to have like you

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,690
want to see yourself in your role models

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,670
and so having that diverse set of role

00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,730
models is really important I was also

00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,370
reading a book recently about how like

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,100
one way to or a big way to address this

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,530
is through having having role models

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,850
when you're young about and and you know

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,790
really encouraging that when you're

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,370
young and seeing people who look like

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,929
you and having them as role models and I

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,390
think one really great way that we saw

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:54,480
at this conference was Elly Galloway

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:59,260
Elly Galloway yeah who is fantastic

00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:02,890
she really she really I think lit up the

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:04,900
stage in just a way that she also lit up

00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,570
her software which is fascinating to

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,990
just that that whole kind of New Age of

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,430
jewel BOTS and IOT and it gives me a

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,610
little bit more faith in humanity

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,580
at least cuz at that age just doing

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,470
stupid stuff yeah

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,530
and for that but I was thinking about

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,450
her and she comes from a good

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,760
environment and has supporting parents

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,960
and all of this but what happened with

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,510
the kids that don't have yeah so that's

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,820
why the community comes in like people

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:40,630
for example I have in the community I'm

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,910
from we volunteer to high schools we go

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,220
there like a lot of community leaders

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:48,040
actually come from high schools and

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,560
people were teaching each other so so

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,020
yeah I think Ellie is a great example

00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,060
it's awesome I I hope to see more kids

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,220
and more girls involved I think it's

00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,440
also the people in this room right you

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,200
know every every person who's sitting in

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,590
this room right now after 5 p.m. on a

00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,080
Thursday lunch dog Canada probably many

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,840
far far from home are very passionate

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,280
about their work I mean and they can

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,440
just didn't and that that's just always

00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,730
gonna be shared and I think it's just

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,400
the more opportunities to share that

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,140
passion and share that dedication I

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,110
think actually can be very self

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,930
fulfilling too so what are some things

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,320
that we can do in our work in our open

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,120
source work in our local communities to

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,950
that are actionable though that can push

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:39,940
this message forward in 2020 it's so

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,760
many things I mean you know I'm sure all

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:46,420
of us know that in our communities with

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,760
local meetups you know supporting the

00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,730
groups that are really supporting under

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,600
represented minorities girls who code is

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,280
a very strong chapter in Portland

00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:03,310
there's I think there's also ways to

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:04,960
reach into to the schools you know for

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:07,420
instance I mean I come from a you know

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,160
background in journalism so there's

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,990
plenty of opportunities for for me to go

00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,520
out there and you know and talk to

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,560
people about the work that I do I think

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,920
that's so just so very true for

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,590
developers yeah I think companies must

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,350
be involved as well like they they have

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,780
the resources to make more diverse

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,540
communities and - yeah because one of

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,580
the biggest struggles especially for

00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:34,570
their work countries and is money right

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,930
so companies should be able to give more

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:39,970
and yeah I think companies you know so

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,580
like people in general just like

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,240
volunteering and mentoring just giving

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,340
worships the meetups is the big thing

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,860
yeah there's lots of ways to yeah donate

00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,370
including time resources like money and

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,780
food and things like that yeah I spend I

00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,210
run our local kubernetes meetup

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,670
mentoring I've helped people sometimes

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,920
land you know internships that they may

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,050
not have you know the connection because

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,570
you know that you know I think you know

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:09,040
there's tons of developers out there but

00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,690
like opportunity is not something that's

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,280
necessarily you know equally spread you

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,570
know to everyone so just making that

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,220
connection you know for someone

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,240
definitely definitely helps absolutely

00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,820
so there's one other subject that I

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,230
wanted to transition into before our

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,790
time is up and that is security what do

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,800
you think I think there will be some

00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,190
kind of huge hack or vulnerability

00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,750
disclosed in 2020 terrifies me like

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,200
every day I don't know how many people

00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,180
follow

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,280
there's an account called Internet of

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,020
 on Twitter yes one of the best ones

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,880
right and so it's just like every day

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,980
it's just like why do we need like

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,020
something that like makes cookies you

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,540
know it needs to have like an IP so if

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,260
they're like SMS me when the cookies are

00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,580
done or like it recently it was like a

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,330
toilet needs a firmware update and

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:00,520
you're like you know so so what's crazy

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,320
is that you're having you know software

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,380
is pervasive it's all around us now in

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,730
you know toothbrushes fridges TVs the

00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,890
thing that terrifies me is you know

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,830
let's say non-traditional tech companies

00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,820
may not be the best tech savvy folks so

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,550
they may not like

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,950
update their dependencies as much even

00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:23,830
developers in that crowd like you know

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,750
how many people here like when they

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,820
publish to NPM like how many do you

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,830
people like sign your packages and also

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,360
have to FA enabled on your account I

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:35,800
don't think it's everyone in this in

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,260
this room there's one oh yeah we got one

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,440
is there another one in the house so it

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,180
just just over there so just just in

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,770
general having like good security

00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,360
practices that are not only followed by

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,650
open-source developers or companies so

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,350
so this is something that definitely

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,330
keeps me awake at night because software

00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,720
is just gonna end up in more and more

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,710
things from like cars and you know I now

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,390
have like one of those fancy little

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,030
electric thermostats at home like what

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,530
happens if you know someone hacks it and

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,330
messes with the temperature and drives

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,600
me crazy so it's like it does I think

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,550
security is is a global thing that we

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,470
have to all work together on improve and

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,660
and it's and it cuts across communities

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,340
it's not only you know that the no door

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,230
open jazz community you know we have an

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,030
increment Eddie's land we we recently

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,050
sponsored a bunch of security audits for

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,490
our communities I would love that

00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,710
something that opens yes could do to

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,600
kind of fund these things but it's it's

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,240
it's something terrifying but the

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,170
opportunity I think as a bunch of

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,020
communities come together and prove

00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:35,260
things is awesome yeah I was just

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,570
actually I was just looking at from the

00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,820
snick presentation today did anyone go

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:42,130
to the sneak presentation today was it

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,470
revealing to you yeah the super

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,060
revealing and like the new root

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,480
vulnerabilities each you've got each

00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:52,900
year by ecosystem it's you know NPM is

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,150
just gone whoop and you know but it's

00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,100
true too for a cross open-source I mean

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,810
you you see this across the community

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,460
yeah it's a software supply chain issue

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,590
yeah it's it's such a multi-faceted

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,240
problem because there's just no one

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,400
solution right like it could be bad

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,590
dependencies it could be maintain errs

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,910
that disappear like all this stuff

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,410
happens it's really like a cultural

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,090
change that you have to do to kind of

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,550
get things and it's something we should

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,740
all work together across are you seeing

00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,110
I mean are you seeing developers I mean

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,670
in your colleagues that you talk to are

00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:26,670
they carry more about security

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,670
yeah okay all right all right

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,190
especially like the people that works on

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,980
security like they're super paranoid

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,820
whatever the parents I've seen that yeah

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,240
yeah

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,220
so paranoia you know that can work right

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,750
yeah I mean I'm not where I don't work

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,280
in security so I'm like super max I'm

00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:47,450
like oh sorry

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,770
absolutely I was like maybe we should

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,510
have like we usually have like meetups

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,430
to like learn about like new languages

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,620
maybe it's like let's just do like a

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,930
meet-up to like hey everyone turn on to

00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,330
FA please or something well yes teach

00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,130
people the benefits but I don't know

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,630
something needs to be done it definitely

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,670
keeps keeps me up well this is the

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,640
existential crisis so I think this is

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,500
the 2020 existential crisis and actually

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,530
this is the biggest threat I think to

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,510
the node in JavaScript community and I

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,490
think you know it's security they are

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,560
none and it's not just node it's not

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,890
just JavaScript but we're here and

00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,320
nodejs coughing so I'm like you know

00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,720
that but that's yeah a cube con I'm at

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,980
an automotive manufacturer to that it's

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
like oh yeah we're gonna put like

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,800
kubernetes in the car like why would you

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,180
do that like people will do that to like

00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,060
you know I'm sure it's in chick-fil-a

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,860
I'm noticing all like help no it's

00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,160
probably in some car it's probably like

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:55,390
an Tesla to face yet space that's that's

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:58,370
also terrified version well yeah that

00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:01,340
that is a big thing I think to watch out

00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:03,050
for in 2020 is security the first CVE in

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,450
space someone's gonna get that and

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,220
that's gonna be quite awesome oh I think

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,560
there was one I think they did have a

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,940
CVD incident okay okay oh no no no no

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:16,070
there was a okay no space I think there

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,620
was actually a gonna person charged with

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,139
a private space but you know see the

00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:24,409
easier to come well I want to thank you

00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,760
all we have run out of time they say to

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,700
usually end these things on a high note

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,230
but instead we're ending it on air

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,540
we're all doomed thank you so much thank

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,780
you

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,780
