	Stream into the Future - Matteo Collina, NearForm
Speakers: Matteo Collina
There was a time when Node.js streams were all the rage but over time the Node.js Core Streams codebase became extremely complex and hard to understand. Worse still, WHATWG introduced an API for browser Streams. The two Streams APIâ€™s are incompatible with each other and both are complex and leaky abstractions. In this talk, a Node.js Core Streams maintainer presents a stream-less future by demonstrating how to use pure JavaScript: Async Iterators and Generators can give us everything Streams can while being completely cross-platform and highly performant.
