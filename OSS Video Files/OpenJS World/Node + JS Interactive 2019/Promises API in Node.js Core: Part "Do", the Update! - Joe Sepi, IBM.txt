	Promises API in Node.js Core: Part "Do", the Update! - Joe Sepi, IBM
Speakers: Joe Sepi
Currently (Jun 1, 2019) there are only a handful of 'promisified' Node.js core APIs. But the great news is that there has been momentum building in tackling this effort and by the time of Node+JS Interactive, I expect that we will have made a lot of progress. I'd like to share with you all an update on: Where we are? What else needs to be done? And if more is needed, how can you help?
