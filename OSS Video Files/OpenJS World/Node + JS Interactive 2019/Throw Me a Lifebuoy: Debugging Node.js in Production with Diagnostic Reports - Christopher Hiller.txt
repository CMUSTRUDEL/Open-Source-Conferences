Diagnostic Reports are a recent addition to Node.js core. This feature enables insight into Node.js processes running in production—without needing to attach a debugger—and the results can be interpreted offline. If you've ever had to debug issues in production with a customer, you know this can be a life-saver.

I’ll show you how to trigger report generation manually and automatically, then use the results to diagnose a problem process. While this is fine and dandy, manual diagnosis can be tedious, so I'll also demo a toolkit I've been working on. This toolkit can help automatically detect known issues, redact secrets from a report, and much more.
