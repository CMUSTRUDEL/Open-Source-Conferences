	Work Less and Do More: Google Sheets for JavaScript Developers - Franziska Hinkelmann & Leah Cole, Google
Speakers: Leah Cole, Franziska Hinkelmann
Say goodbye to the days of TPS reports, and come learn how to automate the tedious tasks in your work day. Thanks to the extensibility of Google Sheets (and a special JavaScript client library for Sheets), as well as Cloud Functions, thatâ€™s easy. You can have all kinds of data, for example GitHub, Jira, uptime health, and even sales data combined and imported into a Sheet, analyzed, and output as an email report or slide deck-without ever opening the Sheet.
