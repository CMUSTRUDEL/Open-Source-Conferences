okay I'm Dave I'm from near form a I'm

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,870
Adrienne I work for motors and with

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,120
super excited to share what we've been

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,030
working on for quite some time with the

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,900
open Jas foundation it's the note

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,199
certifications with an S spoiler alert

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,590
yeah we have been working together for a

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,840
year on this project here we have the

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,539
URL for the certification you want more

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,130
information about this stop you can take

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,760
a picture if you want you can visit this

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,770
link later so let's start from the

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,620
beginning it really takes a community

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,079
this was born as a community for this

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,500
was born at this very same conference we

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,469
are right now that was announcing in

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,870
2016 were Tracy hands did the initial

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,340
kick star of this project here we are

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,190
seeing some faces of the community

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,739
involved in this project so I'm sorry if

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,719
I'm missing someone there I promise I

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,780
will put the picture back if you reached

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,540
me later so yeah thanks to the community

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,360
for helping with this not only was it a

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,220
cross community effort it's also became

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,210
across organizational effort and these

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:19,200
are the organizations involved near form

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,409
the company I'm working with in a

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,960
technical and authoring capacity node

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,110
source provided prop provides

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,540
operational support and reviewing open

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,140
Jas is the leadership coordination in

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,189
the certifying body psi for proctoring

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,670
which we're going to get into a little

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:44,640
bit more later and true ability are the

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:48,960
remote exam platform so why a

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,990
certification and why now well in my

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,310
opinion the the industry has has got to

00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:01,799
a sort of a maturation point where it's

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:04,530
grown over the years to being becoming

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,069
much more involved in a larger scale

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,520
projects and in the attack industry in

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,010
general we have demand versus

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:18,120
availability issue the demand is high

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,870
and the availability can be difficult so

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,180
what we need is a kind of an

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,829
optimization where we can standardize a

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,260
verification of skill level and that's

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:34,890
what we're doing with these

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,599
certifications and it's also about

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:41,099
opportunity creation where we can open

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:45,689
doors to allow people to come via other

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,519
routes than the typical because as I

00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:51,239
said there is a demand versus

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,579
availability issue so the the

00:02:51,239 --> 00:03:00,260
certification was kicked off as Adrian

00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:02,670
said in 2016 in Austin and we had a

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,980
group of people from across the industry

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,500
we had no source and near from there

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,180
there was also a belief Walmart Netflix

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,920
Go Daddy tinnies nodding I forgive me

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,950
for but on anyone

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,310
tinnie was there yeah he was actually

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:24,449
word you know there was the avatar yeah

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,919
so in in Austin we we decided upon these

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,000
principles that the Civic ation should

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,609
be outcome focused that it should be

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,459
framework and library agnostic that it

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,379
should support real world practices that

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,099
it was problem-solving over puzzle

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,980
solving so we wanted to try to distill

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,379
it down to actually solving problems

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,970
that you would face in everyday life

00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:52,889
rather than just technical conundrums

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:56,579
and we also wanted to not care about how

00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,470
it was implemented just that it was that

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,519
it sold whatever problem was being

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,739
presented in terms of Quality Assurance

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,540
certification all of the questions have

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,440
been peer reviewed by industry leaders

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,900
include an Adrian but also if you may

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,450
know Mateus Booz Charlie Robbins or Luca

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,650
Morosky these are all

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,370
you know very technical people that are

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,800
reviewed it was also alpha tested in a

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,520
sort of freeform feedback way it was be

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,090
tested with around 150 testers and when

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,710
we started off in Austin in 2016 we also

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,410
had a psychometrician guiding as

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,720
regarding the topics and the domains and

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,790
how to break things up and before we

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,650
went live it also went for a final

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,230
psychometric review with a few more

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:51,080
tweaks in terms of the certification

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,490
having long term integrity as in making

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,250
it so that it's not easy to commoditize

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,840
from a from a cheating aspect there is

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,210
variance you don't necessarily get the

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,990
same exact questions every time you take

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,340
it it's proctored by humans we're also

00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,380
going to have release cycles we're going

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,210
to keep it up to date which we'll talk

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,360
about more later and we also have the

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,790
ability to sample any captured sessions

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,680
and review them so now we are going to

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,500
discuss a little bit a word is actually

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,570
to take a certification test so here are

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,120
the exam expectations for you you will

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,470
be taking the test using a remote decima

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,600
environment this will work in a

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,840
processor tap so you will use a browser

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,180
to actually solve the test it will be

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,020
remotely Proctor ed so you will have a

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,970
real human you know checking the webcam

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,669
and checking the desktop everything you

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,250
are doing for the test so you can use

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,930
any tool that you want any echos you

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,300
know any library that you prefer to

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,860
solve the problems as they already

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,270
explained we are checking for their

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,430
results we are not checking for the

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,040
process you will do to accomplish you

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,400
know the solution and you can use any

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,190
online resource so you can use the no

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,990
documentation wherever you want but not

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,030
the Stack Overflow or related sides

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,790
because we are we don't want you to be

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,550
copying and pasting you know code in the

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,580
machine so yeah you are you you will get

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,340
resources to you know to remember how to

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,610
solve anything but you can't copy and

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,320
paste the code so this beautiful machine

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,680
it will be a desktop leanness

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,900
it will be mati so you have to be a

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,740
little bit familiar with this you will

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,410
have Visual Studio code beam too so you

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,200
know as a color editors you will have

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:47,250
postman so you can check the solution

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,530
for your restful api is questions you

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,050
have you will have main terminal and

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,720
Visual Studio code terminal and you will

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,930
have chrome as the default browser so

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,180
here's a screenshot about machine this

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,240
is how it actually looks at the

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,820
beginning of the test you will receive

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,130
instructions in this initial screen you

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,440
will have a timer at the corner as you

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,840
can see you will have two hours to solve

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,760
the test every test and yeah you

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,240
basically will read all the instructions

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,640
in this tab and you will use code or

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,180
beam wherever you prefer to actually

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,120
solve this so let's discuss a little bit

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,590
about the exam so preview so they

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,200
already say that we have two

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,290
certifications we have not GES

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,560
applications developer and we have not J

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:40,550
a service developer so let's discuss so

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,750
the node application developer exam is

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:48,360
about assessing your effectiveness

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,280
creating any type of node.js application

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,410
so the way that we did that is we took

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,630
an intersection of use cases and skills

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,140
that would be required and we test those

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,550
rather than testing you know X

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,310
application Y application so

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,540
theoretically by taking this exam you

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,870
should be verified at a basic

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:13,290
fundamental level for overall competency

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:15,570
with serve creating servers creating you

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,800
know desktop applications all the things

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,170
that Mars was actually talking about

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,300
before this is this is what we're

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,660
testing for this is basic fundamental

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,090
nodejs knowledge in terms of being able

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,490
to use no GS you you can use the core

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,110
API or you can use libraries it doesn't

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,630
matter whether you use ecosystem or core

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,870
the point is can you wield it

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,490
effectively to create any type of

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,560
application the only thing that's

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,990
missing from the node application

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:50,340
developer exam is the domains around

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:52,560
servers because so later let me let me

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,990
come back for that is I should have gone

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,270
over this more yeah fundamental concepts

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,410
it covers common use cases key

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,660
transferable skills everything I just

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,910
said and it smart on out comes an API

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,500
knowledge its load library and framework

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,589
agnostic in the node application

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,420
developer exam there's lots of small

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,589
questions there are about five to ten

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,790
minutes each that's different to the

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:16,800
other one and there's 13 topic domains

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,910
here's the his secret sauce

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,680
those are the things you need to know

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,430
and those are the waiting's for them and

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,589
here's a horrific colorful monstrosity

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,920
for you to enjoy with those in a pie

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:31,620
chart as well as I was saying the only

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,830
thing that isn't there is the service

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,980
stuff because so we have no J's

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,770
service developer certification this is

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,280
a total different certification

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,500
let's move this will test let's move to

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,320
the next one yeah so this will test

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,520
practical effectiveness using node.js

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,930
for real common problems creating

00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:00,150
servers and Kreator and restful api s'

00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:03,810
so OOP so you will be creating basically

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,490
servers press PLAY pis and testing your

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,970
security practices around these

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,130
applications so you will find this this

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,920
is way different you will have like a

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,810
small set of questions but every

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,180
question will definitely take some time

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,850
so every question will take you between

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,210
15 to 30 minutes so you definitely need

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:27,839
to code like a regular node.js web

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,460
application restful api and you can use

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,010
whatever you want we already said that

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,960
you can use Express you can use AC peak

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,640
or you can you specify that you know

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,070
just join the foundation that's nice so

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,270
it's basically two broad domains we have

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,760
servers and services which is 70% of the

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,640
test and security practices around this

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,040
kind of application that is 2% of the

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,079
test so to pass

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,440
of this certification you will need to

00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:01,680
score at least 68% I know it looks a

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,209
little bit low but you know it's tricky

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,009
it's actually really complex you really

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,139
need preparation for this you really

00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:11,819
need to study be prepared but don't

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:14,880
worry if you fail to score 68% we have a

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,740
free retake so if you you know misses

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,540
the first time then you the second one

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,579
you can actually you know be familiar

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,990
with the test and take another chance to

00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:28,290
pass so now we come to the issue of

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,870
pricing what's it going to cost you when

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,790
the certification was first launched in

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,550
October so some some people might be

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,190
aware that there was some pushback on

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,790
the price at that time which is very

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:45,470
fair the the problem with setting a

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,269
price a global price is that

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,740
socioeconomic status even in the same

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:55,980
country and around the world they differ

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,769
so we wanted to do this as I said

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,670
earlier as a door opening exercise not

00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:07,459
as a gatekeeping exercise so the exam

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:10,110
price as it stands is $300 per example

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:15,540
certification per per certification yeah

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:19,920
so in terms of addressing that potential

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:22,170
imbalance for some people that $300 is

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,829
totally affordable for companies that

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:29,459
want to have employees certified so

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:34,199
that's staying for that purpose but it's

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:36,689
not affordable for everyone so when we

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,000
initially launched certification Robin

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,819
wrote a blog post which you can find

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,329
here there was a response to some of the

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:47,209
concerns around pricing and how we might

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,130
be able to address that moving forward

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:51,480
so one of the key ways that the the

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,290
foundation wants to address this moving

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,670
forward is with scholarships

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,899
specifically scholarships partnering

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:04,110
with other organizations that represent

00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:06,170
specific groups of people that the

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:10,639
organization that the foundation can

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:15,139
grant sets of scholarships too in order

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,700
to do that we really need the four

00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:21,500
people to start talking to each other so

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:25,820
if you do represent an organization or a

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,980
group in in Canada in the US or anywhere

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,889
around the world please come talk to me

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,630
come to us Adrian come talk to Robin you

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,540
from that blog post you can find Robins

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,730
email you can email her because we'd

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,250
really like to start moving with this

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,079
and making sure that we can make this

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,680
available available to as many people as

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,720
possible the other way we have another

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,029
way to actually solve this problem is

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,860
named you know immediate term right now

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,550
we have some promotions and do believe

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,639
you know working to create more right

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,120
now the test every test if you want to

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,880
take one exam it will cost you just 180

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,100
so and it will be right until tomorrow

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,529
but here is here's the good part so you

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,949
can pay now but you can schedule your

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,600
test in the future so right now you can

00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,670
actually pay for the certification at

00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,529
this price and said that you're going to

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,390
take the tests in two months

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,459
so that will give you two months to

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,980
actually prepare and take the test so

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,589
let's take advantage of this if you want

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,040
both certifications right now is to 10

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:33,500
so it's preferable yeah but exams for

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,269
that and as I already said you can you

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,860
know say I'm going to take this one in

00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,089
two months I'm going to take this one in

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,029
three months

00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:45,920
forever and you will be able to actually

00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:48,290
take it so yeah what is the future of

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,089
this certification so we are going to

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,490
keep working on the pricing issue I mean

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,790
this has been the main concern of the

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,920
community for me I have to fill in you

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,569
know because I'm from South America I

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,130
represent I represent a lot of

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:04,220
communities there that can actually

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:07,370
afford this price so we are going to

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:11,149
work through you know this issue provide

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,819
accessible price for everybody also

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,260
moving forward we're going to be making

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,540
sure that the certification stays

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,209
evergreen we're going to synchronize it

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,939
with the node

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:24,579
long-term support schedule so currently

00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:26,319
the certification is against node ten in

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:29,740
April no ten is going into maintenance

00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:32,050
and no 12 becomes the is already the LTS

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,119
but will become the remaining LTS so in

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,879
April will do another release for the

00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:39,519
node twelve LTS and then October roughly

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,709
node fourteen will be released and we'll

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,709
we'll have the exam updated for that so

00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,629
as Mars were saying about the year six

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,160
modules and so forth if that lands in

00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,809
node fourteen the certification will be

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,610
adapted for that so that it stays

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:54,279
relevant that it stays current will also

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,679
be tracking industry best practices and

00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,809
conventions and assessing on a continual

00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:04,079
basis the certification for those needs

00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:09,069
also in the future more certifications

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,980
question mark so yeah we any ideas of

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:13,689
how you would want to see that again

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,259
we're on Twitter come talk to us talk to

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:19,059
Robin we're really interested in here or

00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,569
you have to say if you have more ideas

00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:24,040
we are open to any comment these as

00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:27,699
already said at the beginning of the

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,319
talk it takes a community so if you want

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:31,720
to be part of this please come with

00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:35,439
ideas please come to help us talk to us

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,029
so then yeah we are having if you're

00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,549
interested in being certified we are

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,559
having a workshop they have the

00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:44,170

we have no source of set up an

00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:54,129
environment that's essentially very

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,170
similar to the exam environment so you

00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,410
can have a play with it and and see how

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,939
