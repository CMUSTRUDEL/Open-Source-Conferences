00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,920
first maybe in person it was backstage

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
in montreal at node.js interactive

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,760
i think that was the first time that you

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
all had met in person

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
as well although you had been working

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,000
for a long time just quick

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
quick tell us where you're based and how

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,239
you all started working together

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
when the test was when it all started

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,760
oh you're amused my friend yeah so

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,200
um i'm i'm based in amsterdam

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,440
um but i think when we started i was

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
actually based in northern ireland

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,959
um we we kicked off

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,120
everything in austin um

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
and as you say finally got to meet each

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,920
other in

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,159
in montreal um so

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,959
yeah it was it's been it's been a long

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,239
journey

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,000
um but uh

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
we've we've been working together on

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,760
this uh

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,640
uh quite seriously uh in the last

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,680
uh year or so uh since we especially

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,959
since we launched

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,400
uh end of last year um

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,440
and uh yeah it was it was a i'll let

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
adrian take it from

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
over from where he is but uh one of the

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
highlights of being able to meet up

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,319
was the uh the coffee that adrian gave

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,720
me

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,720
coffee i need some more of it please

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,760
adrian

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,280
well okay that's nice nice to hear

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,360
so i'm from colombia and that's why i

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
always bring some coffee for my friends

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,200
why the coffee was so good

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,519
so yeah um well i

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,720
have been involved with the with the

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,760
certification

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,280
uh since the uh

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,440
we you know started uh helping

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,560
with the creation of the content uh

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
basically this was

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,800
after the process that community did uh

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
so we started you know putting some

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,560
order

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
into the a little bit chaos that was

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
created at that time

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
uh we have to change the profile you

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
know there are so many things that we

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
did

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
and pretty cool to actually finally meet

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
dave

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
uh wait i guess we were working for a

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,800
year before right

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
so a year before actually i met and

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
present

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,919
the the certification montreal so that

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
was a cool experience

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,680
uh yeah i was really a real president to

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
meet

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
you both there and even i think was the

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
perfect

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
platform to launch both certification

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,479
exams

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,560
great um and so

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,720
once you all decided to put together the

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
certification plan that idea was sort of

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
born in

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,479
the austin event um

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,759
what state steps did you take to pull

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,759
that content together

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,039
yeah so it was kind of an organic

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,720
process to begin with

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,720
um we went through different phases so

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,960
uh initially uh we had um

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
quite quite a few community contributors

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,560
involved in the early stages

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,680
uh and we had a good uh cross-section of

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,360
of the industry uh even represented in

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,479
the um in the setting the theme setting

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
the topics

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
domains and and even breaking it down

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
into tasks so there were people

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
from uh godaddy there netflix walmart

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
there were independent people

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,479
um there was that node source was there

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
near form was represented

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,919
by myself um so uh

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,120
yeah we had um

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,400
we had we had i think

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,639
you know that uh i don't know what you

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,280
call it that that concept where

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
you've got a lot of beans in the jar and

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
then

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,199
if you have enough people from enough

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
backgrounds

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
uh guessing how many beans are in there

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,400
the average turns out to be like

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
very accurate i i feel like from that

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,759
that from those initial inputs

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,600
uh in in those initial meetings we had

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,680
um we we we got somewhere pretty decent

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
in terms of what what the level should

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,039
be and how

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
uh and and actually even how to approach

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
it

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,680
even from a philosophical basis and then

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,039
from there we had

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,039
um the actual authoring stages where uh

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,960
after we after we defined the domains

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,960
and we we'd broken it up into tasks

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,280
those tasks were then uh implemented uh

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,720
via github via pull requests and issues

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,000
and different things like that

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,160
um by uh um

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,400
sort of by by community members to to a

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,520
certain extent um

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,000
and then uh what

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
then because it was a community

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,960
initiative and because of

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,000
uh different changes uh um

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,160
even in the organizations around it um

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,199
we move towards uh a different model in

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
order to

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
uh bring everything together and that's

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,599
when we sort of hit

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,960
hit the accelerate uh pedal

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,759
um put put our foot on the gas

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,039
um and and and sort of uh brought

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,960
brought all of those ideas and that

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
content together and curated it and and

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
pushed it forward

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,800
um then uh then

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,759
during that time uh adrian came in

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,440
and uh and really helped uh with the the

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,800
operational side of it

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,879
um making sure uh that we had

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,000
um uh sort of uh uh

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,759
sort of uh confidence uh

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,520
with with what we were working with

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
because um

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,560
in terms of developing the certification

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,199
uh it's not just about the content

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
it's it's about the uh the actual

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,280
software we wrote

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,800
software uh that actually validates the

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
candidate's answers

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
um and and provides a marking scheme and

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,320
different things like that so

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
um it's a lot more going on than than

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
just like what kind of question

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
would validate uh more than multiple

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
choices yeah more than

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,279
much much more than multiple choice yeah

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
for sure um

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
but we we can talk about more about the

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,040
questions as we go

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,080
great yeah i mean that part was

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,959
um quite tricky i mean uh

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,279
when we started uh checking the content

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,200
it definitely wasn't about the content

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
it was basically about putting something

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,920
together that made you know

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,959
sense uh because there were so many

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,640
different items

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,560
well we have the domain is really clear

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,839
but we have to

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
tweak the content and then is the

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,760
technical part

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,480
also you know that part we were thinking

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
integrating

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
first with a provider that we though you

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,320
know was the one

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
uh but in the mail we have to actually

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
change the format for

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
all content in order to adapt to a

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
better experience for

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
for the you know for the uh people

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,160
taking the test

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,279
so yeah that part was quite

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
difficult great sounds like we had a lot

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
of

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,040
wonderful experts involved i think we'll

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
learn more about those

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,240
other folks uh soon um we had some

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
questions pre-submitted

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,440
and one question was you know could it

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,680
be possible to have feedback on the exam

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,480
like which exercises were okay which

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
ones were not

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
how do you handle that feedback that's a

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,260
good

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
question um

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,800
[Music]

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,920
we as far as i know

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,760
we we we have the the logistical

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,399
capacity to do that

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,720
uh i don't know that we have uh that

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
that signed off specifically

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
um the only the only mechanism that is

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,040
in place for that

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,160
currently uh is to ask for a manual

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,320
remark

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,480
um which we would prefer

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
to keep at a minimum because of the the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,120
the labor overhead of that

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
um so i think that's something that we

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
should maybe have a discussion about in

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,480
the next

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,279
uh a team meeting uh to see if we can

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
uh provide better feedback on that but

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,320
um

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
the the actual the technical pieces are

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,600
in place to do that

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,839
um so if what we could also do

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
is on on request we could probably

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,240
provide that information

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,000
um so but we don't have a an official

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,720
process for that right now

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,480
um i guess that that comes down to the

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
uh the foundations and how and how we

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,959
want to manage that moving forward

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,040
great well we always have an open door

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,440
you can email me directly or dm

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
us adrian do you want to provide

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,480
something

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,680
a little bit yeah so uh yeah we have the

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,440
i mean uh i guess we have the technical

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,240
uh capacity to do this uh we have data

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,000
right uh i guess it's similar to find a

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,680
way to actually dispose it to

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,560
to every every candidate uh but it's not

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,279
just

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
uh having manual checks which is

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,440
actually

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
you know quite difficult uh you know for

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
your information

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,959
every time someone asks for a manual to

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,680
check

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,440
someone a real person has to actually

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,680
take and validate that code

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
for the whole test for all the items in

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,399
the in the

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:06,000
exam for make sure that uh you know the

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,040
score is right uh 99

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,399
percent i will say is right

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,800
so yeah i guess to integrate a

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,240
feedback will actually decrease that

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
petition because

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,680
at the end is what people is actually

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,399
looking for right

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,320
so they they deserve more i think and

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
it's a good idea we should work toward

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
to have a better solution

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
yeah well there was more of a scientific

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,760
approach you all

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,279
took early on that psychometric analysis

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
do you want to talk a little bit about

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,320
that

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
absolutely um this is this has been a

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,720
fantastic

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,040
fantastic underpinning uh

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
uh thing to this whole process and we

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,600
started with the psychometrician

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,200
uh right right in the beginning um can

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,240
you explain what that is

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,399
a cycle so it's basically the

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,839
the measurement it's basically sort of

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,440
analytical uh sort of an analytical

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,480
feedback loop

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,600
uh on the uh

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,519
efficiency of a question

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,120
to to reveal information about a

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,720
candidate's knowledge

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,240
uh within a given threshold so

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
um there's more there's more to it than

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,839
that we had a psychiatrist who actually

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,279
advised us from the very beginning and

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,240
they were the one who

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,720
gave us the process of even creating uh

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,760
the the certification in the examination

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,240
um but it's really about the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,360
analysis of basically statistical

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,880
analysis

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
of of um how people interact

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,279
with um the examination and what results

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,320
we get

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,360
so if we have too many people uh failing

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,839
a question

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
uh or if we have uh too many people

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
passing a question

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,639
um that that can indicate that we're

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
either with that we're not getting we're

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
not getting the information that we need

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,120
about

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,120
uh the candidates for that for that

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,480
thing it needs to be challenging enough

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
it needs to be within it within the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,279
threshold

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,120
um so we we started off with a

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,199
psychometrician who guided us

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,360
in terms of creating it and then we got

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,120
feedback from them once once the

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
once the tasks were complete and then

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,680
once we deployed it we

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,680
also had uh psychometrician analyze

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,480
um once we had enough people take the

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
exam uh analyze the feedback and then we

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
adjusted

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
we didn't need to adjust any of the

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,160
questions on the services developer exam

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
but we had to just i think

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
three or four on on the application

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
developer which we've actually we've

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
actually not talked about

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,839
uh yet as what the two certifications

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
are um

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,680
right but uh should should we should we

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,560
go

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
should we do that that's a great a good

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,600
idea that's a good idea

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,560
yeah yeah absolutely

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
uh so there are so what we're talking

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
about here

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,120
is the openjs

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
node application developer certification

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,760
and the openjs

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,040
node services developer certification

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,279
um so these are two separate exams

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,399
so two separate exams two separate

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,639
certifications

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
but both kind of interrelated at the

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,199
same time because

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,240
originally we built one um

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,360
but we had uh we measured

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,759
out how long the questions would uh take

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,120
uh as we expected the for for

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
intermediate to up and demean the

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
developer

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,199
and we we realized that we created a

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,480
five hour exam

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,399
which is exhausting yeah so

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,920
we reduced some of the content we

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
reduced we we chopped some of the

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,279
questions and we

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,160
reduced some of the uh intensity of the

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,839
questions

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
uh but that was still too big and so

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,320
then we ended up creating two separate

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,600
exams

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,800
so the the application developer is is

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,120
is uh you're if you if you take that

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240
certification you're demonstrating your

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,079
understanding

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,279
of of node js uh as a whole

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,279
um you you understand how fs

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
the file system module works you

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
understand how

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,639
the node cli works um you understand how

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
streams work

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
um these are all domains that are

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
covered

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:25,360
um the node services developer is

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:29,440
is a more um pragmatic

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:33,040
kind of practical level uh certification

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,839
to do with uh can you create

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
the sort of services that you'll be

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,040
creating uh

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
in a startup or an enterprise on a daily

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,360
basis

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,240
um basically restful json over http

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,519
services

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,519
uh and also security around web servers

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,440
and web services

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,920
do you know how to um secure a web

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,079
server

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,040
against malicious user input for

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,399
instance

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,440
um so these two exams kind of go hand in

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,839
hand

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,280
and if you if you feel you're already

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
proficient with services

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
you could go straight into the services

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
developer or if you feel you're already

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
proficient in node sorry

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,799
you can go straight and take the

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,559
services developer exam but

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
um if you're if you're going on a

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,919
journey through the whole thing

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,640
you should take application developer

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,319
first and then take services developer

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,120
they also differ in uh the

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
the question format so the application

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,440
developer is

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,880
around 27 28 something like that um

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
questions that take maybe five to ten

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,760
minutes each right

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,760
something like that um whereas yeah

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,120
whereas this is it's quite intense

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,160
whereas the services developer is uh

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,679
six questions um and and

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
you need the whole two hours to answer

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,120
those six questions because you have to

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,240
piece things together

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,240
uh and you have to uh yeah essentially

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,840
you know know how to build services from

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,320
scratch

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,440
so there is an easy way to explain you

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,760
know the format

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
so let's say for the application

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
developer

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
certification uh you can solve some

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,240
questions with a single line of code

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:17,440
that's as easy

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,200
you know time and put significant code

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,320
in in in the in the answer right so

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,120
yeah so adrian can you just give us a

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
just a quick

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,160
overview how long do you get how do you

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
take the exam

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,600
just so people have a better

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,799
understanding

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,840
so yeah you will have two hours for both

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,880
uh you know each exam will take up to

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,240
two hours

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
uh you will have uh solve you know the

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
complete test

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,840
in that amount of time uh for the first

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,960
one as dave was explaining

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,679
there are many questions but i i i was

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,200
saying

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,760
uh it sometimes just a single line of

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
code

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,039
will do the trick uh and it's kind of

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,760
the case of

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,960
i'm saying sixty percent of the test so

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
it's kind of

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
so if you know who you know about these

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,240
domains that we're testing about that

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:14,080
is basically a general knowledge of

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,200
you know of node.js api then

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,080
it will be easy right for

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
the services exam is quite different

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,160
it's

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,120
definitely way less questions but those

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
will take

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,640
i would say 10 20 minutes

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,640
maybe top each so you will have like 12

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559
questions i think is what we have right

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,360
now in services

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:43,120
so yeah it's quite a different picture

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,400
can you get a little help along the way

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,320
i mean what can you

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,799
how was it how do you take it do you

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
show up is it online can you check

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,760
documents you can use the documentation

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,799
for sure

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,320
i mean uh we're not testing uh you know

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,720
your memory we are testing your

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,039
understanding of node.js

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,159
so you can access the node.js

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,400
augmentation

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
and remember all these things uh you

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,720
know

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,520
you need but we don't allow to use

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,520
stack overflow and similar sites like we

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,960
don't want you to be copy-pasting code

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
from anywhere so

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,799
it's basically uh you can access the

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
tools required to

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,000
you know make you remember how to solve

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
the exercise

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
but no actually copying and pasting

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
without knowing

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,799
you you know if that's gonna solve it or

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
not

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,400
so so yeah basically you

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
schedule your exam you can actually pay

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,159
for the exam and

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,200
schedule it for later you can you know

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
we have some time

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,760
some special pricing for it uh so you

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
can take advantage of those

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,400
and then schedule for later so that will

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,960
give you the time to study

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
we supply some materials to study we

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,000
suggest some

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,600
right but the main source is not just

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,400
expectation of course

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:06,480
and when you

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,559
nope adrian we lost your audio for a sec

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
can you hear me now we can hear you you

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,640
said we could check

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,480
no js documentation of course

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
yeah of course you can check not just

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
documentation so when you're going to

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
actually take the test

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,360
uh so you will show up at the schedule

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,600
time

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,360
and will be someone actually you know

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,799
seeing all your activity

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,480
uh in the exam you will use a single

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,799
browser window to

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,120
you know to take the test this browser

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,080
window is connected to a linux machine

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,799
uh you will have a linux desktop uh you

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,159
will have

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,640
chrome and visual studio code beam and

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,480
uh webstorm editor that you can use to

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,000
actually solve the exercise

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,200
and and yeah so from there

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,600
is your knowledge and that machine

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
so you will have two hours to complete

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
something so

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,600
easy easy to take at home during

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,440
quarantine

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:07,520
for sure all remote

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,200
great um we did have a question on price

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,600
and said it would be nice to have price

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,159
differentiation based on country

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,280
they feel the price at the price of the

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
certification

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,440
is too high especially for some folks

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,880
uh this person said they're from india

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
can we please look into that

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
that is a great question and it's one

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,039
that we've been

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,840
uh going over uh since the beginning

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,799
actually

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,919
even in even in austin we discussed this

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,159
um

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,240
but it's it's a case of uh the

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,080
uh there i as far as i understand

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,840
there's some to summarize the situation

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,600
and i think robin you you know way more

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,640
about this than me to be honest

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,559
um the situation is

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
there's there's logistical complexity

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,840
involved in geo pricing

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,039
um and it's it's difficult to uh

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,320
to do it in a way that doesn't

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:11,200
ultimately lead to uh the lowest uh

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:15,840
price um if worldwide because of vpns

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,480
um so we rather than doing geopricing

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,520
uh we're looking at approaching that a

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,799
different way

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,480
um around scholarships um

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,080
and organizations um and um

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,120
yeah funneling um essentially

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,880
um funding from the foundation

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,679
into uh into those scholarships um

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
that does mean that uh it's extremely

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
important

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
that if you're a member of an

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,760
organization say in in india like uh

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,200
like a meet-up or um

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,640
or a larger maybe uh sort of

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,159
developers or org of different kinds

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,559
uh that they get in touch with the open

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,919
js foundation um so that we can create

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
those connections to

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,600
to deliver those scholarships through

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
but i'll i'll let you take over here

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
from here robin because you know

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,240
way more about this i think you put a

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
blog post about this yeah we

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
we did blog i think it was shortly after

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,760
i joined uh the price

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
the full price of the certification is

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,559
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,240
uh we try to offer many sales throughout

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,240
the year

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
you know the kind of the pre-holiday

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,960
sale in november

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
is always a big one um often around our

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
conferences

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,679
um in summer so if if

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
um i would really encourage you to look

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
at that i'd encourage you to talk to

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
your employer

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,400
and we could perhaps offer some

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,679
corporate discounts and and kind of a

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
group sales

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,200
um but again if if you all really want

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,200
to take the exam

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
um until we have the scholarship program

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,799
in place i'd encourage you to to reach

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,360
out to us or if you're

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,799
a non-profit and can help us scale some

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,039
of those programs that would be great

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,039
too

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,960
cool um before i get into some other

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
things

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
one of the other questions we had

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,919
pre-submitted

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,360
was what criteria do you use to choose

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,360
new npm packages

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,960
that's a good one yeah yeah you go first

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,000
adrian and then i'll take it as well

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,799
it's a big question oh i'm a bit biased

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,679
in that one

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
anyway so i will try to explain as much

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,360
as

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,840
uh you know okay let's see so for me

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,400
it's important

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,440
the community behind a tool that i'm

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
going to use

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
all the time so the first parameter i

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,679
will choose is

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,640
uh if this tool is being used and been

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,039
supported by

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,480
the community right talking about open

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,279
source

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
so i will check the activity in github

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,720
you know

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,080
if this is a not very uh

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,720
you know knowledge

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,279
module then i will definitely go and

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
check

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,360
all the activity there and see how many

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
versions they released

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,240
last year and

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,159
that's the first thing the second thing

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,480
i do is to check dependencies

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,000
because that's important right so you

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,039
need to know uh

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,279
maybe the module is solid and is

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,400
pretty well maintained but has some

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,760
dependencies that

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,960
definitely you know uh are not as good

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,200
so that's the second parameter i use uh

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,159
and the tier parameter i use is a tool

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
my company does

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,440
uh is not certified modules

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,520
which basically is a security scanner

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,640
and quality scanner for modules

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:40,000
so if i after the first two parameters i

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,400
i had the module is good i just run this

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,679
tool

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,360
and it comes clean then that's how i

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,000
adopt a new module in my in my projects

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,559
i guess david has a different view for

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
this

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,640
yeah no no disagreements there um but i

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,279
would just add more

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,240
uh nuance to the the selection process

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,640
and the evaluation process so basically

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,919
um there isn't really a one shoe fits

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
all because you

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
you have to consider what it is you're

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,240
even looking at right

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,679
so if you're if you're looking at a

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,720
utility module

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,159
um that does something specific

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,360
um then that's very different to looking

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,440
at a framework

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,640
because what a framework does is it

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,320
solves

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,679
many problems for many different people

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,600
that want in one go

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
so a framework that's gotten any level

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,720
of success is going to have a lot of

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,159
github stars

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,320
right and it's going to have a lot of

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,520
downloads as well um

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,600
but a utility module that's niche

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,039
it might not have any stars at all so

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
you have to evaluate it on a different

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,919
basis

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,440
so you you have two major approaches in

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
the ecosystem you find this more with

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,520
node

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
than with the front end on the front end

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
it's the it's more of a framework

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,919
approach in general

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
on on the back end of node there's the

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,679
frameworks and then there's

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
there's individual modules and in some

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,559
cases the frameworks are actually made

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,480
of individual modules but

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,120
if you take someone like matthias booze

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,159
who's uh alice's mafintosh

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,919
or um cindasaurus these two authors

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,240
they're prolific in that they they

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
create and sub stack and dominic barry

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,000
are the older guys of this but they

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,960
create lots and lots and lots of small

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,880
modules

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
so on those ones i just named four

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
authors and those are four authors that

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,960
i trust

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,440
because i've seen their work and they're

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
consistently good so when it's a small

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,559
module by one of those authors something

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
specific that i want to do

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,679
i'm less interested in the download

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,399
count and the stars

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
and i'm more interested in uh the the

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,679
problem that they solved

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,919
also typically with these kind of

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,000
modules is that they're very small so

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
you know you're a programmer you're a

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,240
developer you can go and look at the

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,159
code on

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,679
on github and see the quality of it and

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,240
see how they've done it and actually

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
that can really help you uh get inspired

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,520
and actually

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,640
uh even change the way that you approach

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,760
problems

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,159
when it comes to frameworks it's

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,240
different because um that

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,600
that can just be pure downloads and pure

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,919
framework uh

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,840
sorry pure and github stars but that

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,760
leads to another issue

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,919
um if you're looking at frameworks uh

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,360
for a large org strategy

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,880
so say you're you're part of an

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,399
enterprise company and you're all

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
collectively deciding hey

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,080
what framework should we be using for

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,799
http right

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,600
um and and the big ones in space are

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,559
happy

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,760
um express classified um and so forth um

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,000
so um you can

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,120
look at the downloads of of the

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,480
framework

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,360
uh and be blown away by the sheer amount

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,840
of them

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,440
but that doesn't necessarily means that

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
you should opt with that framework

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,720
because

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
at a certain point uh the network effect

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
kicks in

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,000
where downloads occur because downloads

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
are occurring

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,679
um so you you also have to be careful

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,960
with the way that you evaluate that you

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
need to look at the age of the project

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,279
you need to look at

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,000
when uh when was it last updated

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,640
what are the commitments by the uh by

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
the team

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,679
behind that web framework to

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,440
release schedules what are the

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,840
commitments to maintaining

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,360
uh older versions um how have they

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,960
behaved in the past

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,480
so like these are all things to take

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,720
into account as well

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
when it comes with to like you know

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,760
larger decisions around frameworks

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,919
too so it's always it's always you have

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,559
to contextualize the the decision you're

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
making

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,399
the one final thing on this is when

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
you're when you're looking at

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,520
uh a module as i say about the release

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,520
schedule you expect a good

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,120
a good release schedule commitment for

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
frameworks right particularly in the

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,399
node ecosystem it moves very quickly

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,520
javascript moves very quickly

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,480
um node moves very quickly versus other

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
platforms

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,919
but when we're talking about small

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
modules again there can be a module

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,000
that's not been touched for two years

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,320
and it's still

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,200
perfect for your use case because some

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,600
things they're not

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,440
moving targets some things are just like

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,240
i need something to convert say

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,440
rgb to hsl like that's that's a that's a

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,279
fixed problem

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,559
other things they are moving targets so

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,880
you need to define like

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
what is it that you're looking for um

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,399
what are the attributes of it

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,559
and then you assess based on those other

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,440
criteria that adrian was talking about

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,519
um and also just uh build it build up a

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,159
repertoire of authors that you trust

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
um uh that and you you can kind of you

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,360
can kind of kind of figure

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,559
that out also by doing research and also

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,120
just the amount of modules that they

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,080
produce

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,360
like it indicates their their level of

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,600
quality as well because if

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,120
if you've got someone who's produced 780

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,720
modules for instance like

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,919
yeah there might be a couple of bad ones

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,519
in there when they were first starting

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,679
out but eventually they've gone into a

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,360
flow where it's pretty good

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,880
and then it'll fix the odd ones yeah

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,559
super interesting i feel like that

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,720
that's like a blog waiting to be written

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,159
um we had a question came in that just

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,279
came in from twitter

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,240
uh on again using node.js documentation

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,120
during the exam

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,360
are test takers able to use google or

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,320
mdn

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,760
you can use both i mean yes uh we don't

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,279
have a problem for you

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,840
googling or checking any documentation

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,519
you know the only you know condition

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,399
there is basically don't use stack

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,240
overflow

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,480
or something like that to copy and paste

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,799
code that's it

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,760
got it it doesn't slow people down i

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,159
mean

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,480
your experience i think what there's a

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,279
link to the documentation on every

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,120
test question right to make it easy for

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,880
folks so

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,320
yeah there's a like a like a sort of a

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
banner thing where you can go to the

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,360
documentation but for

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,200
for mdn there's no there's not a link to

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,679
mdn but um

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,519
we wanted to do we we support doing it

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,640
that way because

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
um we recognize like like the way i

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,600
develop

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,159
i don't retain uh information in my head

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,039
i retain references in my head if that

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,080
makes sense

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,799
so i forget how to use splice all the

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,640
time

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,200
and then i have to go and search it and

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,559
so it's fine to do that it's totally

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,159
fine to do that that's a totally

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,320
legitimate way to develop

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
where we draw the line is going on to

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,360
say stack overflow like adrian mentioned

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,640
and just cargo culting because you we

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
can't establish that you know what

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
you're doing

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,039
if you're just copying and pasting

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,000
pre-written examples um so

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,200
that's where we strike the balance got

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,640
it

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,840
um let's talk about why somebody

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,320
might want to take this exam or both

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,320
exams

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,559
what value and benefit somebody

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,200
do you want to go first adrian i'm kind

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,200
of out of breath

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,159
okay well um so the exam is a tool

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,120
right it's a tool to certify that you

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,960
are uh

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
you have the knowledge required to be

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,720
certified at node.js

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,760
so it's definitely something that the

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,880
industry can

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,600
use and the you know the applicants to

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
jobs can use to demonstrate their their

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,320
knowledge

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,559
so there are some stories are worried

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
about this people actually taking the

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,079
certification

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,040
and demanding uh and some job

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,760
post-demanding

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,079
certification to to you know this will

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,800
avoid the complexity of hiring which is

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,520
uh

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,119
unknown problem for the industry uh so

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,240
it's definitely a tool that

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
could you you know help in that spectrum

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,520
a lot

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:32,399
so great basically

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,399
yeah um

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,480
we need in this industry

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,919
we need some way of measuring we need an

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,359
absolute measure

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,919
um we need a kpi

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,399
that is that has that is a line across

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,679
the entire industry um

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,079
a kpi a key performance indicator yes

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,119
yeah

00:34:52,079 --> 00:35:00,560
yeah um because

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:04,000
to be very candid there

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,760
the javascript space is very large

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,960
um and there's a lot of opportunity for

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,960
creating uh um

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,440
creating the illusion of seniority

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,839
without really having it and there's

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,880
there's multiple reasons for this so

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
um and you can you

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,359
when we think of a senior javascript

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
developer again it's very much dependent

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,960
on context

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,720
so the first thing is um

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,599
in in an enterprise company seniority

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,040
isn't really if we're honest about it it

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,440
isn't really about how

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,240
proficient you are in the language it's

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,839
about

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,040
how much you've understood the business

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,079
domain and then being able to apply

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,640
your current level of the language to

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,200
uh solving for that business domain so

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
people are are often promoted to senior

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,960
developer

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,839
uh in in enterprise companies not all

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,000
the time but

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,520
this is a general trend i've observed in

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,839
as part of my consultancy

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,720
based on their their their business

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,280
domain knowledge

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,040
and that's that's totally okay but when

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,400
you're looking to hire

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,960
you're you're looking to hire not based

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,160
on

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,000
necessarily the business domain

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,560
knowledge you're looking to hire based

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,520
on

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,400
the programming skill level and the

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,640
generic

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,000
capabilities of being able to do that

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,839
transformation from business

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
into um into a good quality

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,880
code that that doesn't that doesn't

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,280
necessarily

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,400
incur huge technical depth right because

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,359
the the problem

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,680
is that if you're not at a an

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,440
intermediate to upper intermediate level

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,079
the the kind of technical debt you leave

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,800
behind sets off a chain reaction

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
that causes the projects to have to be

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,599
rewritten

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,040
essentially every two years and this is

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,880
a huge business cost

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,880
it's huge so by having this

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:08,320
um standard in the industry um

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,440
we we can we are providing

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,839
um a stamp of approval for anyone who

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,079
wants to take this to say yes

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:21,359
this person is has what it takes

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,359
to at a minimum

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,800
convert business domain problems into

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,000
solutions that have a certain level of

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
quality to them

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,520
to reduce that technical debt that

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,520
builds up over time

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560
um so we encourage people to take it

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,240
because

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,079
um it it's good for the industry

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,240
in general it's good for the community

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,359
in general um

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,720
it's it's it's there is some

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,280
the other thing i'll address as well is

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,280
that there is some hesitation around

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,119
certifications because

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,720
um uh they have been seen in the past as

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,480
gatekeeping and i do believe that there

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,400
are certifications that are like that

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,599
um particularly ones with very high

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
price points

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,640
um it it it definitely skews to

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,320
the people that have the luxury and the

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,359
privilege to be able to afford those

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,560
or who have already got employers that

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,480
can pay for them

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,000
for them um for those people

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,640
yes we need to address the the disparity

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,920
the global disparity of it but this exam

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,960
relative to other exams

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,079
is very affordable compared to those

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,640
other exams

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:37,920
um and so this is a this is a route

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,119
to uh to entering the space or to

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,960
uh leveling up in the space uh

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,040
that that is compatible with other

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,599
routes right um people go through the

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,520
boot

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,040
camps they go through getting degrees

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,880
and these these are these are very

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,040
different things like a four-year degree

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,160
versus a nine-week boot camp they are

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,520
different things

00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,160
um this in this one in this in itself is

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,160
a learn at your own pace um we haven't

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,680
talked about self the the the linux

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,760
training yet but i'm sure we'll come to

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
that uh this is a you know learn at your

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,839
own pace

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,040
uh thing um that you can

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,160
uh sort of go as fast or slow as you

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,920
want uh

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,040
to get this this uh this verification is

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,720
validation

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,800
uh that that you that you know what

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,200
you're doing and it's as simple as that

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,240
i love that that levels the playing

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,760
field for

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,599
developers yeah for sure adrian did you

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,680
have anything to add

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,520
no that's pretty interesting yeah i

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,119
think uh um

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,720
the linux foundation training and

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,040
certification team they're

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,280
world class and uh we're supported by

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,839
them with our experts

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
um can you talk about after you complete

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,079
the exam and

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,480
how do you how do you

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,480
demonstrate that capability publicly

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,240
or should i explain the the whole

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,720
digital badge

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,720
concept

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,280
or you want me to solve this do you want

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
to take it

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,599
charge my earphones for a second oh okay

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
i'm sorry i thought you were talking

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,480
about that

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,560
okay uh so yeah when you get certified

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,839
you get a batch that you can

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,359
publish on your uh profiles so on your

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,839
social profiles you can

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,280
actually work this badge and demonstrate

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,480
that you're certified

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,040
uh by the open js foundation and yeah

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
definitely

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,240
something you really would like to have

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,359
in your linkedin profile

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,359
for example so yeah people

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,880
looking for node.js developers

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,000
definitely will take a look at those

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
badges

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,960
yeah it's true i think the last in

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,560
person conference i went to i was

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,560
talking to some recruiters

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,720
there and they were saying no developers

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,720
are kind of in the top three

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,640
categories of devs that they're hiring

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:56,400
so that's that's super cool um

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,839
let's see another question that we had

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,160
is um you all had talked about this

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,079
in one of your breakout sessions you did

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,520
at openjs world which i thought was

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,960
pretty interesting

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,480
about some of the um the kind of

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,240
you had talked you touched on it earlier

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,440
but can you expand on some of the

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,880
principles and

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,880
that you really put in place before you

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:25,200
establish the exam

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
uh yeah um so we wanted it to be

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,880
i hope hopefully the sound is coming

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,160
across okay here we wanted it to be

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,160
um practical in nature

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,200
um we don't we're not

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,079
we work we we kind of set a line in the

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,960
stand early on that we we want to avoid

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,839
kind of uh steering into a puzzle

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,200
solving

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,920
uh dynamic um we're not trying to catch

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,680
you out

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,119
uh we're not trying to do weird brain

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,440
puzzles it it's

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,800
um it's that classic kind of criticism

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
of a lot of the

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,240
the interviewing techniques in the

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,200
industry um around

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,920
you know uh not really real world

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,520
problems

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,200
that that are more about like brain

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,839
teaser kind of style

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,640
that's not what we wanted to do and we i

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,599
believe that we

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,720
we achieved that um uh based on the

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,760
testimonials we've got some great

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,560
testimonials that

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,240
that say things like um i like how this

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,119
mirrors real world problems

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,680
so what we what the approach that we

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,000
took is

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,160
we took the domain and we took the topic

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,640
and we we made tasks out of that that

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,880
would

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,280
in some way relate to something that you

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,960
would probably do in your day job

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,280
particularly for the services exam but

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,720
also to an extent for the application

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,000
uh developer exam as well

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,160
so it's about problem solving it's

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,119
not about puzzle solving it's it's about

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,560
providing

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,560
uh a solution to uh a problem

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,760
that you're likely to face in the real

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
world even if

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
to a certain sense it is contrived and

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,880
it is abstracted

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,560
um it's close enough that you can make

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,240
that jump in your mind to

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,000
uh when when you actually come to face

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,040
that problem and go oh yeah

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,359
um i can do this that bridges that gap

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,040
um so that's that's really the main

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,480
drive and the main philosophy

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,000
and um it's if i can plug my cookbook

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,520
i wrote a book called node cookbook it's

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
currently in its third edition

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
and from the from the first edition um

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
it was always about that it was always

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,839
about

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,760
hands-on practical ways of learning

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,040
because it's how i learn

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
and this is one of the reasons i love

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,240
javascript i love that

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,040
and it's another reason i learn the

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,960
first language i i learned was basic

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,480
um because they both javascript and

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
basic both share the same

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,000
thing where you you you put something

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,920
into the

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,200
the command line or the rapple and you

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,640
get something out straight away

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,400
that's why i love dev tools and playing

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,319
around in that so you have this

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,680
this kind of pragmatic feedback it's

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,480
it's it doesn't get lost in a

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,319
theoretical

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,000
you don't have to retain so much state

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,640
in your mind before you kind of

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
press the button um and and that that

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,119
same

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,400
mindset for me is translated to the book

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,000
and it's translated to

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,480
uh the way that we did the certification

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,319
as well right it does sound much more

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,280
approachable i think than maybe a

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,119
certification

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
sounds you think theory and yeah

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,520
complexity puzzles

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,040
um how much experience maybe adrian you

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,119
can touch on this how much experience

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,319
should somebody have

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,440
before they take the exam like

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,480
okay that's a bit freaky it's a hard

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,720
question

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,079
but it's i think we get all the time

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,200
yeah i mean

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,520
uh okay let's uh split this answer in

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,720
two

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,839
so for uh application development exam

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,720
uh you definitely need some good general

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,079
knowledge about

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,640
node so what i would recommend is if you

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,400
don't have a lot of experience with node

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,079
go over documentation for all different

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,800
domains that we test

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,720
uh those are describing the you know in

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,359
the example file

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,079
so you can see all different topics that

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,280
you will be

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,040
uh you know facing so

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,680
yeah go over that documentation really

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,480
really really well because

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,400
all the answers are basically there so

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,200
that one is easier to take it

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,400
you know for someone that is starting

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,599
with no

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,119
but for the services uh certification

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,319
you definitely need

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:26,160
some good experience uh writing

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,800
uh applications uh like web servers

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,440
and and no i'm be familiar with

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,119
practices with security practices

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,680
that are required for this kind of

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,599
application so that will require i would

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,359
say like uh

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:42,160
some i would say more than junior

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,520
experience

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,520
in node.js so although

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,640
i would interject that we can fast-track

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
some of that

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,680
because we have the currently we have

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,560
the

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,560
i think it's the lfw12 by the linux

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,960
foundation which is the training for the

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,319
application developer certification

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,480
and there's the uh soon to

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,520
soon to be released services developer

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,880
application

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,599
uh sorry services developer

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,920
certification uh training as well which

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,280
i'm

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,400
which i'm working on and um currently

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,920
um in the middle of of doing and i

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,920
promise i'm going to have it done soon

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,240
yeah i i know the linux foundation

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,200
having the training and the

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,640
certification

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,839
is a great uh way to you know to get

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,960
that whole package

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,839
for sure yeah so i was asked by uh

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,040
uh someone recently uh on twitter dm

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,440
actually several people have asked this

00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,760
is

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,480
if i take the self-help training

00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,599
will i be able to pass the exam and my

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,760
answer was

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,640
as long as you're proficient in

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,839
javascript in general

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,960
you or or at least proficient in a

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,480
programming languages

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,319
in a programming language and you have

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,440
some jobs for familiarity

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,319
and then you take the the the the

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,359
training

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,480
um and you're able to uh

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,119
with reading comprehension uh understand

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,680
the content

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,359
in order to answer the exercises then

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,040
you should be able to pass

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,480
the application developer certification

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,760
we're going to do the same thing with

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,800
the services so you do already need some

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,200
context

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,480
uh but you can level up using the

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,960
self-help training

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,640
uh on the services one coming soon but i

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,040
advise taking the application developer

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,280
one

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,319
first anyway so hey look if you book the

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,160
training you but your

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,680
your exam now by the time you've done

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,240
applications the services one will be

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,119
out

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,880
right so and i think what we're finding

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,240
is people are buying the exam and then

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,680
they're studying and then they're taking

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,400
it what happens i mean

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,720
if they don't pass or you know what do

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,319
you

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,079
what do you recommend you get you get a

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,400
free retake so

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,800
if you don't the thing is as well you

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,559
can schedule it for like six months out

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,720
which for some people works as a

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,200
motivation to do the studying

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,920
um so and again with the retake you can

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,839
schedule that

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,839
a little way out as well so um

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:10,400
definitely um

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,079
for application developer uh take do the

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,359
self-help training because

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:18,839
um or find some training somewhere

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:22,160
um other other tools that can help is is

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:23,520
is you know actually uh looking through

00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,640
the documentation and

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,079
applying the examples from the

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,280
documentation that the node

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,400
documentation is

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
is is quite a good resource um and

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,079
there's also

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,400
i think we have some other things in the

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,520
reading list including the cookbook that

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,400
i plugged earlier

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,520
um it is for a slightly it says for note

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,760
8 but it still

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:47,119
completely applies to 10 and 12. um so

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,480
yeah um those are good resources as well

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,760
but at a very at a baseline you need to

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,119
know javascript

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,960
to a degree like to do it to not to not

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,839
sorry to a certain level you don't have

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,960
to do between hospitals

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,400
to to to pass these exams um what we

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,400
could do what we should do

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,760
uh is a javascript certification just

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,359
pure javascript but

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,400
that's a different conversation cool

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,559
um so we just launched the certification

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,240
program in chinese

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:23,839
why don't you both talk about sort of

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,680
how that came together and some of the

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,880
challenges you had to overcome

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,839
to implement a certification program in

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,839
a different language

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,599
i'll take i'll take this one first uh

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,119
and then adrian if you want to fill

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,800
anything in

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,960
this has been a real fun experience

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,839
actually um

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,480
i'm gonna get real braggy right now

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,400
because um

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,920
the node cookbook was actually

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,040
translated into

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,720
uh korean and japanese the first edition

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,000
and so it's been really awesome to see

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,960
the certification translated into

00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,640
mandarin

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,400
and so i've had a little bit of

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,200
experience with that process before

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,880
um really on this one it's it's been

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,319
quite smooth because of the

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,559
the the level of the of the translator

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,359
uh that's been working with us on this

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,559
um

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,280
and also uh um with with uh

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,880
the daniel in in the foundation uh

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,040
coordinating things

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:24,480
um so it's really just been a case of

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:28,400
what the main the main challenge was

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,520
uh marking out words that

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,920
we feel uh would would

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,359
remain in english in other languages

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,319
which is a really hard thing to do

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,680
because

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,280
um different languages have different

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,440
completely different sort of cultures

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,079
and ways they construct language and

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,400
stuff

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,280
but you know the when it comes to

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,200
programming

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,319
generally you're programming in english

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,480
and so there's

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,559
there's terms where we're like well we

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,839
know this is code we're talking about

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,359
you know returning from a function or

00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,079
something but there's other terms that

00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,559
are kind of

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,079
the kind of pathway example words that

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,960
you didn't translate

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,119
what are some yeah so when we talk about

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,520
piping from one stream to another

00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,440
well we're referring to the stream pipe

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,440
method but we're saying piping so

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,040
it's not a method so we can't put it in

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,000
code format

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,960
but um in order to have like the

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,319
fairness

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,680
of like of like indicating that to

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,119
a mandarin speaker then we keep that

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,040
word to say piping

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,240
but then ultimately it's up to the

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,960
translator

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,440
uh to to decide that because it might

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,880
make more sense in mandarin to actually

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,440
translate that or not

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,400
so we we had to mark out i guess i don't

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,960
know it's about like a

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,839
uh maybe 150 words was it maybe 100

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,440
words

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,599
throughout all of certification that we

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,240
that we had to sort of mark out as like

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,319
hey this is actually like a term that

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,359
you may or may not need to translate

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,559
um that was the main effort but uh um it

00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,400
went very smoothly

00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,599
and i'm really excited about it's so

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,599
cool to see

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,240
um you know stuff that you you've

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,800
written in in mandarin and then the code

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,240
snippets and stuff so um yeah we're

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,640
really excited about that i'm excited to

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,440
see

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,520
how how that's taken up in in in those

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,920
markets

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,960
uh what i really love about this process

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,160
was you know

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:24,000
uh so uh it was

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,520
kind of easy i mean well it wasn't easy

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,599
for the translators but

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,839
i mean the process was really smooth for

00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,040
uh for the exam and the infrastructure

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,079
we already had

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,359
so and what is what exciting the most

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,920
for me is basically uh that this opens

00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:40,960
the door

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,040
to future translations and i

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,960
definitely you know like to see this

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,800
translated to spanish for example

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,640
that would help a lot of latino american

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,520
people to actually take the test

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,760
uh you know removing this barrier is

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,760
awesome

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,040
yeah remember the first conversations

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,800
it's like do we need

00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,960
to do you need to program for different

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,240
keyboards and all kinds of things and it

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
actually

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,760
ended up um and the great thing is we

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,119
had a couple of uh

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,559
node.js contributors in china volunteer

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,800
their time

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,400
and we have a blog about them um who

00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,720
provided that uh

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,000
great uh contributor from alibaba so

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,280
that was pretty cool

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,359
yeah amazing yeah it was vivian lin was

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,240
the the translator the main translator

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,280
and then it was uh joy and sorry who was

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,960
it the other ones

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,359
that helped out no core one um

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,000
i'd have to look up her look up the name

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,040
quickly

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,079
in the blog but we uh we just posted a

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,359
blog i believe

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,119
a couple of weeks ago on that and we'll

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,400
we'll be doing a feature another feature

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,599
soon

00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,520
cool yeah i don't know if now we've

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,400
talked chinese did we talk versions

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,440
i know we talk we talk packages we i

00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,800
don't think talked about

00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,359
version node versions right yeah this is

00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,720
a big topic as well we only have about

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,160
five or six minutes left

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,680
but i think it was something that we

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,640
maybe missed that we should probably hit

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,800
before we

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,920
wrap yeah we should totally cover that

00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,760
um so

00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,680
currently the certification is for node

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,200
12. actually

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:19,359
we stapled to i think it's no 12.3

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,680
um because of um ecmascript modules um

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,720
the examination was written before

00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,680
ecmascript modules

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,319
uh were put in were introduced into node

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
um

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,520
they've been introduced but they're

00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,960
actually experimental

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,559
in the documentation they are

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,440
experimental and we're not

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,079
supporting experimental features i

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,359
believe

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,400
the the intention with node core

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,359
is for node 14 uh to

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,920
take them out of being experimental by

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,280
the time

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,200
node 14 becomes ltx so um there's a

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,079
release schedule with node

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,799
where you have the the current which is

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,559
the

00:54:54,799 --> 00:55:00,640
uh um which is currently node 14

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,680
and then you have the lts the long term

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,839
support version

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,000
which is currently node 12. um

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,880
uh the lts versions overlap at some

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,720
point where

00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,920
a current version becomes a long-term

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,559
support version

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,200
um and that's happening with node node

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,640
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,319
in october so we with the certification

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,760
we want to map to

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:27,280
uh the at least the earliest

00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:31,520
uh lts version so it will be on node 12.

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,839
um but uh so for instance in this april

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,599
uh node 10 went from lts into

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:39,359
maintenance and we had 12 and 10

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:42,720
in lts so we updated from 10

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,359
to 12 in april um what we might do this

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,079
year

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,880
is go to the very latest lts and upgrade

00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,319
to

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,880

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,000

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,599
october so

00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,520
we're we're mapping the the

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,160
certification has an evergreen quality

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,359
to it

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,400
where we're mapping to the the the lts

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,160
version of node

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,160
um preferably the latest which is what

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,559
we're aiming for um

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,079
and we also assess that you know based

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,799
on the content based on changes in the

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,440
industry

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,000
and all that kind of thing so um we want

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,440

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,280
fair we don't we're not trying to

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,119
increase the difficulty at all but we're

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,000
trying to keep it relevant and keep it

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,559
up to date

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,760
