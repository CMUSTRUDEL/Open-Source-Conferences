(car horn honking in the distance)

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,373
- Okay.

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,333
We are live on YouTube.

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,140
So, hello, everybody.

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,243
Okay.

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,553
And welcome.

00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:34,153
We are live on YouTube.

00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,230
- Are you getting feedback?

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,070
- [Rachel] I am.

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,535
I just muted us.

00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:39,368
- [Manil] Oh.

00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,602
- Sorry about that, y'all.

00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:41,435
(laughing)

00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:42,680
Okay, that better, everybody?

00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,337
Okay, awesome.

00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,834
Hi, everybody.

00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,490
We are live right now

00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,490
with the Node.js Community Committee

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,773
for the OpenJS Foundation series, or AMAs,

00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,640
and today, again, we'll be talking

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,700
to the Node.js Community Committee.

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,470
My name is Rachel Romoff,

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,970
and I support the OpenJS Foundation

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,330
for marketing and communications,

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,880
and before we get started with these questions,

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,970
I think it would be good

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,850
to jump in

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,630
and do some introductions

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,350
with the folks who are joining us today.

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,533
So, I don't know who wants to kick us off.

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
- [Tierney] I will.

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,260
- [Rachel] Perfect.

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,130
- Cool.

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,090
Hi, everyone.

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,480
I'm Tierney Cyren.

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,313
I'm a Senior Cloud Developer at Microsoft.

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,330
I'm currently Chairperson

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,093
of the Node.js Community Committee,

00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,660
and I'm involved in various other open source projects,

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,190
whether it's Electronic Outreach Working Group,

00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,730
I'm involved in TC39,

00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,620
and also spend a trivial amount of time

00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,023
on the OpenJS Foundation.

00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,453
Yeah.

00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,940
Adam, do you wanna go next?

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
- Yeah.

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,400
So, my name is Adam Miller.

00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm a software engineer out in San Francisco,

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,390
previously helping run design systems at Linked In,

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,840
and most recently for the last month,

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,670
month and a half, been focused full time

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,520
on political campaign sec,

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,963
which has been a blast.

00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:29,590
I previously was serving as the Chairperson

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,687
for the Community Committee.

00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,750
So, Tierney took over about,

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,080
how long has it been, Tierney?

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,610
Two months?

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,610
Something like that?

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,570
Also involved with an assortment

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,520
of other open source projects,

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,913
CSS Blocks, Vapid.

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,100
Front end is the name of the game here.

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,313
Yeah, excited to be talking to y'all.

00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:51,603
Manil, take it away.

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,423
- Thanks, Adam.

00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
Hi, folks.

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,573
I'm Manil Chowdhury.

00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,830
I am currently Developer Advocate at InVision,

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,630
previously a engineer at Digitalist Global.

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,560
I am involved in the CommComm as a member,

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,003
since, I believe, early 2018.

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,234
Prior to that, I started computer programming

00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,283
probably in late 2017,

00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,065
and right now I'm involved in a couple

00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:25,600
of open source communities and initiative assortments,

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,300
some local, some on the interwebs.

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,070
Glad to be here.

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,063
Excited to discuss CommComm with all of your folks.

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,330
- Awesome.

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,810
Well, thank you all so much for joining us this morning.

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,300
We can jump right in to questions,

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,970
but before we do,

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,590
for those who have questions for the CommComm,

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,550
please feel free to drop those

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,350
in our YouTube chat,

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,460
and we will get to those questions.

00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,464
And so, jumping right in,

00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:57,297
the first question we have

00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:02,100
is what is Community Committee to Node.js?

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,420
What is its relationship to the OpenJS Foundation,

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,383
and what purpose does it serve?

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,690
- I'll start off this one.

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,333
So, the Community Committee to Node.js.

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,770
So, I'm gonna kinda answer the first and last

00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,330
at the same time.

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,844
The Community Committee is intended

00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:25,680
to help address

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,870
community-focused things,

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,370
so outward facing efforts.

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,710
So typically, in my perception,

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,206
the TSC, the Typical Steering Committee,

00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,620
the body that governs a lot

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,790
of the technical internal sides of Node,

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,980
whether that's Core

00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,997
or the various, I think, 160 repos,

00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,169
some of those are ours,

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,493
but 100-ish repos that they govern,

00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,720
those are typically internal-facing things,

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,180
whereas the Community Committee typically focuses

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,820
on more external facing things.

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,220
This is like mentorship

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,200
and that initiative

00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:09,347
or the website redesign initiative

00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,360
or the outreach initiative,

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,640
various other things that are intended

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,863
to be outward-facing;

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,930
and then, in terms of its relationship

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,803
with the OpenJS Foundation,

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,540
the Node.js Community Committee

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,390
was very active in participating

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,272
in the transition

00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,240
from the Node.js Foundation

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,370
to the OpenJS Foundation,

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,580
specifically in terms of community

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,150
and ecosystem impact.

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,820
That was something that myself and many other folks

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,970
who are on the CommComm

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,683
care a lot about,

00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,063
and that's the area that we generally focus on already,

00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,900
and so it was a natural fit for us

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
to be able to participate in that way

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,170
in the formation

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,760
of the new foundation;

00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,630
and then, on top of that,

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,250
we currently participate,

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,200
I believe two members,

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,820
myself as a regular member,

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,520
and then Joe Sepi

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,920
as a voting member from the Node.js Project

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,300
on the CPC,

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,890
so the Cross Project Council for the Node.js Foundation.

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,510
So, our goal generally

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,746
is to help empower the developers

00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,430
who are in Node.js

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,640
or who have used Node.js.

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,390
So, according the MPM statistics,

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,843
11 million developers,

00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,520
but empower every single one of those

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,449
to find more success

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,193
with JavaScript and with Node.

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,930
- Yeah, and something that I absolutely love

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,670
about the Node community

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,240
is how they have codified in the governance structure

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,450
this acknowledgment that open source

00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,250
is more than just the source code of the project.

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,620
It's about the entire community

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,880
that develops around it,

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,470
and it's about the entire experience

00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,020
of anybody who engages with it,

00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,380
and the Community Committee, in my mind,

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,680
is something there to help

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,190
usher that community

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,070
through to fruition, is the wrong word,

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,363
but with some degree of clarity;

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,930
and so, all the projects associated with that

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,620
are very focused

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,490
on the people

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,820
that are engaging with the project,

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,060
whether it is a consumer of it,

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,690
somebody who's using Node for their work,

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,940
or for their side product,

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,843
or just for fun.

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,410
Hopefully, your side projects are fun.

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,200
Or, if it's even contributors in the community.

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,070
So, if you're looking to get onboarded

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,373
to contribute to Core,

00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,570
or if you're looking to get involved in the project

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,403
in some way

00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,702
that's not actually a code contribution

00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:48,550
because the unofficial motto of the community

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,453
is not all contributions are code,

00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,857
and we're here to help facilitate that.

00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:59,133
- And if any of that sounds good to you,

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,540
like Tierney mentioned,

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,297
the CommComm was heavily involved

00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,970
in the transition

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,630
from the Node.js Foundation to OpenJS,

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,060
and a lot of the spirit of what CommComm

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,840
liked bringing to the community

00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,000
was transferred as part of that process,

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
and the continued involvement of some people in CommComm,

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,913
like Tierney mentioned earlier,

00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:25,967
it continues to (audio cuts out).

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,193
- Awesome.

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,380
So, for the next question

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,850
is what are the priorities

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,513
for CommComm right now?

00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,477
- So, this is a good one.

00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,143
Generally, about around this time,

00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,210
we come together as a committee

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,680
at the Collaborator Summit

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,030
at Node Plus JS Interactive

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,030
to discuss this

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,190
and focusing on building out,

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,890
hopefully I'm not lagging too bad,

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,770
but we end up coming together at Node Plus JS Interactive

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,395
at the Collaborator Summit

00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,228
and building out

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,680
what we're working toward or looking at

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,513
for next year,

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,910
or for the whole

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,150
of the next year,

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,150
until we meet again.

00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,490
So, right now we're wrapping up

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,440
a lot of the things

00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,433
that we started or agreed on last year,

00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:46,200
and are coming up on that session again;

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
however, there are a few things

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,460
that we're getting to do.

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,460
The OpenJS, Node.js joining the OpenJS Foundation

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,640
gave us an opportunity to tweak

00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,470
and clean up

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,470
some of our existing infrastructure and governance.

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,890
So, we're going through and doing a lot of that right now.

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,530
Additionally, we're introducing,

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,080
or I'm hoping we're introducing,

00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,880
but we're working toward introducing

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,590
a little bit more structure into how we can actually ensure

00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,480
that our initiatives are successful

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,700
and building out more structure

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,223
on how we can enable that success,

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,800
specifically, one of the discussions that I proposed

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,080
is OKRs for the CommComm,

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,173
which is inspired by what Electron does,

00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:43,246
but yeah, we're moving

00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:45,810
toward being a little bit more lean,

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,410
a little bit more goal-oriented,

00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:51,310
and that will trickle down

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,390
to every single aspect of CommComm,

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,830
every initiative, whether it's website redesign,

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,830
or mentorship, or social media stuff that we're doing,

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,570
or various aspects of the work

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,913
we are already doing.

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,196
- Yeah.

00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:11,860
What might be a good way to approach this

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,107
is just go to the list of working groups

00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,358
and the initiatives we have in the CommComm

00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:20,840
because the CommComm itself

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,520
meets once every other week

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,423
for about an hour,

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,679
Thursdays at, I'm not gonna give a time,

00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,968
'cause we're all in different time zones,

00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,960
but you can find the times

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,603
in the Community Repo in Node.js,

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,740
but beyond just that Core governance

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,430
of the top level committee,

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,640
there are so many different working groups

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,190
and initiatives that you can go

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,520
and dive into, depending on what your preferences,

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,700
and like Tierney eluded to,

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,070
we iterate on governance pretty rapidly,

00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,400
which I think we should be very proud of,

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,340
especially for something of this size,

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,680
the fact that we're able to very nimbly tweak our processes

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,960
to make sure that we're working toward that gold

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,150
and most efficient way is spectacular,

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,450
but even once you get down from that top level

00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,137
of governance structure,

00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,104
which is what the CommComm meeting is about,

00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,980
about how can we clear the pipes for individual contributors

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,840
or working groups in the CommComm?

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,970
Once we get beyond that and go down

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,890
into the individual working groups and initiatives,

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,410
we get some very granular projects

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,670
that have very well scoped goals,

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,460
and Tierney, I love that OKR idea

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,250
for getting the working groups

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,630
committed to specific deliverables.

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,463
That's awesome.

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,923
Yeah, so go into that list.

00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,480
It'll probably be very helpful

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,770
for folks who are tuning in

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,831
and just learning a little bit

00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:50,420
about what we are, what we do.

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,580
Yeah, and it looked like, Tierney,

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,000
you opened it up on your end.

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,230
- Yes, I have. - So, talk to 'em.

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,435
Talk about each.

00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:57,730
- So, going down that list,

00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,660
we have internationalization,

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,763
which is championed by Ben Michel.

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,610
That project is basically focused

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,870
on providing better translations

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,530
and better systems around translating

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,673
the Node.js docs.

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,310
- Not only in the working groups,

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,690
it's not only translating content,

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,760
which is always needed.

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,010
We're using a service called.

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,070
- Crowd In.

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,350
- Crowd In, thank you,

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,420
to actually provide the translation infrastructure,

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,800
but it's also all the pipes around that.

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,450
So, how do we actually deliver those translations

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,880
to the website?

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,400
And so, we'll talk about website redesign in a moment,

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,305
but working closely with ISN

00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,773
and make sure that infrastructure actually works.

00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:47,900
So, if you're interested in that type of content,

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,050
you can go look up

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,630
when that working group meeting is

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,780
and hopefully, dive in.

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,010
- Yep.

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,500
The next one that we're working on is mentorship.

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,170
So, this is an initiative

00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:05,569
where we are trying to mentor folks

00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:07,260
to be able to contribute to Node.

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,760
So, people have signed up independently,

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,800
and then from there,

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
we've assigned the mentors.

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,520
We have a very large pool of mentees

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,040
and perhaps not enough mentors,

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,323
because the pool is so large,

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,310
but yeah, this is basically focusing

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,450
on enabling more folks to contribute to Node

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,310
and getting a little more hands-on,

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,210
rather than being thrown to the sharks

00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:36,110
and just kinda go figure it out

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,500
with the documentation that we have,

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,910
more approaching it

00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:42,650
as I'm gonna sit down with you

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,544
and I, as a generic person who is a mentor,

00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,480
not me explicitly,

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,370
but a mentor will sit down with someone

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,930
and help them

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,943
get non-trivial Core contributions in.

00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,390
- It's always a good problem to have

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,750
when you have more people chomping at the bit

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,130
to get involved

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,040
than you have mentors to make it happen.

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,081
As much as we lament about it,

00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
it's a great problem to have.

00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:11,100
- Yep.

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,400
The next one is one. - Two.

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
- Go ahead. - Projects

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,820
that would be very helpful to have more people

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,439
chomping at the bit would be user feedback,

00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,560
and related to that, enterprise user feedback;

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
although, I believe that enterprise user feedback

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,090
is far more active

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,610
than currently the user feedback is,

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,790
the purpose of those groups

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,950
are to focus on the process

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,700
of bringing infrastructure and collaborators

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,000
for more than just individual user feedback

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,748
to the project.

00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:47,370
I believe the champion for that was D-Shaw,

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,742
although, that may have changed recently.

00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,630
Maybe it might be helpful to define what champions are

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,450
for CommComm, and for our purposes,

00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,720
champions are members of CommComm

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,940
who focus on basically shepherding

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,200
and individual initiative forward,

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,150
basically wrangling people's efforts and issues

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,163
and poll requests,

00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,781
and to move that initiative forward step by step.

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,563
- Yeah.

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,510
Like most things, it's a hierarchy tiered structure,

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,780
so you have the CommComm,

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,510
which has active sitting members on it,

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,890
which focus on governance, and again,

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,920
clearing the pipes,

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,540
and then individual working groups

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,680
have a member on them who are attached to it,

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,513
like Manil said,

00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,710
ushering those initiatives through

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,893
and providing updates to the larger groups.

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,853
But yeah, the user feedback initiative,

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,180
like Manil mentioned,

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,910
very focused on collecting external feedback,

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,430
so whether that's from individual users

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,060
of different types,

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,610
post-talk back sessions

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,600
and collect feedback and give to Core,

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,767
or enterprise specific feedback questions.

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,383
- Cool.

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,160
So, some of the other initiatives, sorry,

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,900
going down the list.

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,040
Social media delegates.

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,870
This is a very new one

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,313
that Rachel and myself have been working on.

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,960
Basically, we've talked

00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,390
about it a bit publicly,

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,345
talked about it significantly publicly,

00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,320
so that's fine.

00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,153
Yeah.

00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,540
So, a to be announced program

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,670
basically focusing on enabling more folks

00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,540
to access and help out the Node.js project

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,610
in different ways.

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,410
This one specifically is focused

00:17:39,302 --> 00:17:41,949
on enabling folks, delegates,

00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,080
to help us curate

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,060
the official Node.js social avenues,

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,440
so like Twitter, and Facebook, and Linked In,

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,273
and that stuff.

00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:53,920
So, yeah.

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,710
Basically enabling folks who aren't necessarily

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,700
already a member of CommComm or TSC

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,267
or the project otherwise

00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,796
to be able to participate in that way,

00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,100
if they're interested

00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:12,520
in social media management and that sort of thing.

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,353
So, yeah.

00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,210
The next one that we have

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,723
is the Node.js Collection,

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,420
which is the medium publication we have;

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,960
although, it is a little bit agnostic

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,760
of the medium publication,

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,363
but the medium publication

00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:32,950
handled the Node.js Collection.

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,630
It's basically an avenue for us to publish community content

00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:41,560
and provide a platform for folks

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,020
who aren't Core contributors

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,740
to share their content

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,027
and their interests in Node

00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,573
and their work in Node,

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,530
their passion projects or cool things they've found

00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,930
or cool things they've built

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,280
directly on an official social media channel

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,383
in the form of a long form blog post.

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,083
So, yeah.

00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:09,900
That's the collection.

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,480
We do have a bunch of work there that's happening,

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,224
so we're, again,

00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,570
we're finding it a bit

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,200
in various ways right now.

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,380
That work is being done

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,860
in a PRNB repo,

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,183
which you can find linked

00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,230
from the Node.js Community repo,

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,280
which is at GitHub.com slash Node.js

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,283
slash community dash committee.

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,120
You can find all these also.

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,230
What's that?

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,740
- We should've led with that one, huh?

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,340
- We probably should have, yeah.

00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,890
So, you can find and get all the CommComm repos

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,610
in the Node.js GitHub board.

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,950
I think Community Committee's actually also pinned there.

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,549
So, yeah.

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:51,193
You can find all of the stuff there,

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,200
but yeah, that Node.js Collection specifically

00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:59,570
is one that's currently in progress,

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,880
and if anyone's interested in helping out with that,

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,023
we'd love that help.

00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,070
- Yeah, the kind of work involved

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,210
with the collection

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,560
is sending submitted blog posts through medium.

00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:13,060
So, you submit a request to an email alias,

00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,893
where like, "here's my long form content.

00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,530
"I would love to share it."

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,350
Go through a round of editing and vetting

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,305
from folks who have signed up

00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:21,460
to ensure that the content there

00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,764
is up to snuff

00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,170
to be broadcast out

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,053
on the official Node channel;

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,525
and then, after a round of editing and feedback,

00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,740
it gets pulled in and actually published

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,290
under the Node name with attribution to the author,

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,480
and you get to leverage the platform

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,059
that Node has built

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,240
to help get your content out there.

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,520
So, it's awesome as both a writer

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,570
and both as an editor,

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,620
if you're interested in technical content

00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:54,930
and make sure that the ecosystem

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,860
continues getting the content broadcast out.

00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,693
- Yep.

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,053
Sorry.

00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,190
Additionally, we have the Outreach initiative,

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,160
which I'm switching between Windows and Mac recently

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,713
and I can not get keyboard shortcuts right.

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,610
So, the Outreach initiative is largely focused

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,210
on helping introduce consistent workflows

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,050
around different avenues of community engagement,

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,710
specifically events, content, and contributions,

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,497
various ways to basically enable

00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,343
more folks to contribute.

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,750
So, we have a defined set of goals around this,

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,340
so a set of goals for each of those, specifically,

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,663
and then from there,

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,499
we'd love to have more folks involved in this,

00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:50,499
but that would basically mean

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,000
getting involved in helping build out

00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,490
these systems for Outreach.

00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,990
So, no necessarily, well,

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,270
possibly doing the outreach itself,

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,940
but helping build out the systems,

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,103
and then executing on those systems.

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,963
So, yeah.

00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,440
- And the hope for Outreach

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,770
is to help provide a framework,

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,330
and Tierney, actually, correct me if I'm wrong on this,

00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:18,793
it shifted in the past couple weeks,

00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:22,186
but my last understanding of it

00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,390
was Outreach was there to help

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,854
broadcast the efforts of local organizers

00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:28,430
who are looking

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,110
to make meetups happen of local Node users

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,880
and give them resources so they can succeed,

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,810
whether that's actually helping to broadcast

00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,710
the existence of their meetup and document that,

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,610
or give them resources for how to host

00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,150
a meetup or hack-a-thon,

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,600
or a mini local conference,

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,863
whatever you wanna call it,

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,870
and what best practices are to organize that

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,009
and what type of content you should have

00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,009
if you host.

00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:58,840
It's very focused around the infrastructure there.

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,710
- It sounds like the evolution of the Outreach initiative

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,240
is a good example

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,330
of how people who participate

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,770
and come on board can influence the direction

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,720
of how an initiative takes form.

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,680
So recently, we had some new contributors,

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,980
and by recently, I mean probably over the past

00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,701
half a year.

00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:23,335
(audio cuts out) joined the Outreach initiative,

00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,132
and basically took it in a direction

00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:26,584
that they though people in the community

00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:27,417
would find the most value,

00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,990
and that was, I believe,

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,643
how Adam was just describing it.

00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,063
- [Adam] Yeah.

00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,030
- Yeah, exactly.

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,920
And, they've recently expanded a bit.

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,740
In addition to the events,

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,300
they've begun discussing how they can do

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,000
the same kind of work for content

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,633
and for contributions, as well.

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,863
So, yeah.

00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:50,535
And, you know,

00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,673
very much to what Manil was saying,

00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:57,220
these were folks who reached out to a CommComm member

00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,380
and asked, "how can I get involved?"

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,300
and they are now involved,

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,690
both directly in initiatives,

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,623
and one of them is a Community Committee member, Amad.

00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,137
So, yeah.

00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,240
This initiative specifically

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,910
is a very good illustration

00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:15,883
of how, if you're interested,

00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:17,457
if you want to help contribute to the Community Committee

00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,680
and the loose community efforts

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,330
around Node.js, or you have an idea or something

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,160
that you'd like to do

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,603
to help the Node.js community or ecosystem,

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,480
and it doesn't necessarily have to be to help it grow,

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,603
but just to help it,

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,910
you're more than empowered and able to do that,

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,897
and we would love to be able to help you do that,

00:24:43,897 --> 00:24:48,470
and the Outreach is a very good example of that.

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,780
- I wanna emphasize that point.

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,719
Open source is made and run and created

00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:55,070
by those who show up.

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,240
So, if you wanna get involved,

00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,823
if you think this is exciting,

00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,030
if you think contributing to Node would be amazing,

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,620
then come in to one of the meetings.

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,119
They're all open.

00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,020
Zoom chats like this,

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,801
you just go download the client, it's free,

00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:13,801
and you can come and get engaged,

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,410
and honestly, it's just getting started.

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,243
The hardest part

00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,290
is to call into your first meeting,

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,680
but I have not met somebody in this community

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,530
I don't like yet,

00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:26,518
and I'd love to have you

00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:27,868
in any of these initiative.

00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:31,170
- [Tierney] Yep.

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,460
- I have a question in response to that.

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,293
So, if someone

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,453
were to come along and say, "hey,

00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,967
"I'd like to join the meetings,

00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,410
"but I have nothing to contribute at this point,"

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,793
how would you respond?

00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:48,190
- I would respond by saying

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,189
you're more than welcome to join,

00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:54,719
regardless of whether or not you have something

00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,530
to contribute, you're more than welcome to come

00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,550
and sit in on the meetings.

00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,090
You can talk or not.

00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,923
It's fine.

00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:01,090
Either one.

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,390
We would love to have you.

00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:06,120
One request that I will make,

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,690
we do have a weekly issue,

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,130
or sorry, bi-weekly issue

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,210
that goes up that gives all the details about the meeting,

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,162
just commenting on that and saying you're joining,

00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,920
'cause we have the two links,

00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,870
we have the livestream link and the Zoom link,

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,713
and people sometimes get confused,

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,740
like if they wanna watch,

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,842
which one they should be using.

00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:26,790
So, just commenting in the issue

00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,660
so I know to add you to the meeting.

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
I've gotta cough.

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,428
Hold on.

00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:35,860
Knowing that I can add you to the meeting

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,420
that you're interested in participating,

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,520
that would be super helpful,

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,410
and just commenting that once,

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,500
I will know from then on to add you,

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,890
or whoever is running the meeting

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,300
will know from then on to add you.

00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,450
So, yeah.

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,750
Just feel free to join.

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,470
Listen, give feedback.

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,420
You don't have to talk in the meeting,

00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,460
but we'd love your feedback on the meetings,

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,400
whether it's during or after

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,163
or offline or whatever,

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,250
and yeah, come participate and let us know

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,060
how we can help you engage and contribute.

00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,823
- If you think you don't have anything to contribute,

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,030
I may humbly propose that you are wrong.

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,060
Everybody has something to contribute to the community.

00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,820
It's a community built by its members

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,770
from the ground up.

00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,415
So, come engage if you wanna be a part of it.

00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:25,473
You're more than welcome.

00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,922
- I believe we have one last initiative.

00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,620
- Oh, hmm.

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,999
Oh. - Website redesign.

00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,785
- Quick logo check before we do website redesign.

00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:37,573
Tierney mentioned bi-weekly issues.

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,770
That issue is an issue

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,770
that's created in the community dash committee repository

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,370
in the Node.js organization.

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,030
That's an issue that we use as an anchor for meetings.

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,427
So, that will usually be your source of truth for anything

00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:57,270
that you'd like

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,210
to refer to when trying to find a meeting,

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,780
and it will have the Zoom link,

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,860
it'll have the YouTube livestream,

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,250
it'll have details about what's going to be discussed,

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,970
and it'll have comments by people

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,410
who plan to attend the meeting

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,728
about anything related to it.

00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:15,640
- And fun meta process note.

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,200
These issues are automatically created

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,020
by a script we have running

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,610
on the Node Organization in GitHub, itself,

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,320
not only for the Community Committee repo,

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,570
but for all of these initiatives,

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,170
which have data GitHub repositories.

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,993
They also have their own individual meetings.

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,540
You can find the links to the meeting calendar.

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,520
I believe it's in the CommComm Read Me,

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,423
right in the root,

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,987
and these meeting issues get generated

00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:48,260
on the Monday before the meeting happens?

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,192
- Yep. - I believe,

00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,687
and it automatically pulls in content

00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,220
tagged with GitHub labels

00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,900
for generating that meeting agenda.

00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,980
So, wonderfully automated

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,460
because we're all engineers at the end of the day.

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,280
Well, most of us are engineers at the end of the day,

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,700
and if we can automate a problem,

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,000
we'll find a way to do it.

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,763
So, it's quite the smooth system.

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,000
- Awesome.

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,700
Do y'all wanna get into website redesign?

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,543
- Let's do.

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,083
I can dive in on that.

00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,380
The website redesign is near and dear to my heart.

00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,720
It is exactly what it sounds like.

00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,270
We are redesigning the website,

00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,300
and it's actually how I got involved

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,670
in the Community Committee

00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,100
over a year and a half ago now.

00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,053
Wow.

00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:36,113
Time flies.

00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:39,286
Yeah.

00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:40,430
So, it's another great example

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,530
of a way that you can just show up

00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,581
and make the impact you want.

00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:49,581
I was at one

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,550
of the Node Plus JS Interactive meetings a long time ago.

00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,870
I thought, wow, this documentation is a little rough.

00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,810
Let's fix it.

00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,960
So, I came to meetings,

00:29:58,987 --> 00:29:59,880
and go figure,

00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,713
started helping them.

00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:04,103
Actually, the champion for the website redesign initiative.

00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,360
So again, open source is made by those who show up.

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,170
So, come and join.

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,590
But, the website redesign is exactly what it sounds like.

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,290
We are rebuilding the website from the ground up,

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,350
making it more

00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:20,800
approachable for both new engineers

00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,640
and useful for folks

00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:27,753
who are heavily experienced in Node,

00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,060
and to meet all those use cases.

00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,910
So, we have an awesome design that we're working off of.

00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,740
Thank you, Oskar Gonazales.

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,573
Shout out.

00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,170
And, we are actively rebuilding it

00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,023
in that website redesign repo.

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,300
Caveat on the repo names.

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,133
Website redesign.

00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,300
We used to be split between two.

00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,750
One was where we were building the site,

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,082
one was where we were doing admin stuff.

00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:52,020
It was confusing for the contributors.

00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,490
We have consolidated all efforts

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,870
into the Node.js dot dev repo,

00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,430
and the website redesign repo itself was archived.

00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,590
So, if you wanna get involved,

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,850
go to GitHub.com slash Node.js

00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:05,920
slash Node.js dot dev.

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,120
That's where all the fun stuff is happening.

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,453
- Awesome.

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,173
Anything else on initiatives and working groups?

00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:21,390
- [Adam] You want more, Rachel?

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,230
- One quick thing for Adam.

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,520
What are you using to rebuild the website?

00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,680
- Yep.

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,863
We are building out in Gatsby.

00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:33,020
So, giant static site.

00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,550
It is all getting all the document content

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,185
that's getting pulled from markdown files

00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:42,390
that most of them are committed to Core proper

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,200
and get built out

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,440
using Remark for more like learn page documentation

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,759
of the committee director of the repo at the moment.

00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,710
Yeah.

00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,560
So, it's an awesome place to contribute.

00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
If you love Node,

00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,610
are more of a front end engineer,

00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,060
not a lot of experience

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,200
in service IJS code,

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,477
but still want a way to dive into this community.

00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:11,193
So, we are actively looking for contributors.

00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,877
So, come get your hands dirty

00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:14,710
in the Gatsby project.

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,344
It's a lot of fun.

00:32:16,344 --> 00:32:17,540
- Awesome. - Well, if you're interested

00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,280
in internationalization, that's also a way

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,700
to get involved with the website redesign,

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,693
because I think it was mentioned before

00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,600
that internationalization is there

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,470
to enable other parts of Node.js,

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,823
consume the right content,

00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:36,457
and that's a work in progress,

00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:37,457
isn't it, Adam?

00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,455
- Yeah.

00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:39,454
Yes, it is.

00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:40,310
We're just trying to think architect ways

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,920
to get translated content

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,440
quickly and neatly into the Gatsby project

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,380
and deploy it out

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,610
in a way that's sensible and reasonable.

00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,678
Some things are changing.

00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:53,511
The internationalization pipeline

00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,730
will have to change a little bit

00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,199
from how it's been

00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:01,210
the past, how long has the old website been up?

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,043
Five years.

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,270
However long it's been,

00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,490
and we are just re-architecting

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,130
that solution right now.

00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,200
So, another awesome place to jump in

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
and help contribute.

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,374
- [Rachel] Awesome.

00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,372
- Yeah.

00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,205
Good call out, Manil.

00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,145
- So, we talked a lot about working groups and initiatives.

00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:24,650
Is there a difference between the two?

00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,634
- Mister governance, I think Tierney

00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:29,639
(laughing)

00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,118
can take that one.

00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:34,837
- So, working groups are a concept in the TSC.

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,370
They exist solely in the TSC.

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,833
In CommComm, we only have initiatives.

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,910
This was done intentionally because working groups

00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:49,770
have their own governance,

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,690
and they are self-governed.

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,690
So basically, to spin up or spin down working groups,

00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,110
they have to self-de-charter.

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,730
So, they have to basically implode themselves

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,750
into non-existence,

00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,523
which for CommComm,

00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,150
we initially thought

00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,500
just copy pasting that stuff would make sense.

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,660
For the work that we do,

00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,260
having that longterm longevity

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,720
of specific initiatives

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,640
governed by the initiatives themselves

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,980
didn't really make sense.

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,980
So, we went down the pat of just having initiatives.

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,753
So, initiatives are still a part of the CommComm.

00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:38,010
The CommComm is kind of the overseeing body

00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,120
and its goal

00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:43,193
is to never need to

00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:46,550
or directly engage with the initiatives;

00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,790
however, it will do whatever it needs to

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,110
when the initiatives asks,

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,233
or to enable success of the initiatives.

00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,900
We are basically and administrative body.

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,410
So in that context,

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,220
the initiatives are self-driving,

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,490
but having and initiative-only approach

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,640
allows us to,

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,004
I see Adam having critiques of what I'm saying,

00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,522
having an initiative-only approach

00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,440
allows us to be a little bit more dynamic

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,110
with how we approach these things.

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,760
- No critiques, just the fact

00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,450
I think it's very, very important to note

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,210
that you do not need to be a member

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,090
of the Community Committee

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,120
to partake in an initiative.

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,080
The initiatives, like Tierney said,

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,530
are self-sufficient.

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,960
Ideally, the Community Committee does not need

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,663
to know what's going on day to day in an initiative.

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,495
Community Committee is there to get rid of road blocks

00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:43,997
and get resources for people who need it,

00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:48,050
if that is required for initiatives,

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,120
but otherwise, we just get regular updates

00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,240
every other week,

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,623
and initiatives are self-governing, self-functioning.

00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,341
So, yeah.

00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,390
Something that I've seen in a lot of new contributors

00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,090
is this idea that they need to actually join

00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,750
the Community Committee in order to partake

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,723
in any initiatives.

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,810
Unless you are a governance nerd

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,460
and you want to go get into the nitty gritty

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,550
of how resource governance works

00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,400
and how a service body

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,187
can help unblock contributors,

00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:23,600
then you don't wanna be on the Community Committee.

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,590
You wanna be diving into one

00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,190
of these individual initiatives,

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,790
'cause that's where the actual work

00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:33,144
on content happens.

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,263
- Awesome.

00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,420
So, how would somebody not involved in the CommComm

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,800
propose an initiative?

00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,823
We talked a lot about how to get involved.

00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:49,010
Is it step by step

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,393
or a couple of key things that someone can do?

00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:55,621
- [Tierney] So, gen--

00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:57,070
Go ahead.

00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,693
- Just to use a recent example,

00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:02,900
a recent example of a contributor,

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,200
or a person who was, for the most part, an observer,

00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,510
I believe, in several CommComm meetings,

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,600
or several months of CommComm meetings,

00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,600
but was quite interested in a certain aspect of the work,

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,230
they eventually proposed something via an issue,

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,730
which they opened, I believe,

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,380
in the CommComm repository,

00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,130
and that has taken more and more of a life,

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,100
and eventually, I believe,

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,720
could spin off into an initiative of its own;

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,603
although, I don't believe it has yet,

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,300
but that is an example of a person

00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,550
who started off being an observer,

00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,730
not a member, of the CommComm,

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,440
an observer who attended meetings,

00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,680
asked some questions to clarify certain things,

00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,450
and eventually opened an issue,

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,735
which they then brought back to the CommComm,

00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,954
and this time said, "hey,

00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:54,427
"I have opened this issue.

00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:55,490
"Can we discuss this?"

00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,830
And, that was only the first of several times

00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,410
that they then proposed discussing that subject

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,250
at a CommComm meeting.

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,590
So, as an observer,

00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,530
they were able to open an issue,

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,403
add it to the agenda for CommComm meetings multiple times,

00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:13,730
during which CommComm members discussed it,

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,790
other participants discussed it,

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,140
and I think there are several action items now

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,793
related to that issue,

00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,043
which is now in flight.

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,520
- Yep.

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,460
Yeah.

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,378
Basically, the way to get involved

00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:35,380
with CommComm and creating an initiative

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,020
at that level

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,260
would be to go ahead and create an issue.

00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,760
That's step one.

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
In that issue,

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,840
write out a detailed explanation

00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,190
of what you're proposing,

00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,800
what you'd like to see,

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,694
what the outcomes you'd like to see are,

00:38:56,694 --> 00:39:00,803
and then how you propose we could achieve that,

00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:06,160
and what you'd like to see

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,410
in both contributors to it,

00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,490
and the results that the community or CommComm,

00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:18,312
or X Y Z target audience that you're interested in helping

00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,100
would get out of it.

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,223
So, that's the main thing,

00:39:22,223 --> 00:39:24,590
it's just documenting that well,

00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,140
and documenting that well

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,970
can be a paragraph,

00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,915
it can be 10 pages.

00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,900
The length isn't necessarily quality,

00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,840
so I do just wanna assert that,

00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,709
but yeah, making sure that you're just

00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:44,138
sharing your thoughts on why this thing would be useful

00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:48,800
and why you are passionate about it

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,400
and why you wanna see it happen.

00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,220
- And, the only thing that we really ask

00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,310
is there's a concrete mission

00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,630
and well-defined deliverable,

00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,710
which Tierney, I'm excited to see codified in OKRS

00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:03,060
so that we can actually be driving

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,013
towards some type of success metric.

00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,250
The initiative should have a goal in mind

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,483
and a way in which they think that can be achieved.

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,473
But, yeah.

00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:16,810
Open the issue, come as and observer

00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,860
to CommComm meetings,

00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,490
bring it up with some of the members

00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,804
so we can discuss it in the open session

00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:24,637
of the CommComm meeting,

00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:25,993
and it evolves from there.

00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,660
- [Rachel] Awesome.

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,970
- I think we mentioned before,

00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,423
the initiatives are pretty much self-governing.

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,450
CommComm doesn't get involved,

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,470
except only to unblock,

00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,010
and by that it means that the initiative was somehow,

00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,720
the participant and the champion in that initiative,

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,170
they were somehow unable to come

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,930
to a consensus around something,

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,830
so they then elevated that particular disagreement

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,580
or point of discussion up to the CommComm,

00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,770
at which point the CommComm probably provided

00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,760
some sort of guidance

00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,960
to also help come to consensus,

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,150
which is basically how we resolve most disagreements,

00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,120
or discussions, at all.

00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,270
One other way that I see the CommComm

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,030
probably help out or get involved

00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,850
would be if something were proposed,

00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,940
but the people who were getting involved

00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,750
didn't necessarily have the context

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,399
to move that forward.

00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:22,210
Then, people on the CommComm

00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,697
who tend to have more experience

00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,780
being involved in the Node project

00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,510
than a new participant,

00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,010
they would then add some context

00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,960
or add historical context to an initiative,

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,758
saying, "hey, maybe this had been tried out

00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,130
"in a different form sometime before,"

00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,197
or, "hey, other people

00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:44,574
"you might want to reach out to

00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:45,407
"because they would be interested,

00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:47,917
"but don't have the time to necessarily kick this off,

00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,600
"you should reach out to those folks."

00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,630
That might be one way where the CommComm

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,270
could add value,

00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,532
also depending on autonomy.

00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:59,120
- Exactly how the website redesign initiative

00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,113
got kicked off,

00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,044
as I started engaging.

00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:06,120
It had been started and shut down a couple times

00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,173
in spurts before,

00:42:12,817 --> 00:42:16,133
and at the Node.js Interactive,

00:42:18,464 --> 00:42:19,297
I met with a few members,

00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:20,992
chatted with them on the side,

00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:21,825
I think, on Twitter,

00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:23,640
found them in Slack, whatever,

00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,052
and opened up a proposal to get it started

00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,193
again in CommComm.

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,060
An existing CommComm member at the time

00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,707
was like, "yeah, that's a good idea,"

00:42:32,707 --> 00:42:34,113
and it got spun up again.

00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,030
So, there maybe prior art

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,310
to base what you're doing off of,

00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,910
it could be an entirely new and novel idea,

00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,743
but that all comes

00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:46,606
from just communicate it openly on GitHub.

00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,065
Everything that we do

00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:51,700
we try to do in the open

00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,040
so that anybody can dive in and contributor.

00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,480
So, GitHub issues are the life blood

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,530
of organizing a project

00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,794
where all the members live

00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:01,627
is the best part,

00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,560
and yeah, dive in.

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,410
- Awesome.

00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,323
Super helpful.

00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,550
So, on the CommComm Read Me,

00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,460
there are multiple levels of participation.

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,175
Can you give an overview

00:43:17,175 --> 00:43:20,160
of each level of participation?

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,960
So, you've talked about observers and members

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,700
and all that stuff,

00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,903
and the potentially,

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,070
rough estimate of time commitment,

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,400
just for folks

00:43:30,915 --> 00:43:32,910
who may want to dive in,

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,030
can have some context around what it would look like

00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,080
for their day to day?

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,160
- Yeah.

00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,203
So, just coming in and joining the meetings,

00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,693
that's an hour a week.

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,650
Well, not an hour a week.

00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,743
We have a new thing this week that we're starting,

00:43:53,101 --> 00:43:55,640
but an hour every other week

00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,130
is the time commitment for coming

00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,980
and joining the meetings

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,200
and listening in and participating in that way.

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,090
So, that's hopefully a low barrier.

00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,880
Those meetings happen every Thursday

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,140
at noon Eastern, nine AM pacific,

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,630
and then there's a time table

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,240
in that issue that we were talking about earlier.

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,650
It has a more diverse set of time zones,

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,400
other than the ones I've memorized,

00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,830
but coming and joining that

00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,270
is the lowest barrier commitment

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,423
in terms of time.

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,410
Additionally, ramping up from that,

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,310
you're starting to scale out into asynchronous communication

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,460
where you're participating in issues

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,154
and things like that,

00:44:39,154 --> 00:44:40,860
participating in initiatives,

00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,812
which is however much time you want.

00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:45,770
That can be five minutes

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,230
or that can be 20 hours a week, I guess,

00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,973
if someone can justify that.

00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,630
You can spend as much time on that

00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,393
as you're really able or willing.

00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,720
From there, membership

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,580
is a little bit more.

00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,870
So, membership is involved

00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,405
in a lot of things.

00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:08,540
So for an example,

00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,890
when we were doing the OpenJS Foundation merger,

00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,530
that was a lot of time that a lot of people spent on that.

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:19,530
That was, averaging the highs and lows,

00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,143
probably about five to 10 hours a week, I'd guess,

00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,490
over eight to 10 weeks.

00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,720
So, it was a non-trivial amount of time.

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,600
Some people spent 30 or 40,

00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,210
some people spent one or two,

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,970
but it's still a non-trivial commitment.

00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:38,993
When things come up,

00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:41,430
we do often have,

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,050
it's not consistent.

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,731
It's a fluctuation.

00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:48,440
There's times when we're doing governance work

00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,543
that has to be done,

00:45:50,954 --> 00:45:53,460
and that ends up being a little bit more

00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
of a time sink.

00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,430
There's other times where we have a little bit

00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,180
of a relaxed time frame,

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,610
I guess you could say,

00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,550
and that's maybe,

00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,950
for an average member,

00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,343
two, three hours a week.

00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,130
So, it really is a scale

00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,420
and it still is how much you can

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,170
and want to put into it,

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,941
but there is a minimum level of commitment

00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:23,763
to being a member and becoming a member.

00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,750
That is, probably like, I'd say maybe on average

00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,077
four or five hours a week,

00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:35,890
and largely, it is a little bit high.

00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,713
It's an eighth of a work week.

00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,570
So, it's worth

00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,602
putting it a little bit higher

00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,435
because there are times

00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,230
when it gets a little bit more intense.

00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,910
- There's three distinct words

00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,550
that are often thrown around

00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,100
to describe a lot of these levels of participation.

00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,820
Some with actual implications,

00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,310
like being able to commit directly

00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,713
to the project repo,

00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,063
and some that are more a little fuzzy.

00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,090
The three words often thrown around

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,550
to describe those levels

00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:14,233
are observers, contributors, and collaborators.

00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,650
So, observers are what it sounds like.

00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,410
You come, show up, you hang out in a meeting,

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,963
you get a feel for it,

00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,860
but you haven't necessarily committed any code

00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,900
or any documentation

00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:32,630
or have created something and contributed it

00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,020
to the project proper.

00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,970
You're there mostly just to see what's going on.

00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,960
A contributor is literally anybody who contributes.

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,980
So, if you have any bit of code

00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,868
that has landed in the repository,

00:47:46,868 --> 00:47:48,447
if you have any documentation,

00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:51,140
if you have anything,

00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,803
congrats, you're a contributor;

00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,990
and a collaborator is somebody

00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:00,131
who has been around for a while,

00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:01,300
they've actually started

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,763
getting known in the community and in the organization,

00:48:05,664 --> 00:48:07,760
and you are added as a member

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,170
to one of these repos,

00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,380
whether it's an initiative or a CommComm itself.

00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,750
Those are three words often thrown around

00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,360
and Tierney reminded me kindly in the chat

00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,440
that observer technically doesn't exist anymore,

00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,600
but we still often use the word.

00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,420
So, it's good to have

00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,770
a vestibule word

00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,920
from old governance,

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,720
but the classification

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,650
still has meaning in a lot of members' minds,

00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,380
so it's good to have the terminology

00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:39,700
to throw around.

00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,890
- For people coming

00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:42,872
from corporate land

00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:45,030
slash work land,

00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,460
probably it might be difficult

00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,290
for folks to understand

00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:49,810
why we give people

00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,750
or why people have roles

00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,710
that are somehow related to time commitment,

00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,153
and that's because open source is,

00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,649
how was it phrased before?

00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:03,960
It's done by people who show up.

00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,090
So, the vast majority of people aren't paid to do this,

00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:11,330
so it's whatever time commitment people can put in,

00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,210
and it's a lot to ask

00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,650
for someone to commit a certain amount of time,

00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,360
and often times, even if you do commit

00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,348
some time to it,

00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:22,825
that can drop off based on life stuff happening.

00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:27,825
So by design, the expectations are flexible.

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,600
So, the minimum amount of time commitment is flexible

00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,010
based on what's happening

00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,157
in the context of the project

00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:39,857
and what's happening in the context of peoples' lives.

00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,490
So, those are not hard requirements.

00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,600
Those are requirements that are meant to help

00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,100
the project shepherd along its initiatives,

00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,790
because another thing is,

00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,220
Node.js, it's a product,

00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,210
but it's not a product that's a business,

00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,490
so you can't have leadership dictating goals,

00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,863
then everyone jumps to it and makes it happen.

00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,610
The community creates those goals for itself

00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,708
and tries to live up to it

00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,810
based on the amount of time that the community members

00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,600
can put towards those goals,

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,600
and because that bandwidth is subject

00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,821
to so many other factors,

00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:19,730
what ends up getting done

00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,660
can be very variable,

00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,340
and the structure of the project

00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,423
is designed to account for that.

00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,130
- Something I've very much appreciated

00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,560
about the Node project

00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,050
is the lack of stigma associated

00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,060
with the ebb and flow of contribution

00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,200
that everybody has.

00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,670
It does not matter who you are,

00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,620
there's gonna be times where you can put more in,

00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,660
and there's gonna be times where you need to back off

00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,160
and focus on other priorities,

00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:51,790
and the project is happy

00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,650
and excited to take whatever you're able to contribute,

00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,074
but there's been such a good understanding

00:50:57,074 --> 00:51:00,380
from community members for when you need to back away.

00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,190
Speaking personally, early on

00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,850
I was personally able to dedicate a lot of time,

00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,770
I helped run and organize

00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,921
a lot of stuff on the Community Committee.

00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:15,380
More recently, literally the past two months,

00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,458
I've had a lot of other project work going on,

00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,400
but I had to step back,

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,080
and yet I feel

00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,230
like because of this governance

00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:26,931
and because of the accommodation

00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,862
for not only the natural ebb and flow

00:51:28,862 --> 00:51:29,867
of the project itself,

00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,063
but the ebb and flow of the digital contributors,

00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,360
it is accommodated for

00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,363
in how the actual project operates.

00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:39,320
So as a contributor,

00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,294
you are able to choose your own adventure

00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,650
for how you contribute,

00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,430
and the project will accommodate

00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:49,537
to make it happen.

00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,483
- Awesome.

00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,870
So, we've got about seven more minutes left.

00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,310
I think that's plenty of time

00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,703
to get through these last few questions.

00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,472
So, the next question is why would I participate

00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:06,327
and contribute to the CommComm?

00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,263
- Looking for community.

00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,050
(laughing)

00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,900
- There's a few things here, I think.

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,260
One, you like Node

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,090
and you want to help

00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,610
grow its community.

00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,240
I know that's part of why

00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,690
I began engaging with Node.

00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,770
Another is that this is a good avenue

00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,623
for non-technical contributions.

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,700
Just as a personal thing,

00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,920
I started contributing to Node

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,940
when IOJS forked out

00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:50,690
because of a blog post that Michael Rogers wrote

00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,801
where he said, "non-technical contribution

00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:56,193
"are (audio cuts out)"

00:52:56,193 --> 00:52:57,330
and that made me come and contribute,

00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,920
which is why I got a job in this

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,320
and a bunch of other things.

00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,393
Long story.

00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:06,670
But, this is a very good avenue

00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:10,640
for those who want to do non-technical contributions

00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:13,410
or have time to do non-technical contributions

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,510
to be able to do that,

00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:18,270
and that's something that I have consistently seen Node

00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:23,270
and IJS evolving from that to value,

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,760
and I'm happy that we've been able to codify

00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,560
a little bit more of a strict path for that

00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,633
or a broader committee for that.

00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,810
That doesn't mean that the things

00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,360
the Community Committee does aren't technical

00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,610
or aren't code,

00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,700
but there are plenty of avenues for non-technical

00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,883
and non-code contributions to occur.

00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:49,580
Additionally, I think

00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,410
that there are certain people who are interested

00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:55,640
in community and who are interested in events

00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,690
or who are interested

00:53:59,397 --> 00:54:01,330
in different aspects of technology

00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,899
that aren't necessarily just community,

00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,810
and the community in Node

00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,870
is a codification

00:54:08,669 --> 00:54:10,430
of the project's value,

00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,820
valuing that kind of work;

00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,610
and so, it's a good place for people who are like that

00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,170
to come and participate in a project

00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,920
at a higher level

00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,753
in that way.

00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:28,620
- It very much depends on your personal priorities.

00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,620
I do feel that that two prong split.

00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,420
I've seen a lot of people who are in it

00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,720
because they love Node,

00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,870
they use it day to day,

00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:43,373
both professionally and in their passion project.

00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:45,380
It's the foundation that they build on

00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,470
and they want to give back in some way.

00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,620
There's a lot of people

00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,289
who are just in love and dedicated

00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,210
to creating these open inclusive

00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,833
and productive places,

00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,497
and the Node and this project

00:54:58,497 --> 00:55:00,490
and the infrastructure that we've built

00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:03,308
and codified around how to make that happen,

00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:05,608
and how to iterate on how to make that happen.

00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,535
I see that as a great platform

00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,470
to scratch that itch, as it were,

00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,106
to help build those types of (audio cuts out)

00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:15,939
Yeah.

00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:17,610
So, if either of those resonates with you,

00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,540
then you're probably a good fit for diving in somewhere

00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,907
in the CommComm.

00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,370
- One thing to note

00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:29,370
is that with the type of interest

00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,163
work in CommComm can attract,

00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,320
it is helpful to know that it's non-zero sum

00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,970
in that if you jump in

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,029
and contribute into something that interests you,

00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:45,650
you are then able to create more opportunity

00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,540
for other people to also jump in

00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,053
and do much of the same,

00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,070
because usually, something that you try to kick off

00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,880
or something that you try to contribute to

00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,590
can then expand with your help,

00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,530
and other people will then have an opportunity

00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:07,100
to participate in the same things you're interested in,

00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,890
which is probably how community gets created.

00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,570
It's a sort of gravity.

00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,620
The more people join,

00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,590
the bigger the gravity,

00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,290
and more and more people are able to jump in, as well.

00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,250
- I really like that.

00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,310
That's awesome.

00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,693
So, in the final few minutes here,

00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:29,010
what are the areas

00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,920
where the CommComm could use more involvement,

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,730
and what are the avenues for folks to get involved?

00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,802
Which I know we've talked about a lot,

00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:38,470
but one more plug for involvement.

00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,812
That's always a good thing.

00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:42,191
(laughing)

00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,570
- So, one thing on the involvement.

00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,604
If you are interested in getting involved,

00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,054
we've provided a bunch of avenues to do it,

00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:51,400
but still aren't sure,

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,301
please, feel free to reach out to us.

00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:56,280
Any of use would be willing to (audio cuts out),

00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,868
but I have open DMs on the OpenJS Foundation, Slack,

00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:03,673
Twitter, you can reach out to me publicly,

00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,770
or I have open DMs again.

00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,400
Feel free to reach out to us

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,623
in any way that you are comfortable,

00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:13,240
and we would be more than happy,

00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,490
at least I would be,

00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,581
I don't wanna speak for Manil and Adam,

00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:18,070
but I have a strong feeling

00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,720
that they'd be okay with it, too.

00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:23,610
We're happy to help you get involved,

00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,240
however you are interested,

00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,860
and I'm happy to spend time

00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,473
helping you get involved in the ways

00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:32,923
that you're able and interested.

00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,330
- I will second that. - DMs are definitely

00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,460
a good way to reach out.

00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,160
My DMs are typically open.

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,360
They're closed for unrelated reasons right now,

00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,536
but they're typically open,

00:57:44,536 --> 00:57:46,970
and I'm definitely willing to help guide people

00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:48,860
in the right direction.

00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:53,103
Also, the Node.js Twitter handle itself

00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:57,150
tends to tweet out opportunities

00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,410
for people to jump in.

00:57:58,410 --> 00:57:59,470
So, that's very helpful

00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,100
because it watches a lot

00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,803
of contributors or community members

00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:08,327
and amplifies their voice about saying,

00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:09,307
"hey, come join us.

00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:11,590
"We're doing some work here."

00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:16,590
- I will add a third heck yes.

00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,600
My DMs are open on Twitter.

00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,433
Come message me.

00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,266
I will caveat that

00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:23,110
with I am occasionally bad at responding.

00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,410
Please, please, double tap

00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,913
with the messages.

00:58:27,913 --> 00:58:29,170
It is nothing personal.

00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,473
I want to talk to you.

00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,200
Send me a reminder if I don't get back right away,

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,030
and that goes for all of us,

00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,140
but yeah, we will be happy to help

00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,070
triage you to where your interests are best suited

00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,370
either in CommComm or elsewhere in the project,

00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,707
and also, just come show up.

00:58:46,707 --> 00:58:48,540
We listed off a bunch of working groups.

00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,920
They are listed in the main Read Me

00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,260
of the CommComm repo.

00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,429
We link out directly to the repositories,

00:58:55,429 --> 00:58:57,483
sorry, not working groups, initiatives,

00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,430
loose terminology, where those initiatives

00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,220
are actually doing their active work

00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,053
in that Read Me,

00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,660
and if you're still unsure about where to start,

00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,620
open up an issue,

00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,750
say you're excited to contribute,

00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,003
and we can help you get going there,

00:59:15,195 --> 00:59:17,470
and we'll be happy to help;

00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,904
although, try and find,

00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:21,700
do some due diligence,

00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,730
find the repo that you think you're gonna be interested

00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,593
in engaging with,

00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,874
read through the existing issues,

00:59:26,874 --> 00:59:29,360
drink from the fire hose for a second

00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,607
of content on GitHub.

00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:32,400
It comes fast,

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,540
but it's a lot

00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:38,093
of valuable pre-existing work,

00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,950
and again, it's done by the people who show up.

00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,980
So, come, make yourself known,

00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,113
and come join up.

00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,973
- Awesome.

00:59:46,973 --> 00:59:49,393
Well, we are just about out of time.

00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,560
Is there anything else

00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,060
that anybody would like to add

00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:56,263
before we close this one out?

00:59:58,886 --> 00:59:59,900
- [Tierney] I think we're good.

00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,450
- I think that said it all. - Awesome.

01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:02,569
- [Adam] We want you.

01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:03,500
Come help.

01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,342
- Thank you all so much

01:00:05,342 --> 01:00:07,350
for your time

01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,400
and your expertise in this area,

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,620
and thanks everyone who tuned in.

01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:19,190
We'll get this posted on the OpenJS Foundation blog

01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,210
and we'll get it tweeted out,

01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,110
so for folks who maybe didn't have a chance

01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,460
to catch this live,

01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,730
you'll have a chance to re-watch it, and yeah.

01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,680
So, everyone have an awesome day

01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,830
and thanks so much for joining us.

01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,973
