00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:52,289
gonna be talking about web hints today

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:54,120
oh okay we're talk about web and today

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,739
I'm going to be moderating the

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,329
discussion so I hear we have questions

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,730
we have a couple pre submitted questions

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,340
we have the ability to ask questions

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,100
live on YouTube you can tweet at open

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,830
JSF with your questions about weapon so

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,770
we're gonna get started here in a minute

00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,360
with two contributors before we we get

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,210
started I just want to just introduce

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,150
myself again my name is Rachel while I'm

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,700
a program manager for dev tools for

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,990
Microsoft edge so I've been there for

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,610
not quite a year yet but it's been

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,680
exciting of course because we just

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,470
really started chromium based browsers

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,299
so it's been really fun for me to work

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,070
in open source again to collaborate out

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,780
in the open with folks at chrome and

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,549
contributors on the chromium project and

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,600
I think that dovetails really nicely

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,150
with what we're going to be talking

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,650
about today with web hint which is all

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,930
about making the web a great place to

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,509
dev regardless of what browser you

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,020
choose so that's a little bit about me I

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,030
wanted to give a chance for our two

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,369
panelists to introduce themselves Harold

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,630
and Tony and Harold I want to start with

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,909
you because I saw you go off the mute

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,799
first okay go yeah I'm Harold the hungry

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,290
member of the project part of the

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,590
Firefox side I'm a product manager on

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,789
Firefox dev tools which includes

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,860
automation and the front end of dev

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,130
tools and a few other things so it

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,470
generally do developer experience so

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,610
big part of my job is thinking yeah to

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,880
make things better for developers so

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,290
collaborating here with weaponed and

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,480
thinking about how we extend these

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:28,130
things into dev tools it's part of my

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,980
job so and it's been a fun we're to Tony

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,810
well yeah I'm Tony Roth's I'm a software

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,330
engineer on the developer tools for

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,690
Microsoft edge I joined the project

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,470
we've got a little over two years ago

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,930
and yeah just really excited to kind of

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,610
help build tools for developers getting

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,530
to do this out in the open and getting

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,750
to collaborate not only with other

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,670
people but other projects to bring this

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,480
experience together it has probably been

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:59,630
my favorite thing so far great excellent

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,390
well before we get looking at some of

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,680
the community questions I wanted to open

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,930
with a couple of background questions

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,490
just to sort of set the scene for folks

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,270
who might not be aware of web hint or

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:15,140
what it is so first of all I'm curious

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:17,480
to know how did web cam come about and

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,760
what does it do exactly he wants to give

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,650
the elevator pitch for what WebM is so I

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,020
actually think Harold has the longest

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,010
history with the project of anyone here

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:34,940
if I recall correctly but I can totally

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,920
feel this too to start so my

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:42,230
understanding of the history of weapon

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,020
came out that there was a project I

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,970
think that had inspired trying to

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,950
originate this for some of the work that

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,330
had been done for online scanner for

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,680
Internet Explorer there's a modern ie

00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:59,990
but that was very browser centric and I

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,480
know that Anton who really helped get

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,730
the project started was interested in

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
doing something that was broader

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,930
reaching for web developers and I think

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,580
Harold in conversations with you in

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,250
particular you helped encourage him to

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,010
open that up and explore something that

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,830
could be useful for web developers

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,070
regardless of which browser or browsers

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,070
they were developing for and I think the

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,550
the key problem that was looking to be

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,580
solved with the project is

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,650
this huge amount of knowledge and that

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,150
ever increasing in web development we do

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,340
you have so many different resources and

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,020
in there's so many new standards new

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,060
developments going on in browsers you

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,370
can't hardly keep up with it all let

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,379
alone the community driven projects and

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,210
frameworks that build on top of the core

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:53,159
platform and so trying to build the best

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,740
web content that you can can be a really

00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,650
daunting task and having a project like

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,669
web hint to kind of help set the

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,220
guardrails and help keep you on the

00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:06,169
happy path I think is really the core

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,169
idea what it's about

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,680
yeah Harold did you everything you

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,599
wanted add that yeah I always like to

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,130
see it other people are trying to

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:17,990
summarize it because it's such a such a

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,400
broad reaching project where developers

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,990
especially if they touch new code but

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,030
even more so when in touch older

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,190
projects really struggle with like what

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,590
can I remove like whatever decisions

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,569
behind his code and that's where weapon

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,699
really initially talked about a lot I

00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,009
like a seed just from the web like you

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,599
can remove this this meta tag you can

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:38,969
route this because I can so much so much

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,039
of that knowledge is kind of lost in

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:44,039
nowhere where it's just you don't really

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,229
know what can be touched without like or

00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,880
why why things were headed initially so

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,719
that's the thing too big a big part of

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,520
just being helpful to developers on what

00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,259
parts of the code don't do anything

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,139
which is something Firefox dev tools has

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:01,219
are more for CSS as well which weapon

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,029
does rely C for for HTML and other parts

00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,349
certainly that's that's we do something

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,300
people people appreciate like they they

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,490
try to understand like this this massive

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,779
codebase and pointing at something like

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,979
you can move this you can move this like

00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,300
this is probably something not something

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,330
you need there's something you can

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,880
expand to support more browsers so just

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,009
like not having just this this knowledge

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,229
of what works across all browsers in

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,789
what shape in in their hat but putting

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:29,219
that into a tool makes it easier and

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,900
dinner parties that that it it's it's

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,289
set up in a way thanks to a J's

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,060
foundation that it can be expanded so it

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,740
shouldn't doesn't try to be opinionated

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,270
to say I'm telling you this is bad this

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,430
is good

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,050
is in between but it's just telling you

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,670
that these might be the things you if

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,020
you might want to consider if you want

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,430
to clean up your code and depending on

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,860
your priorities if you want to look at

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,470
security look at performance trying to

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,730
solve caching issues then those those

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,670
can really point you into the right

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,760
direction without telling you if that

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:05,980
code is needs to be like fixed now to be

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,300
according to whatever thing different

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,520
follow so that that's something where

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,430
it's very interesting where I'll be like

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,100
building out this ecosystem of other

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,150
recommendations people can add to it and

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,070
people are also putting up their own

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,140
experience like learning a thing oh I

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,310
should actually follow this direction

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,820
and then being able to spread that

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,450
within a team within a company this is a

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,730
nice platform to do this well yeah it

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,930
sounds like it's kind of taking that you

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,640
know that thing we do when we're

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,250
developing for the web we have like a

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,990
tab open on MVN and we have one open on

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,780
the wicked standards and we have one

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,850
open on like some Stack Overflow post

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,370
about how to take care of a certain

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,780
problem and all that like institutional

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,280
knowledge that we have in our heads this

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,880
is about sort of like consolidating it

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,710
into one you know between like the the

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,760
hints that weapon-- provides as well as

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,140
the configurations sort of a custom but

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,740
that custom sort of recommendation

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,660
experience and yeah it's definitely hard

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,720
to keep up with the ever-changing web

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,730
and all of the you know standards new

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,820
implementations things get deprecated it

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:15,300
happens so that's a great interest of

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:20,050
the project Thanks

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,430
so I'm kind of curious actually how I

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,070
totally touched on this little bit but

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,720
how the two of you came to be interested

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:32,140
in working on my hands what could have

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:36,610
drew you to the project you want to go

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,690
first Sarah yeah oh oh oh designate the

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:46,860
first responder so folks yeah unmuting

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:51,020
work I think two three years ago

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,120
probably I'm ton reached out I think

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,800
like chrome tough sometimes a lot of

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,410
browser people were in town in Mountain

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,600
View California so we're just kind of

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,160
meeting up with two people and Anton

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,960
reached out with somebody from the Jays

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,210
Foundation as well they just want to

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,160
kind of get to talk about like this this

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,860
project I had in mind that they want to

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,020
get into a json Dacian to be to be a

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,260
cross-browser project so everybody can

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:19,550
participate so and have this open

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,900
platform for everybody to feedback in to

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,970
the project and that that's where we

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,500
initially started so I think it took

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,640
like another half a year actually get

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,340
the project launched and like another

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,260
two years probably to it a 1.0 so it

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,510
just things like time so that does the

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,640
initial one that that my parents are

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,020
already interesting because I think it

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,750
wasn't even working yet on dev tools

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:46,340
officially that was just in my role

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:48,200
that's kind of getting a keeping tabs on

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,390
the web and see where we can collaborate

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,130
more with people creating interesting

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,580
things on a web and there was already

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:58,640
yeah really an interesting space because

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,890
that was kind of evolving where dev

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,840
tools extension system and then later on

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,550
thinking more about how these extensions

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,160
can integrate deeper within dev tools

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:12,730
that's kind of where it evolved into so

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:17,510
yeah that's my yeah Tony how about you

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:21,760
yeah I I've had a long history with the

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:24,170
web and specifically a stint working on

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,860
solving compatibility problems with

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,940
browsers in an earlier role at Microsoft

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,530
and so the the kind of goal of the

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,540
project really appealed to me because

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,240
I'd seen all the different ways that

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,610
just the most minor changes and the core

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,250
browser platform could negatively impact

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,600
web content like good intentions but

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,610
unfortunate results and some of that

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,590
came from various different ways that

00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:00,860
sites have been developed over time and

00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:02,960
the need for kind of helping show the

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,490
best practices and not just go out and

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,020
talk about them

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,930
because I think that's a lot of what it

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,580
happened before is we read hold talks

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,320
about oh yeah you should do things this

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,480
way because you know you avoid this

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,580
particular problem if something changes

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
in the future and the platform or that

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,560
makes things faster or it makes things

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,420
more secure but being able to automate

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,570
that really appeals to me because now

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,000
you're not putting the burden on

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,830
developers to go read pages and pages

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,770
and pages of documentation but you're

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,000
helping identify just the pieces they're

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,800
relevant to what they're trying to do

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,550
right now and that's what really got me

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,290
interested in the project great so

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,050
actually I want to kind of expand on a

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,600
couple points that folks made here so I

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,940
know Harold mentioned dev tools

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,920
extensions and Tony you mentioned

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,529
automation we talked a little bit about

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,810
the problems that web pencils but we

00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:00,020
haven't really talked about what exactly

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,610
it is of in terms of like the forms it

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,910
takes and in fact there are quite a few

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,670
like sort of entries in the web hint

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,380
product suite so Tony maybe you could

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,100
talk a little bit about what the weapon

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,310
offerings are yeah and to give kind of

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,290
the very quick summary of what the

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,690
project is it you can think of it

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,020
succinctly as a linter for the web if

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,880
you will but you know it's a tool about

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,440
helping you identify best practices of

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:33,110
your code Carol referenced earlier being

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,170
not too opinionated with the weapon and

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,959
I think that the way I look at that is

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,430
it's presenting opportunities for best

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,440
practices it's identifying opportunities

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,089
in your code as opposed to telling you

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,130
this is exactly how you have to do it

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:50,089
that's why it's configurable so you can

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,860
change things now to provide that and to

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,390
help make it useful when we talk about

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,150
like what offerings are actually

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,160
involved we we're trying to integrate

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,740
into an increasingly wide array of

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,480
places we've been looking at this with

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,579
the project is part of hitting different

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,050
parts of the developer lifecycle whether

00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,089
you're developed writing code and

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,980
developing whether you're debugging it

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,750
in a browser or whether you've already

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,810
deployed and you want to evaluate

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,779
something that's in production we want

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,139
to be able to provide feedback at each

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,790
in that cycle and so the products that

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,339
the offerings that weapon currently has

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,230
kind of revolve around that the now the

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,300
earliest was kind of the online scanner

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,430
that's still very useful and up there

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,709
where you can go to weapon IO you can

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,779
type in any public URL and it'll just

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:39,199
kick off a scan using weapons web

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:43,129
service and give you the results but

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,160
from that I think we moved into node and

00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,050
so there is a hint package on NPM that

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,019
you can get so that you can run it like

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,889
any other linter against a maybe a

00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:57,019
staging or local URL or even raw files

00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:00,019
on your filesystem to get feedback that

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,059
way there's an own API if you want to

00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,309
programmatically drive that but there's

00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:08,569
also the command-line interface that you

00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:11,629
can run in the past year we've branched

00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:13,339
out from that to expand into extensions

00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:15,379
into browser dev tools to really help

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,559
more with that debugging side of the

00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:22,160
life cycle and so in the fall we the

00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:25,100
project released dev tools extension for

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,509
Chrome the new chromium based edge and

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,250
Firefox so we can run the tool on any

00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:35,290
site that you can load in the browser in

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,059
any of those three browsers and then

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,680
we've just announced I think we

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,029
technically got the package out a bit

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,879
earlier but we just announced the

00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:46,129
official v1 for an extension for Visual

00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:48,529
Studio code where we're trying to

00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:50,029
integrate and much earlier in the

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,519
development cycle because we all know

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,769
that bugs are more expensive the later

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,980
you discover them to actually resolve

00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,899
and fix and so engaging while you're

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,589
writing code is sort of the optimal

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:06,800
place to find something there's other

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,720
places we're still expanding into as

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,420
well we think that being part of your

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,639
test flow to help you hold the line on

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,800
the qualities that you think are

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,319
important in your own project it's

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,999
really important so you can integrate

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,889
weapon into your CI flow we've got

00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:24,499
instructions on the website to do that

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,120
with like Travis and circle and there's

00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:27,580
an early project we're working on that's

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,650
not final yet

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,670
for integrating with Azure pipelines but

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,120
the projects up there on yeah that's

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,340
awesome

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,750
thanks yeah I'm really excited about the

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,330
BS code extension

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:43,120
I just wrote actually a blog post about

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,100
it Tony and I collaborated on that and

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,550
it's up if you follow a web hint on

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,560
Twitter webhead IO is the handle you can

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,420
find our blog post about that recent

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:58,180
announcement as well as other web hint

00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:00,220
news so small plug great so I think the

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,620
next question I was interested in asking

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,180
and I'll address this one to Harold is

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,600
that what do you think

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,000
and are the most important problems that

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,280
web hint solve and that could be like

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,060
for you personally or for the web of

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,820
community at large yeah I think to just

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,340
the general theme of building things for

00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,380
users I think that's what often like we

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,440
as tool builders but also developers

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:31,540
like have to keep in mind as the goal

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:35,320
like the end user so anything that helps

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,180
sites to work better and for more users

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,890
is this helpful

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,890
so things that often fall through cracks

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,620
I guess of course X ability so that's

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,810
like the the Louis bar and X build even

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,930
comes in a gradient of keyboard

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,820
accessibility color accessibility

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,460
readability there's a lot of things that

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,570
fall into this so that just that's

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,760
something we know we're struggle with

00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,090
like because it has so many aspects to

00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,480
it

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,250
so you can you can start small you can

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,110
end up screen readers and it's not easy

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,330
to test so any any help we can give

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,920
developers it's helpful but it all

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,750
speeds into performance like performance

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,500
itself is next ability issue for some

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,650
people especially if you traveled on 2g

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,330
so doesn't load if caching is broken

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,610
like there's so many things you can do

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:24,970
wrong and often times when you do

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,730
performance audits it's not it's not any

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,730
main thread io that's cuz roms just like

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,980
bad caching sending too much data and

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,110
that's that's that's easy to to audit

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,030
foreign it's those are really hard to

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,620
fix because our for my big architectural

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,750
problems as well versus like just

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,330
switching on a CDN

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,950
so yeah it's it's everything kind of in

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,280
support of building better user

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,020
experience this especially where fixes

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,600
or hopefully just adding some tax it's

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,820
not about like a broken product design

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,720
it's really the engineering aspects of

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,820
it which people often forget and having

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,789
the tools in place to hold up that bar

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,580
like what once you fix those things you

00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,169
don't want to regress them so having

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,659
those tools in place across your

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:12,610
development pipeline in your editor in

00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,289
your animation and your browser so

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,429
people can test it on to open in

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:20,700
production like that's that's I think

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:22,990
the biggest thing so the setting

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,049
expectations for user experience and

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,330
having a tool to hold people accountable

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,860
yeah yeah yeah actually you brought a

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,419
great point I think one thing we haven't

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,460
really talked about is like not only

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,350
does web hint like provide developers

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:39,159
with some guidance but you talked about

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,470
fixes so I hope actually Tony if you

00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:44,590
want to take this one maybe explain of

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,360
folks like what web hint provides not

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,880
just in terms of like information or

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,130
standards but in terms of like actually

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,390
helping developers be able to fix the

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,909
issues that they encounter and this

00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,470
could be sure yeah I think you know

00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,179
especially looking over the past year

00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,799
one of the key things we've focused on

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,900
with the project just trying to do a

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,020
better job of getting you back to the

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,659
line of code that's related to the inter

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,000
issue that's being reported and so and

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:12,549
that also really heavily helps enable

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,080
the vs code extension in particular but

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,230
even when you're not working against the

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,520
raw source code if you're using webhead

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,130
through the online scanner or through

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,100
the browser extension you're typically

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,799
going to get pointed to the source file

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,240
and a line and column information to

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,210
help you kind of identify where the

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,659
problem really is if it's something to

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,549
do with HTML then the browser extension

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:38,260
will help jump you to the correct

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,419
element in the elements panel so that

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,309
you can kind of explore it in case that

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,799
may have been dynamically generated you

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,929
can at least explore how it fits in to

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,020
the rest of the page and get you back to

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:52,419
that point and another thing I wanted to

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,350
just plug real quick here too is the

00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:58,130
hints themselves aren't

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,649
just part of the project like with this

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,929
we're trying hard not to reinvent the

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,759
wheel and so there's lots of other

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,039
open-source projects that weapon--

00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,620
incorporates to help provide valuable

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:14,240
feedback we're not trying to create one

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,669
repository that's the de facto standard

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,830
reference for everything we're trying to

00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,750
bring together other good projects in

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,860
the community so for accessibility in

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:27,769
particular it uses the axe core library

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:30,259
and like for security vulnerabilities it

00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:32,990
ingrates with sneak so there's a number

00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:35,809
and gosh really importantly when we talk

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,690
about like compatibility of browser

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,190
support for different features I think

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,720
uses mdns

00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:48,379
backing data from the browser compatible

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,320
so that we can have an understanding of

00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:52,070
exactly which features and which

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,049
properties are supported by different

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,429
browsers and services that feedback to

00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,330
use that you're not having to go and

00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:01,279
check em beyond yourself what you don't

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,159
wanna you don't to personally maintain

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,879
the repository of all knowledge of

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,679
development yourself that is the beauty

00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:11,509
of the community nature and what's nice

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,379
too is that when we find something new

00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:17,059
you know I can go and I don't just

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:19,220
contribute to weapon I can I've made

00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:21,950
contributions to browser competitor

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,659
where I find something that may be a bug

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,730
or just hasn't been documented yet there

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,789
and so it's a great opportunity to kind

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,559
of not only consume other projects but

00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:34,850
reach into them and help improve them as

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:37,549
well so this actually segues nicely into

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,669
a an advanced question that we have here

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:42,799
which is what makes web hint different

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:46,179
from some other tools out there like

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,179
lighthouse and axe

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,140
Harold I'm gonna yeah you on the spot

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,270
yes many many people try to come to that

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,740
your question I think and taking apart

00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,440
and making it really easy to understand

00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,970
so I think they both serve definitely

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,570
some purpose there's an auditing

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,370
function of recommendations lighthouse

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,050
has focused a lot on performance a lot

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,309
of people like open yeah mostly for

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,320
performance and it's good that I have

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,350
other audits in there as well to make

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,210
them visible so and then it has a bigger

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,970
audience now outside of the browser

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,040
we've been integrated into PageSpeed

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,040
insights and really driving these

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,130
business metrics that Google ones people

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,250
talk to my seconds so I think that's a

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:33,460
great like factor for or create a

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,280
showcase of how a tool can can expand

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,340
the audience even to to everybody talk

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,960
to minds against the same thing so

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,480
that's that's interesting think T it the

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,610
biggest piece for me is the

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,790
extensibility of weapons and how it

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,650
initially really focused heavily on

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:53,650
being across the development pipeline so

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,770
being able to hook into Thea's code to

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:59,770
audit your CSS HTML really on a code

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:02,170
level versus on this like loading a page

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,730
and the browser and seeing like it all

00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:06,580
comes together it's important as well so

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,429
you like across every state every piece

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,910
of these components to build up

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:15,309
eventually a website for the user so

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,290
that's what makes it I think the the

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:19,000
slight difference but it doesn't like I

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,890
could foresee in the future maybe like

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,080
they looks like a lighthouse might be

00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,540
mining both because they there's have

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,790
any borrowed area of what people open it

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,350
for like they want to they want to know

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,300
what they can improve in their project

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,770
but also it has been interesting for

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,950
weapon tests only mentioned like they

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:37,360
have including like web company de which

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,790
lighthouse software it doesn't show but

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,960
they have a big repertoire of thing so

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:46,750
there's definitely room for those things

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,120
but they're detter the last words for

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,600
the opinionated aspect like there's a

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,920
lot of kind of red and green within

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,530
within lighthouse like things you do

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,570
wrong so but developers like developers

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,070
like to have a prioritized bucket list

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,600
but they also just want to get a general

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,780
stand

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,460
like where where can I fix where the

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,100
low-hanging fruits we're like the bigger

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,160
architectural problems so having a full

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:16,680
list displayed I think it's also helpful

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:18,570
in many cases yeah you don't mind out

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,310
pile on to that a little bit more just

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,860
add one of the key things that weapon

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,320
doesn't do that lighthouse does is it

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,660
doesn't do a lot of metrics and in terms

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,720
of real-time measurement of your

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,210
performance the focus for weapon and

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,140
performance in particular is as I

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,500
mentioned earlier it's more about

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,880
opportunities it's finding like things

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,070
where you haven't set cache headers

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,660
correctly or looking at the total bytes

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,330
over the wire

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:49,470
and looking at how that's most likely

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:52,200
going to load over a three 3G or worse

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,570
network but doing it in a way that's I

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,760
would say deterministic so that you tend

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,760
to get consistent results when doing it

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:06,780
so I have a question I'm gonna direct

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,530
this one to you Tony what do you think

00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:13,470
is the most challenging like interesting

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:16,110
challenge in terms of working in the web

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,120
codebase and you know it's someone who's

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,340
obviously a main contributor to the

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,560
project what are what are the things

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,200
that you find like very fun or sort of

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,890
interesting or challenging about

00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,290
contributing to web him yeah I I think

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,760
the the most challenging thing is the

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,130
release process of actually getting

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,320
updates out the tour but part of that is

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,240
because the project is structured to be

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,550
very loosely coupled between components

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,920
to help make it easy for anyone to come

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,360
in and contribute to just a small piece

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,060
like you want to you have a particular

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,100
idea for a test you'd like to write to

00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,020
help give feedback to users you can come

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,190
in you can make a new hint and you can

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:58,770
focus just on a isolated NPM package for

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,290
that hint as opposed to having to worry

00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,840
about the rest of the project but for

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,820
those of us that are working on more

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,000
cross-cutting pieces that means we have

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,400
upwards of 80 packages that we actually

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,670
end up touching and when we need to go

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,280
make cross-cutting changes

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,460
we try to manage that by using a mono

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:22,580
repo with yarn so that helps at least

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,990
make it a little simpler than it would

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,810
be if they were all independent git

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,160
repos and the thule night can only

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:32,360
imagine you'd have to write to help

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,580
maintain that but yeah it's the most

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,200
challenging thing but it's also what I

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,570
think provides a lot of benefit for new

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,400
contributors contributors and that's

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,260
really the key thing we're those of us

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,880
in the project want to focus is we want

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,790
to make it as easy as possible for

00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,640
anyone to come in and contribute yeah

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,680
I'm curious and maybe you I don't know

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,850
if this was all sort of decided by the

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,670
time you joined the project but I'm

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,800
curious to know like if I never you have

00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,020
at this experience of like was that

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,660
always the way web hint worked or was

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,150
that was that build process sort of an

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,480
iterative or like you know was that

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,460
iteratively decided upon or like I'm

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,050
curious if the project tried one thing

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,440
and didn't work out and he sort of like

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:21,050
arrived at this like the mono repo way

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,390
of doing things yeah I'm not too

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,730
familiar with what was before other than

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,820
to say I know it wasn't always a mono

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,820
repo it's more of kind of an inbox

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,310
approach to hints early on and then

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,870
later as the architecture became more

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,960
abstracted those are broken out to be

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:45,290
treated just like any other package that

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:48,290
could be added to the project um cool

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:51,500
well um I think I kind of want to talk a

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,120
little bit about kind of what's new in

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,720
web hints so we talked a little bit

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,120
about this the browser extension went

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,530
out of beta into v1 I think late last

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,050
year

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:08,660
bs code extension followed soon after

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:09,920
that it's a big maybe Harold or Tony

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,130
actually either of you if you want to

00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,740
take this what were some of the

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,350
improvements that were made to web hint

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,320
for these v1 releases like what what was

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,580
the sort of maybe key features or things

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,530
that you felt like oh this is really

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,880
ready to come out of beta we're really

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,360
ready to put this in front of a lot of

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,360
users

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,730
go ahead arrow yeah I think do you what

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,760
kind of mind is a lot of how data is

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,310
presented because there's a lot of a lot

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,240
of insights throwing at you like that

00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:48,880
that can help you or it also distract

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,820
from important issues so some of the

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,370
issues I filed this year when trying it

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,740
out was just like better grouping and

00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,460
better like compartmentalizing of data

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:02,530
so that was in in the X ability parts so

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,660
having those grouped and then also in

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,300
the accountability coming to Bill is to

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,950
your heart because it's there's a spate

00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,170
of like false positives so it is a big

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,850
best guess like this property might not

00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,400
work in most browsers but it's really

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,050
hard to know all the interdependencies

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,690
between the things and this doesn't

00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,390
necessarily cause an issue when you open

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:25,360
the browser that's not working and but

00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,980
it could so it's making dose the section

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,670
was possible I think that some of work

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,370
went into that as well to reduce the

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,870
number of false positives to relook at

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,630
the whole set and I was also a weapon

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,910
really let away because this was one of

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:43,050
the first projects using ambien comfort

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:45,400
data for that purpose there was a lot of

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,710
kinda additional infrastructure had to

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,780
be laid out to to make this more useful

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,820
versus just like I'm applying these very

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,660
blunt rules against you CSS and these

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,280
are all the things that didn't work

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,860
versus like okay I'm actually looking at

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,810
your whole CSS every rule holistically

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,000
within within a set where it's being

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:05,260
applied so that's that's been where

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,970
weapon really did a lot of effort to

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:14,650
make this 1.0 useful yeah did you know

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,630
did using MDM compat data did there

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,790
actually have to be changes to MDM

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,920
compat data and the way that that like

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:23,380
any changes the API or was there any

00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,110
sort of learning from that since web

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,710
hint was like he said one of the early

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,970
consumers of that

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:33,610
so the browser competitor repo is

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,800
actually predominantly just it's a set

00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,100
of JSON so it's really more of a data

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,120
structure than having an API to query

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,710
against it and

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,940
that that was part of the infrastructure

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,760
that we built up to help consume it IP

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,650
and we have since broken that out into

00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,150
its own package that's still under

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,520
weapon so that it can be consumed

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,470
separately and we've we're having we've

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,850
had we haven't recently been discussing

00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,529
this but we have kind of an open

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,150
question of whether this might be

00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:03,010
something that would make sense to be

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:06,520
part of the browser compact a to repo

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,230
itself in the future right now I don't

00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,779
know of any other project that's chosen

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,690
to consume using this particular API

00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:16,380
other than with him but it is something

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,940
that could be interesting

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,559
specifically with getting to the browser

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,799
extension being released that was the

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,380
first place we turned on providing

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,630
feedback using the compatibility data as

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,669
well we kind of tested it out there

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:36,039
before bringing it into the other places

00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:38,740
that weapon already ran and it gave us a

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,299
good opportunity to iterate on the UX

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,279
and a lot of ways like Harold was saying

00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,679
both in terms of how we present the

00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:47,020
messages so that I mean there's a lot of

00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,210
data packed in there about browsers and

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,299
version numbers and how to present that

00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,010
in a succinct way that helps make sense

00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:58,570
to developers when you're telling them

00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:00,039
specifically not only what browsers that

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,580
they're supporting might have a problem

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:05,470
but giving suggestions on hey if you

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,299
added this vendor prefix or this

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,370
alternate property you would gain

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,549
support for these other browsers that

00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:15,370
you're trying to target so that that's a

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,750
very that was a piece that we worked on

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,110
there and then like Harold mentioned

00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,909
with accessibility we because web think

00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,480
consumes acts that have been treated as

00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:28,450
kind of one hint and we based on his

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,140
feedback broke that into number a dozen

00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,419
or so categories that are based on the

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,220
categories in the acts core project but

00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,140
to treat them as independent in so you

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,039
can focus on different areas like Aria

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,779
or keyboard accessibility or labeling

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,990
depending on what you want to focus on

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:50,380
first and plethora T was part of those

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:53,280
the v12 engine as well right it came

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,610
after the browser extension v1

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,980
for the v1 of the vs code extension and

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,840
that was are driven a lot by feedback

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,720
where we would get into discussions on

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,240
the relative importance of different

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,820
hints because out of the box on weapon

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,120
prior to that point there were him

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,740
severity x' for him but they were all by

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,170
default the same so you could customize

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,040
all messages from a hint to be an error

00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,600
or a warning if you wanted but out of

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,250
the box it was completely unaffiliated

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,820
but it made everything kind of feel

00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,160
equally important and so with the change

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,890
we went through we reviewed all of the

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,320
messages generated by weapon and kind of

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,030
assigned severity x' or mapped severity

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,800
x' where appropriate like acts

00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,080
internally already had a number of

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:44,430
severity x' and so we mapped on the

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,650
accessibility messages to those to come

00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,870
up with a more useful default set to

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,820
help developers understand the most

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,790
important things most likely to work on

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,680
first it's still configurable anyone can

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,300
still like downgrade an error to a

00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,790
warning if it's not as important for

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:05,760
your project but it makes it hopefully

00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:07,410
more useful out of the box i'll add for

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,800
the vs code extension to since we're

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,760
talking about things that are new

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,990
previously weapon had really been

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,590
focused just on the core web

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:17,669
technologies of HTML CSS and JavaScript

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,980
and then of course looking at network

00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:22,830
headers and traffic but when you talk

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,409
about helping developers while they're

00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:27,270
writing code you're not often writing

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,130
directly in one of those technologies

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,950
you're typically using a transpiled

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:35,159
language be that typescript or you've

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:37,200
got JSX if you're using react or tsx if

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,050
you're using react with typescript your

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,620
CSS could be actually less or sass and

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,620
so we implemented pre-processors for

00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,140
those for WebP in to help translate them

00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,450
in a way that hints themselves can still

00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,330
be authored predominantly to look at the

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:56,790
Dom or to look at a style structure or

00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,280
the JavaScript ast even if the original

00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,860
source is coming from a transpiled

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,570
language so it kind of helps bridge that

00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,880
gap you get more feedback in your editor

00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,710
but contributors that are

00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,930
contributing hints to the project don't

00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,380
have to think about every single one of

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,240
those transpiled languages as well yeah

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,770
that's a really cool new feature I'm

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,480
super excited about that

00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:23,490
cool cool so I want to talk a little bit

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,260
more look through my list of questions

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,260
see if there's anything I missed

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,240
we were talking about before the chat

00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,830
started whether we felt like web hints

00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,310
should start a band because of all the

00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:40,350
instruments in the background here I

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,660
don't know if anyone has any comments on

00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,090
the future of the web hint band but I'm

00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,550
excited about that yeah I think -

00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,760
definitely the branding of question is

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:54,240
strong with Dulli and really amazing

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,570
stickers so that's been always fun yeah

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,770
yeah anyone watching you or calls you

00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:03,210
know it yeah it writes itself really

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,770
yeah if you ever see any of us at

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,890
conferences or me in particular always

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:10,650
travel with Nelly sticker stickers so

00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:13,770
our webhead mascot is a narwhal name is

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,810
Nelly and we have quite a few cute

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:19,680
stickers of Maui hanging out with

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:22,650
computers and web tracking but now we're

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,540
out the blog post for Mozilla hacks to

00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,730
talk about what paid extension into 1.0

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:31,410
release I included like a big version

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,550
off the Firefox sticker for my pin

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:38,810
noting that that's what I got most

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:44,310
comments on not the article so important

00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:46,890
so I'm curious to know and I'll ask us

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,280
to both of us start with Toni what you

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,540
see kind of in the future for WebP in

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,480
parts of the project you'd like to

00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,610
develop more new features things like

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,100
that you don't have to look too far into

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:02,720
the future but just some things you're

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,340
excited about up and coming with weapons

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,100
so we were talking about healthy

00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,680
developers actually fix code and so one

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,240
of the areas that we've been kind of

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,340
laying the groundwork for and better

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,700
understanding where an issue originates

00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,320
from is getting closer to considering

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,120
Auto fixing things more

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,300
like you would get with something like a

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,190
tool like esslyn obviously it's a bit

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,380
more complex for the types of issues

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,800
that we're trying to tackle because we

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,170
don't always have a great understanding

00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,420
of exactly where things come from so the

00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,670
closer we get to that the closer we can

00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,930
move to bringing that together

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,630
especially when you're talking about

00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,490
running in the editor like vs code I

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,040
think there's also opportunities for us

00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,510
to collaborate between you know the

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,400
editing environment and when you're

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,450
running one of their extensions

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,070
elsewhere to try to bring that together

00:37:53,450 --> 00:38:00,150
but to me it's you're trying to save

00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:03,420
developers time and that's time spent

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,670
reading it's also time spent editing you

00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,790
know if we can help make that more of an

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:13,410
automatic process it's great yeah Harold

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,130
I was insurance did you have any any

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,130
thoughts on that as well

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,480
upcoming features you're excited about

00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,440
or things they're hoping to dive into in

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,580
the codebase

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,140
I think yet um I'm definitely just

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,690
something I've been exploring for a bit

00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,450
it's how can this be part of a default

00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:35,850
experience within dev tools so looking

00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,890
at like run experiments to read out this

00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,600
into a Firefox dev tools because that

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,270
people have to definitely ask and asking

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,750
for an audit tooling but also we have

00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,420
had a lot of good feedback on any in

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,740
context auditing that we've been doing

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,360
for CSS that hasn't been applied and the

00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,090
Flex partisan grid has been really

00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,620
helping people to make the right calls

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,920
and why things aren't working order to

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,000
get them work better so it's a it's a

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,010
real good learning tool it should be

00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,450
exposed more in dev tools so one part

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,360
it's like getting the panel just into

00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:11,610
dev tools for all users they don't have

00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,500
to discover it don't have to find it

00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,440
somewhere else and then the other piece

00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,960
like also providing more extension hooks

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,840
into dev tools that get it into the

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,510
right place like you want to see the CSS

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,390
and HTML audits within your inspector

00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:30,720
tab you want to get the JavaScript lated

00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,880
audits into the debugger tab and then

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,310
the network tab so they need to be able

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
do not just link to those tabs if any

00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,700
information pops up so that so that's

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,810
where needs don't need to improve things

00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,630
and so that's that's yeah that's my my

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,030
focus right now for weapons just to get

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,820
more eyes on it as well yeah yeah

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:53,640
absolutely so we do have a question from

00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,530
chat and this question is have you

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,560
considered the impact of code school

00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,970
students using this tool is this

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,890
something that has been considered in

00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,890
terms of weapon as a teaching tool

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,650
now honestly I don't think it's

00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,010
something we've explicitly discussed

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,840
before but it's a really good suggestion

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:16,450
because we're we're clearly trying to

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,340
reach out to developers that don't

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:22,090
already have all this knowledge baked

00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,100
into their head and so it's got me

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,110
thinking just right now about what what

00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,340
are specific things we could potentially

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:33,100
do to help improve our reach to that

00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,640
audience and help them feel like they

00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:38,290
can engage with the project one thing I

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,140
will mention that we we've done before

00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,650
is we we actually have collaborated with

00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,090
some code school students in using

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,760
webcam as an opportunity for them to

00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:51,130
start contributing to open source we did

00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,230
that over the past summer and it was a

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,060
really great experience we had a few

00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,210
different folks come through and

00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,770
contribute hints and improvements and

00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,160
fixes throughout different parts of the

00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:05,380
project and so in addition to the actual

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,220
knowledge base that weapon-- provides I

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,360
think being something that we could

00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,520
probably put a little more thought into

00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,650
how we can make that available as a

00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,660
teaching tool contributing to the

00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:20,920
project itself I think is also a great

00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,210
learning experience and yeah I mean it's

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,890
a great point I feel like every time I

00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:25,930
use web hint I'm learning something

00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,780
right lay because I don't have all the

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:31,180
knowledge in my head but yeah if you for

00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,160
the person who asked that question if

00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,810
you have any other ideas or thoughts

00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,760
about this feel free to reach out on the

00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:40,900
web hint I Oh Twitter account or find us

00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,720
contact info on the website things like

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,970
that I be super interested to hear your

00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,850
more thoughts on that so thanks for

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:53,770
thanks for the question

00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:56,650
so actually kind of to springboard off

00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:59,580
of this topic I was curious to hear from

00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:02,890
folks and I'll start with you Harold how

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:05,230
people who are new to web hint can get

00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:08,950
started whether that's like contributing

00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,270
sort of familiarizing the code base what

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,530
do you sort of recommend for someone who

00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:15,820
might be interested in getting started

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,200
using web hint but also potentially

00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,319
contributing to a pin

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,450
yeah I think the mono repo helps to

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,609
discover all the good first books it's

00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,470
like it's that's often like that's the

00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:28,119
problem we have and other projects

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:30,640
within Firefox like we are spread out

00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,740
across github and most have Central

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,980
mercurial there's a lot of places to

00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:38,289
find good first books so but having it

00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,390
all one rebuilt it finds the right like

00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,130
server side front and whatever people

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,990
interested in I think a great place to

00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,690
start toward versus did the rules

00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:49,089
section just if you have ideas and how I

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,769
think can be more useful for you if you

00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:52,960
found something that that weapon should

00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:55,089
warn you about that could tell you about

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,670
like hey if you use this be aware about

00:42:55,089 --> 00:43:00,400
there might be dragons like just these

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,049
kind of rules then that's that's the

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,240
best way to start probably because that

00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:05,500
dose directly will help developers like

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,750
just get something in front of people

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,970
the day that you care about that help

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:14,589
you that can help others as well so it's

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:17,829
an easy way to share anything to add

00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:19,390
there yeah like don't be shy that's

00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:21,609
that's the biggest thing we're really

00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:24,009
eager and happy to help like if you have

00:43:21,609 --> 00:43:26,559
an idea but you don't have a clue how to

00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:28,829
actually make a rule for it like feel

00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,420
free to submit it on github and

00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:34,240
hopefully we can help you with ideas on

00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:38,920
how to build it and get you started that

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:42,730
way because it like I said we try to

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,789
keep the process as optimized for new

00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,440
contributors and so the other great

00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,180
thing is if you find anything that's not

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,890
clear we're always welcoming

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,470
improvements to documentation - you

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:57,579
don't have to start big you can um start

00:43:53,470 --> 00:44:00,609
small yep and I believe on the github

00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:02,529
repo there's also tags for like good

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:05,039
first issue and things like that so if

00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:07,839
folks want to browse through existing

00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:11,250
issues and look for those tags that

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:14,890
could be a good place to start as well

00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,630
yeah Thrall in there too is I think when

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,579
we talk about new hints in particular

00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:22,299
you know there's probably a backlog of

00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:24,990
ideas there some easier some harder but

00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:27,730
also we've I mean I think just scouring

00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:29,140
like Twitter and stuff we've had good

00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,580
ideas come in that we'll see people

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,180
tweet about it will

00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,560
turn around and try to get logged where

00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:39,970
often it starts with I just spent three

00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:42,700
hours figuring out that it says one line

00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:44,710
of code that's giving me grief mm-hmm

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,200
we've got some interesting hints in

00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,990
particular in the pitfalls category that

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,820
kind of originated there one of my

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:59,200
favorites is a hint about creating SVG

00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:02,140
elements dynamically so SVG's a little

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,060
bit special in the web space and you

00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,740
know we're used to using the dom calling

00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,350
create element to get all our of our

00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,320
buttons and divs and everything we need

00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,850
but if you try to create element circle

00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,270
it's not going to render a circle it

00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:18,160
gives you technically an HTML element

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,380
named circle you have to use this

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,410
alternate API called create element and

00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,270
s that you almost never touch unless

00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:28,330
you're trying to dynamically create SVG

00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:29,740
elements and so that's interesting and

00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:33,400
the problem there's there's no error it

00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,870
doesn't fail it just doesn't work and so

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,390
you can lose a lot of time kind of

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,800
digging through before you figure out

00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,570
what's going on and I think that's a

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,970
really cool category of things like if

00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:45,970
you've ever experienced that class of

00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,980
problem where it seems simple once you

00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,960
have the extra knowledge that you were

00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:54,550
missing that knowledge is something

00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:56,380
that's great to try to automate yeah so

00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:00,780
I see another question here about the

00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:02,800
link to the repo so if you go to github

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:05,160
slash web hint

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,770
there's github.com slash web hints io

00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:12,190
and then the hint repo so github.com

00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:13,630
slash web 10 io flash hint that is the

00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,360
mono repo that we've been talking about

00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,830
you'll see that web hint io organization

00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,750
has a couple other repos that are

00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:23,080
outside of that like for the web site

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,730
and things like that but the main repo

00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,700
that we've been talking about is the

00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,950
hint repo inside of web hint io so

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:33,400
please feel free to go check that out

00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:36,610
take a look at issues raise your own

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:41,570
crawl through the dock would be

00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:44,840
absolutely happy to get feedback well

00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:48,200
um I actually feel like I am just about

00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:51,170
out of questions from chat and presubmit

00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,300
and some of my own just questions I

00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,040
wanted to ask the team does anything

00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,780
anyone else have anything they want to

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,640
share or anything we didn't touch on

00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,780
that you want folks to know about

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,450
Lebanon you know I think it's

00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,040
interesting I think racially you and I

00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,040
had discussed this before kind of our

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,640
own workflows for using weapon and

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,830
eating our own dog food if you will I'd

00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,830
love to share that both within the

00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,290
project and in my own personal usage um

00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:23,000
within the project we have it set up to

00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,270
automatically run as part of our CI

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,910
process for both our website and the UI

00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:30,530
for the browser extension so basically

00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:34,580
where we're generating any visual web

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:37,670
content and we're using I think the CLI

00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,950
for the website and then hooked into the

00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,540
node API for testing the browser

00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:44,810
extension so it's an interesting way to

00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,710
kind of eat our own dog food on that

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,490
front

00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,050
for my personal usage I really enjoyed

00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,400
the vs code extension because I like

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,340
catching the issues as early as possible

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,980
so I've just it's the easiest one to

00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,660
just have on and I don't have to think

00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,100
about it I just every now and then I get

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,760
a squiggly and I'm like oh yeah I wasn't

00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,090
thinking about that

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,770
so I should go and fix it yeah yeah I

00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,110
agree I love it like the vs code

00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:11,000
extension it's great so if you for folks

00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,800
who haven't used it you get this sort of

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,050
like red squiggly underlines when you

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,380
mouse over an issue you get that sort of

00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:19,760
like intellisense dish box that lets you

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,550
know what's wrong there's also like

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,980
envious code the problems pane will

00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,420
actually list out just like any sort of

00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,070
winter you might be familiar with the

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,110
way that it integrates with this code

00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,940
you can get a list of your problems you

00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:36,740
could just like one by one check them

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,240
off so satisfying yeah absolutely

00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,220
Carol did you have anything else that

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,530
you wanted to add that we didn't get a

00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,960
chance to talk about in the question

00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:48,140
yeah I think it's it's interesting to

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,050
see like how browsers build up Indian

00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,550
company de so becomes more powerful like

00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:54,880
right now it's

00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:57,349
I think it's really complete for CSS

00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,980
there's more it has to come happen for

00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:03,380
JavaScript and HTML so how that will

00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,140
then carry over and like feed into more

00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,670
aspects of code will be interesting to

00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,250
see especially if there's more detail

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,810
and then Emily and also taking on more

00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,940
of that that knowledge had already

00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:16,040
weapon created and how this data can be

00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:20,510
used for audits so other tools can hook

00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:24,619
into it like weapon is taking a lot of

00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,480
knowledge in from X and from snag so

00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:29,560
it's it it's really great to have this

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,849
ecosystem created around this

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,070
intelligent data that will just be able

00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:35,359
to apply in different tools that's I

00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,720
think yeah that's that's that's what I

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:41,450
like to see especially as it came up so

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,080
strong in the amnion survey there was a

00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:47,930
developer's satisfaction survey that ran

00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:52,520
a lot of people were involved it's run

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:54,020
through da and the N governance model so

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,750
I have to involve Google Microsoft

00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,700
Mozilla Samsung w3c so a lot of people

00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,619
had input on what we should ask

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,990
developers about and big part it's like

00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:04,250
how satisfied are you with development

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,010
on the web and what are the biggest pain

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:10,040
points and four out of the five pain

00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,839
points were about web bility and

00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,080
cross-browser testing so people really

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,730
want to like it's a pimper imagine is

00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,830
just switching between browsers is hard

00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:21,410
so and knowing what to look for so

00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:24,200
weapon being able to like be in more

00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,760
browsers and being able to tell you in

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,400
one browser what might not work in

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,680
another browser is really changing the

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,010
paradigm of dev tools which was already

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:36,080
very kinda this one browser this one

00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,690
version oriented versus it can kind of

00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,190
funny break out of the box and be I can

00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,930
tell you like this will not work in

00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:44,990
Safari and this might nerve work and so

00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:47,930
people can open intently the right

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,980
browser and look for it and then check

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,130
yes it's actually working

00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:55,339
so that's just kind of cool yep

00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:58,430
absolutely cool well I think that pretty

00:50:55,339 --> 00:51:02,300
much does it for our AMA we're almost

00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:04,339
right at an hour so I wanted to thank

00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,440
our panelists Harold and Tony for

00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:07,819
joining us and

00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,390
definitely encourage folks who are

00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:15,829
watching to check out web hentai oh so

00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:18,589
the website is web hint dot io and the

00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:20,869
github repo is web hint io we're on

00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:23,270
twitter at weapon io just search for web

00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:27,680
hand io you'll probably find us we'd

00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:29,630
love to have more foot more folks try

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,920
out the project let us know if there are

00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:35,770
new features that you want to see love

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,849
to have new contributors as well so

00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:40,099
thanks so much for joining us

00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:43,359
