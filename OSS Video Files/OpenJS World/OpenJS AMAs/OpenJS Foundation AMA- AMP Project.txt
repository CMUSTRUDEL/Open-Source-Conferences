project

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,439
and on an a website hosting platform

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,880

at axios um we launched a

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
basically an all amp site in february

the reason i'm in the steering committee

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,480
is because

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,760
like my team has implemented the being

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,519
amp cache

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
so we have brought am to the microsoft

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,720

lead at google uh

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,840
focusing on amp and i've been with the

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
tsc since we got that started

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,280
back in 2018 with the project since we

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
started it back in 2015.

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
right that's everyone that's here today

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
um just to get folks

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
uh started since you know this is still

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
part of we had amp fest yesterday

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
i was just curious what was the one

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
topic you were excited to learn about or

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,919
just

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
have our uh audience learn about going

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
into amp fest and what's the one thing

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
you actually learned at amfast

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,919
and if you learn nothing that is also

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:11,280
good because that's working as intended

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,479
i'll pick on

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,479
i'll pick on chris

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,000
amp fest yesterday i actually didn't

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,039
make any of the talks yesterday but um

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
i'm excited about uh let's see what am i

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
most excited about amp in the direction

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,919
of amp um

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
i think generally one of the really cool

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,000
things about amp is uh

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
how a lot of the technology that started

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,199
is amp only is really making it into the

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,000
web ecosystem

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,280
and so we're particularly excited about

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,600
science exchanges and how that might

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,759
help us improve page load experience

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
and even though it doesn't get a lot of

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,440
press with amp it's

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
more part of the chrome ecosystem these

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
days

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,280
i i feel like it's really important to

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,880
the amp story so

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
i'm i'm pretty excited about that

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,919
yeah broadband question is there

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,919
anything else that the amp project has

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,880
accomplished in 2020 that folks here are

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,080
really proud of

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,080
or really excited by

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
david um i'm really excited about the

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,759
work on pixi

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
um because i've often seen one of the

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,639
biggest strengths

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,919
of amp is that it provides a brightly

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,960
lit path toward

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,720
providing good performance while

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
taking into account a lot of competing

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
considerations

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,479
and i feel like pixie just puts stadium

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
lighting on the path

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,319
um in the sense that um it provides

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
all the more ability to winnow down onto

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
the issues that are actually affecting a

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
site

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,000
um and actually get to the heart of

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
delivering not just pages that are amp

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
compliant

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
for delivery that are often going to

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
deliver great performance

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
but even optimizing forward from that

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,759
point

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,120
yeah um as someone who worked on it

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,520
we're incredibly excited

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
um about the fact that you know this

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
pushes

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,639
um the amp promise for page experience

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,479
even further it's like we promise you

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,199
that yes in a very large amount of cases

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
you'll be

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,000
you'll be set you don't have to do

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
anything just as long as you're on the

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
amp path

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
but in the few cases where you need to

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
like go implement web development

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
best practices where the amp specific

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
actions you can take there we're really

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,560
excited by that

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
and the fact that you know you have this

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
exit where if you really don't

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,800
understand what's going on or you really

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
can't understand why your page isn't

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
performing well you have that route back

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,639
to

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
um the amp project or like the

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
performance working group um so yeah if

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,440
folks want to use that that's it

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,680
uh self plug app.dev slash page dash

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
experience you should absolutely go test

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
your amp page today

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,919
and let us know if you have any feedback

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
anything else that folks want to talk

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
about um

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
about something they're proud of that

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
the project achieved in 2020

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,479
i wanted to uh bring up also red vitals

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,000
we were

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,879
working quite a bit on them this year

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,680
and it's a very exciting direction

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,240
it feels like amp is has done a lot of

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
work

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
in this area and we also are going to

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,280
have

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
a lot about uh

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
we also have a lot a lot to do uh next

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,520
year to to make sure that uh

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,959
the experience on the web just uh raises

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,519
to a new bar

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,519
to new height

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880
so this is kind of a new thing and it's

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
also like a bit of what

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,320
you learn by attending i guess virtually

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
an event like amp

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
fest um for me which is like getting to

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,560
see the usage

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
of amp by different people so you know

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,080
whether it's like some of the work

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,120
um you know in in the wordpress space or

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
um things like camp for email usage like

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,600
these these are things that i don't

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,120
often get to see

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
each day especially things like email

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
where you like you literally kind of

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
have to be something email to

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
kind of get the experience you can't

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
just like go to a link

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
so um so i think that's what's cool

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,080
about things like amp fest is getting to

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,399
kind of shine a light on some of the

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
use cases and adoption that we're seeing

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,160
amongst

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
people um to help like you know make

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,880
that

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,320
use case of email better so that would

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
that would kind of be a bright spot for

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
me

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
the other thing that i think's advanced

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,200
a lot over the past year has been

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
um stories so i'm you know maybe we'll

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
talk more about stories here in the

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,200
session too but

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
um that's another call i'd have is i

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,959
think uh

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,480
stories is like a super cool product and

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
it's it's great to see the

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,200
strides that that's been taking over

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
over the course of 2020.

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,880
um i'll

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
i'll queue up a question from youtube uh

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,680
ishaan on and asked

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,279
one of the biggest concerns about amp is

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,959
that it was a google project

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,040
um but they're excited to see that you

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,600
know uh bing also support and in that

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
way

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
um can the tsc give an update on what

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
other popular

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
platforms actually support amp

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,040
especially with privacy preserving

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
pre-rendering

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,839
i'll take this one i think that

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
microsoft and google are the only one

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
that are doing

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,160
pre-rendering um although the same

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,600
technology is basically what enabled and

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
for email

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,279
but so from uh um there are obviously

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,800
other platforms that

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,640
like to amp document you know i think

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,079
the one i personally use the most

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,120
is twitter um there's

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,800
um you know pinterest linkedin etc so um

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
so there's i think it's a pretty broad

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,920
base actually and i think the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
um it's definitely interesting to see

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
how how that

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
mechanism that kind of was was designed

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
to

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
you know be privacy preserving and that

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,360
it like tightly controlled

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
where requests are being made and when

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
uh would eventually

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,800
you know you enable use cases like and

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
for email where where like user

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
expectations are very different

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,360
um compared to the web and we were able

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
to kind of fit

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
um kind of the web programming model

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,839
into something that that matches users

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,839
expectation and emails

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
and then to that end like since we

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,079
brought up email uh

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
we know that uh folks at yahoo just

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,399
launched their developer preview as well

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,079
uh for amp for email and we're excited

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
that more like esps and more

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,760
uh senders are also supporting it we had

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
uh we had to talk at amp fest about some

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
senders we're seeing success with amp

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
for email

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
and we also announced that salesforce

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,200
marketing cloud would be launching

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,480
support

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,480
i believe in q1 of 2021 so we're seeing

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,760
adoption for different formats um

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,040
also in a bunch of places

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,440
since rudy brought up stories um

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
i'll jump off of that and ask what do

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
you think is the most critical piece

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
that the amp project can contribute to

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,320
actually see things like web story c

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
like amazing scale

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,200
i can i can try to take this one um

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
so as i've been super impressed with

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,560
stories since since the beginning

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,720
um i've like i've expressed even

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,480
internally and microsoft like a lot of

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,079
interest for using the platform

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,079
and i'm super happy that actually google

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,920
started pushing more stories and

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
actually has a dedicated experience to

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
stories

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,839
and that makes it easier for any

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
developer like any company to go ahead

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,680
and

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
create a an experience based on stories

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
right

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,040
and that's super super really because

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,040
it's so complex

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,079
to interaction models all the features

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,880
and that's all given by amp to

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,639
to to the developer to to just use it so

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,959
it simplifies the developer cycle and

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,639
if if you are a smaller developer like a

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,639
smaller company that wants to

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
leverage that you don't need to create

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,560
all your infrastructure

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
to do that it's all given to you so it

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,440
scales

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
much much better and it brings the

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
richness that uh

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,959
it's super rare to see and anywhere else

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
and in any component or any framework so

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,120
i

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,680
i'm i'm a big big big fan of stories i

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,800
really like it

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
one thing i'd like to add is you know

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
it's

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
just specifically talked about like what

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
amp can do and i think it has a little

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
bit of a different role compared to the

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,560
website space

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
and that the the main customer of of

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
of amp in the web story space is

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,399
actually the makers of the tools

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
um and and the powerful thing is that

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,760
there are these like no

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,199
code specific tools that allow people to

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,920
to make these stories

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,399
and so i think the the main job actually

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,959
of amp

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,760
is to just make sure that the the format

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,959
is a good

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
kind of target for for for these tools

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
so that they can do a good

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
job but it's a bit of an indirect

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,000
relationship but i think it's still very

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
powerful

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
one thing i will add though that i think

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
super cool is um

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
the story player that is being built out

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
for stories so

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
um you know i think when stories first

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
launched it was basically like okay this

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,120
is a web page

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,120
and it like it renders in a certain way

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,680
it has certain sort of navigational

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,800
um like behaviors to how it works

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,079
interaction models

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
um but it was kind of just like a

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,160
standalone thing and like you

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
you know uh what i think is cool about

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
the web player or the story player

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
project is that we can

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,399
um like have a better way for

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
sites to think about sort of integrating

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
uh stories to be displayed

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
as part of like their core flows um and

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,600
so i think that that's

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,959
like gonna be something that helps like

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
make the mental model

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,760
uh sort of click more for for people and

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,519
it will hopefully like enable

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,839
um you know better experiences

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,320
especially just directly on the

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,760
the origin of the site um to be able to

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,639
kind of facilitate navigation and

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,720
provide like

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
you know um you know more layers of

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,120
customization and be able to

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,080
like handle um presentation of stories

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,529
on websites

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,529
[Music]

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
anything else that folks want to mention

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,639
on the stories fun

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,680
otherwise i'll flip to email because i'm

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
curious about this

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,079
so uh what's one use case that folks

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
actually want to see an amp for email

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,199
for

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,440
like what one problem would you like and

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,680
for email to solve for you

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
be productivity be it you know getting

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,040
food delivery or

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,759
really anything in the consumer or

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
enterprise based

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,199
i have one so i mean i've been i've been

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,720
um where where for me like just

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,839
personally it has been really powerful

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,240
is when when it

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
when it shortcuts workflows it's really

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
in the enterprise space so i get a lot

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
of

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040
um you know common notifications from

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,199
google doc and being able to like

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
um see more context in line see the

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,800
latest comment in line instead of just

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,160
the email in reverse order

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,560
has just been really powerful and then

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,320
not having to kind of jump back into the

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
relatively slow loading document

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,079
actually to the reply it was

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,560
powerful and um i think recently

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,759
they've they've looked also into into

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,680
like um

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,600
approving of of of um

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,199
uh permission requests right which is

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,040
another thing where you can just kind of

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,720
shortcut that process

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
and and so since you're asking what i

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
would like to see um

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,800
like just again like me personally like

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,079
i get a lot of github notifications

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
and if i could you know and i like to

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,399
use email for them because

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,199
for me my you know i live in my inbox as

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,680
opposed to like the

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,720
the you know github inbox for

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,079
notifications

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,199
is you know i mean there's other people

00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
who like that but like that's not what i

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,079
do and so i

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,759
if i could do more things in my in my

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,640
email so for example if i

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,039
have a code review and i get like the um

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,000
you know

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,280
done done done done reply and i trust

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
the person i would like to be able to

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,360
say like approve

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,439
right and then be done and and and um

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,439
and don't have to jump back into github

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,679
click like 15 buttons and and do the

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,679
work

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,839
as a as a publisher i think one of the

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,919
things that like i'm personally very

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,799
excited about is um axios has a really

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
large email

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,679
newsletter business it seems a little

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
uh outdated but it turns out that's

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,840
actually kind of a great way to get your

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
news

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
the problem is that when we send out an

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
email we have no idea if you live on the

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,200
east coast of the west coast

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,200
and so if we send an email at you know 5

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,799
30 a.m east coast time

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
and by the time you're actually reading

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,960
that on the west coast it may be six

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
or seven hours out of date um and so i

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
think that that's actually a really

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,240
nice way to start to think about how you

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
can pull dynamic content into like what

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,720
previously has been a very static

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
platform and and kind of make yourself a

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
little uh

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,640
time zone agnostic

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,559
oh 100

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,720
uh for me uh you know once uh

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
19 is over i would like to be able to

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,960
make decisions on

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,840
what restaurant me my friends go to and

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
what exact time

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
yeah it seems like a good fit for

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
anything that's transactional

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,799
um the the cynic in me says unsubscribe

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,520
would be a good use case but uh

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,360
anything that's uh kind of a clear

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,160
action that you can take um

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,760
you know extending specific discrete

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
actions from a product experience into

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,760
email seems like a great use case

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,280
i'm hoping it means i get to unsubscribe

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
a lot less in the sense that

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
um we can you can basically send

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
something that's almost like an

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,600
evergreen email that like here's the

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
email that represents the state of your

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,480
order um

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,559
and be able to provide different

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
interactions and capabilities in it and

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,600
in ways where

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
um i don't necessarily have to get a

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,440
pile of transactional emails for each

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,480
interaction with the site

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,520
yeah well i'm making unsubscribe easier

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,440
keep senders on us i think

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
we see that in our email program

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,919
right one other question was

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
uh right so the new york times along

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
with some other publishers released a

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
proposal uh

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,320
for content aggregation technologies and

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,200
like a framework how to think them

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,400
through

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,799
um does the trc have any opinions here

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,080
um or thoughts for folks who've like

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,559
actually had the chance to like consume

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,320
it so far

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
i'll do a first answer and then maybe

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
other stuff have more to say

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,600
first of all i think it's really

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,200
important to say that there's no the tsc

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,120
as an entity does not have an opinion

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,440
about this because this came out on

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,480
monday and our next regular meeting

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
is next wednesday and we um you know i'm

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
not sure it's on the agenda there but

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,559
like we certainly haven't discussed it

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
right and most of us probably haven't

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,640
read it um i

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,520
i mean i personally also have only only

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
skimmed it

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,360
um i think my main reaction is first of

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
all i have to say

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,840
um i've tweeted this five years ago that

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,200
the original name of

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,960
of amp was cat for

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,720
content authoring toolkit and

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,520
we were not allowed to to use it

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,240
because our lawyers were afraid of

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,240
getting sued by caterpillar

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,919
and i'm just very very disappointed

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,640
because you know the internet is made of

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,360
cats and it would

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,280
have been a really good name um so so

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,000
i'm i'm very excited about the name

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,159
they they found a better backroom than

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,600
content authoring toolkit um

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,159
and it's it's great so that's that's

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,799
good and and and so the the second part

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
to my reply um you know a little bit

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,559
more

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,000
in depth is that i i like um so i

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,000
i think this is generally a good idea

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,760
right like um i i'm

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,679
i'm i'm excited the new york times

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
working on this um

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,960
i like i mean they haven't reached out

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
to us so um

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
that would be good to have a

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,120
conversation um i i certainly disagree

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
with

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,080
some of the representations that are

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,120
being made in the document but you know

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,320
i think that's fine and

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,440
and you can people can iterate on it um

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,799
i think it's you know especially since

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
it's concretely names like

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,080
different technologies like apple news

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,440
and facebook and articles

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,720
um you know i think amp is different

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,080
it has a tc right that isn't just like

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,400
one proprietary

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,840
um company there's you know

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
representation for microsoft to

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,559
have literally their own um major

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,320
integration um and

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
and and we have like meetings like this

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,200
one right like you can't

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,280
go to the apple news committee

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
live stream that does not exist right

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,559
and then you can't even like

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,080
probably talk to anyone there right like

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,880
so it's it's very it's like

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,240
fundamentally

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
financially different and so um honestly

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,679
like

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,240
that's just me personally the main thing

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,559
i'm worried about is like i think we're

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,159
most likely the tsc is going to be open

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,440
to this and say like hey let's have a

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
conversation at the very least right

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,400
like why wouldn't you say

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,280
say yes to this but if um

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,799
you know there are no similar signals

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,960
from other members of

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,480
of the of the you know platform

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,559
aggregator community

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
um like those names in the documentary

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,000
apple on facebook

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
then i mean i'm not super convinced this

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,200
is going to be the most productive

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,880
process right so i think the

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,240
it's going to be crucial for for

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,280
you know the new york times and that

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
they i mean i think they're in the

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
leadership position that they might be

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
able to do this

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,400
to actually bring these other companies

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
on the table so that you don't get this

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,480
famous xkcd

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,080
um you know outcome where you you know

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,280
you complain about 13 standards and you

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
have 14.

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,039
um so i think that's one of the thing

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,520
i'm worried about but you know

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:09,840
nevertheless i'm pretty optimistic that

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:09,840
this is a good approach

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
one quick thing um you know i think what

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
malta said is uh

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
salient for this point you know i think

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,080
what is

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
helpful as a publisher is that like i do

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,200
think that there are parts of the

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,720
cat document that identify real problems

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,159
that we do have and so i think it's

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
really helpful to at least

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,880
start that conversation and see whether

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,640
there are ways that we can make it

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,240
better you know in general publishers do

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,360
have pretty small dev teams and you know

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
we are

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,120
then asked to create this kind of

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,880
bespoke formats to be able to

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,400
um sort of uh appear in all these

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
various distribution platforms

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,760
i think one of the real benefits that

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,159
that you know that we saw in

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,159
in amp is that it's also sort of um

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
creating a better user experience it's

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
accessible to

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
anybody on the web not just somebody

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,320
participating in kind of the walled

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
garden ecosystem of one of these other

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,240
aggregation platforms and so for for us

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,840
i think that was sort of what made it

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
like an attractive standard to kind of

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,360
adhere to

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,039
um so i think that like it's certainly a

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,039
worthwhile conversation to

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,200
to have and would you know is is at

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,679
least a proposal for addressing a real

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,679
pain point

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
i wanted to add that from a beginning we

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,880
really

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,240
uh were trying to make amp as unbearable

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
as possible

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
um and it's you know obviously a lot

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,880
more complicated than just being able to

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,840
display

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,960
images and maybe cache them and as an

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,000
example

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,200
in our access of subscription tools

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,799
um as an example here google news can

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,039
uh when publisher option can

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,360
actually replace uh checkout flow to be

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,720
native on android platform

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,400
from uh you know instead of uh running

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,880
some sort of a checkout platform in a

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
which probably would fail

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,880
now there's a lot of uh this kind of

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,919
features we've already

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,039
had a fairly solid experience with

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:14,480
so i think it's definitely worth having

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:18,000
a conversation

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,480
um so speaking of conversations and

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
you know thinking about um how to

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,159
involve i mean more open standards work

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
uh what are problems that the tsc is

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
actively thinking about going into the

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,840
new year

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
i know it's around time where

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,159
organizations are thinking about 2021

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
um hopefully it happens and we don't

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,840
just get a repeat of 2020.

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,360
uh but yeah how how are folks thinking

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
about the new year

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,840
and any efforts that the amp project

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,840
should be picking up

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,279
i'm still really interested in watching

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,880
the capabilities and adoption

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,600
around signed exchange in the sense that

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,880
there's there's still a relatively high

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,559
barrier to entry i think

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,240
on deploying the infrastructure at

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,360
origin and

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,039
but it provides enough benefits from a

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,080
content loading perspective

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,720
um especially as part of the new

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,120
the increasingly leveled playing field

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,039
um represented by core web vitals

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,840
that i um uh i don't know that it's our

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,120
unique

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,279
um burden to shoulder but it um i think

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,320
that it's a potential

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,440
barrier to performance capabilities

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
um that the next year may be a bit make

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,440
or break for

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,440
in terms of adoption

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
can i really quickly say that we're in

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,919
the awkward conversation where the

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,960
person asking the question is the most

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,679
qualified person to answer it

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,240
um so always feel free to also you know

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
give me up

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,039
um i'd echo david i mean okay um

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
sound exchange adoption seeing where

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,279
that goes um

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,520
we've struggled with our own kind of um

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
adoption at pinterest and trying to

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,840
figure out how that

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,000
that fits in um so

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,440
and then i think that combined with core

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,200
web vitals is really interesting core

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,960
web vitals rolled out

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
but um it's been stated that it's gonna

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
you know it's the metrics that are part

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,080
of core web vitals today are not

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
necessarily what are always gonna be

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,720
part

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,279
on how that's composed so seeing how

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,039
that uh um

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,399
kind of changes over time and evolves

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,159
with the web is

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,080
super interesting is staying up to speed

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,279
on that and um

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,799
generally seeing how amp and and the

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,000
metrics that we think about as the

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,240
performance metrics how they

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,159
you know the interplay between um the

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
two ecosystems is really interesting

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
one thing maybe demo can later give some

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
technical details i think bento

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,440
continues to be super

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,360
interesting and something i learned next

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
week next year um

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,720
i think what one one area of research

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,399
that i've i've heard chatter about which

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,679
not hasn't risen to the level of a

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,200
proper project

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,080
um it's just kind of trying to

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,360
compile way more parts of amp and just

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
be

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,080
just be thinner and less of it um the

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
amp optimizer is kind of the first like

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,120
real part of this and you could like

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,399
think that further through of saying

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,159
like how can we

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,440
know that we kind of made that big step

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,880
that we have

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,600
software at the origin um can it do more

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
than um than it does now and and and

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,840
what's the

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,840
what's the real goal there

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,520
and kind of building into like then uh

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,880
into next year's planning kind of a

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,320
question uh

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
which sectors or use cases are the

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,320
highest priority for the mtsc it seems

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,159
like content is number one e-commerce

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,760
seems to be number two

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,520
um but there weren't any e-commerce case

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,000
studies featured at amfest

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,919
um so we did have some e-commerce case

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,960
studies very specifically um

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,559
in like the email section um uh

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,159
section as well um because i think

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,000
there's a lot of usefulness there such

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,159
as for abandoned cart emails

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,919
or just account verification like one of

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
the use cases i am really excited to see

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
is if i

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
get an email saying verify account i

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
shouldn't have to go somewhere else

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
go to another web page confirm and just

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,320
follow 300 steps there

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,840
to just be able to click within the

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,039
email um

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,559
but yeah how do folks do

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,000
does the tse think of that we're going

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,039
to continue focusing on content

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
publishers

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,399
or do we want to expand into more

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
verticals or just

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,159
keep our presence and more verticals and

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
i can also express my opinion here

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,279
cool i will um in that case i will um i

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,520
think

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,559
going into 2021 the the one thing i'm

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,440
really excited about

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,200
is uh page experience and quarterback

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
vitals and how i can really

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,960
push the boundary there uh i think we

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
announced yesterday that about 60

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
of amp domains um passed the corvette by

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,919
those criteria

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
compared to like 12 percent of non-amp

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,640
uh domains

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,480
uh where passing is like at 75

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
percentage of pages um passing the

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,600
criteria

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,840
um i'm not happy with anything less than

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,080
100 uh personally speaking

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,279
um so i think like we have uh we have

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,880
some ways to go there and i'm really

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,480
excited to see the team push that so

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,440
that regardless of what vertical you're

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,440
coming in from

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,200
as long as you pick what part of amp

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,919
really you will benefit from so for

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,760
example

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
you can pick the take an amp carousel

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,960
because you have a lot of cls issues and

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
just have a bento amp page

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,159
um but really you can pick and choose

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,679
what pits of amp work for you to help

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,640
you solve for your corporate vitals or

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,880
your page experience

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,320
uh metrics and problems so that that's

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,080
something that i'm really excited about

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,200
and that allows us to be

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,440
uh mostly um vertical agnostic as well

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,440
here

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,000
i'm actually kind of curious to see how

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,399
web stories could change uh

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,519
e-commerce and how what role they could

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,600
play because

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,039
i feel like every time i see these nice

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,360
stories i almost always want to buy

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,360
something

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
absolutely it's it's the it's the bite

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,000
size consumption they're like oh yeah

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,039
this this looks beautiful and this looks

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,799
highly polished

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,320
yes i will order this pair of shoes

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,360
oh this is not going to be good for my

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,360
wallet but going on

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,480
oh yeah when that's possible 2022

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,559
or road trips uh folks can do those

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,799
right now um

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,080
question from youtube uh will websites

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,840
need to maintain duplicate

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,840
implementations of articles

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,120
that is html and amp version to get

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,519
picked up by

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,519
uh publishers or i assume platforms um

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,940
i have a very strong stance on paradigm

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,840
versus ampersand folks

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,600
[Laughter]

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
i i'm actually really interested in the

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,240
direction of this over the next couple

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,720
years

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,919
in the sense that um we have two

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
different kind of

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,799
paths that are emerging now one of them

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,039
being the more amp first direction where

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,880
you stay completely on the rails you

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,360
take advantage of all of the

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,799
uh performance benefits of completely

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,640
embracing the framework

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,559
possibly even as your canonical

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,000
framework and then we have

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,640
um this other kind of perspective around

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,440
things like bento amp and cor and corweb

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,360
vitals

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,960
where there's more of a sliding scale

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,720
between different functionality and

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
attributes of the page

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,120
and the effects of the bat of the

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,320
balance between capabilities versus

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,120
performance

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
impacts and i think that that will

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,760
affect this a lot

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,080
um uh one of the stances that um we have

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,360
well represented here is is the idea of

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,640
taking amp first

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,000
um which is to uh to build the pages

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,679
completely um in amp and not have

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,159
a of a sort of right so i i almost chafe

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,559
at the

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,279
the idea of regular html because because

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,480
amp is

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,240
is regular html in a sense but it's just

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
a restricted subset of it

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,000
um and that can be that can be a great

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,799
way to not have to

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,440
maintain duplicate articles um but i'm

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,159
definitely

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,600
like going to be watching how much

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
people also choose to say

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,600
don't like do things that are using the

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,440
amp toolkits

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,440
and are still focused on performance but

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
not necessarily passing the validator

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,240
yeah i agree with that like there's

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
never been explicit need to use

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,240
um like a duplicate implementation of

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,279
amp

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,679
uh alongside like a non-amp version but

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,440
what we found over several years is that

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,480
there is in practice kind of some

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,720
barriers to really

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,000
getting there um so i think uh a lot of

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,320
the work and like the things that i'm

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,120
excited about heading into 2021 are

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,240
the approaches by which will make um amp

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,760
you know more approachable and more

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,760
flexible for people

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
to adopt in various ways and bento is

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,120
like really

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,399
at the center of this as well so this

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,960
idea that

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,480
you know you could sort of instead of

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,159
having like a step function where it's

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,520
either like not valid or valid

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,679
there's a graduated path where you can

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,879
um you can get there over time by using

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,679
like parts of amp

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,520
and um and that you're sort of like you

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,960
know while not having like a fully valid

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,720
amp implementation

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,720
um you're starting to be able to get

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,520
some of the benefits along the way and

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,960
you can

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,119
potentially like graduate fully up the

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,960
path to a valid amp page i mean i think

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
it's worth noting like one of the really

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,839
difficult things um

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,760
and i think a lot of the reason that

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,280
there's sort of this paired pattern of

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,879
adoption is it makes it

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,800
a lot easier to kind of reason about it

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,240
first and be able to experiment

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,359
with you know um with investing in amp

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,280
um and so you know i think

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,560
we've recognized that through feedback

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
from the community over the years and i

00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,599
think that there's like a lot of

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,520
projects now that are are really

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,720
squarely focused on and trying to

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
address this pain point

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,960
and so i you know like like david and

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,640
others have expressed i'm really excited

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,240
to see how that plays out and

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,240
would love for the community to continue

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,839
giving us feedback as we as we go down

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,359
that path because

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,880
at the end of the day like you all who

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,480
are really you know

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
taking time day in and day out to invest

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,560
in building up the sites and the pages

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,839
um we'll have the best feedback that we

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,119
can take with us to

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,040
figure out what to do i think

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,240
our experience might be also kind of

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
salient in here

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,839
um you know axios kind of took a

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
different path which was that we were

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,079
going to be

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,680
you know fully rebuilding our site and

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,200
kind of had this opportunity to make a

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
choice of you know which technologies we

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,880
really wanted to bet on and

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,720
we had previous sort of previously done

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,599
like a little experiment and like

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,880
um set up an amp site for the previous

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,880
iteration of axios

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
and had you know seen clear user

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,000
benefits from that and decided that like

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,839
we knew that amp was going to be part of

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,760
the solution and so we really

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,040
ended up you know centering it through

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,440
our development

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,800
um i think that now we are that we are

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,200
we have a fully amp

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
site we are finding some of those pain

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,960
points and i will tell you i

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,240
am i raised my hand a lot here to like

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,640
have this conversation that's part of

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,480
why i wanted to join the tse was to

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,000
to you know help help us navigate but

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,599
also help other publishers kind of

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
navigate the

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,200
you know uh places where like amp is

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,200
both great but there are places where it

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,160
can be a little bit um of a struggle

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,119
you know i do think that the i think it

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,119
is easy to see

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,880
the places where like you know at this

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,359
point where like amp can be

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,480
um a little bit make our build a little

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
bit more complex

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,839
but i do think that there are really

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,359
strong benefits to the

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,280
user experience and i think that those

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,160
are really highlighted by the corporate

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,760
vitals

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,200
statistics so what we're trying to

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
figure out is like how can we figure out

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
how to

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,200
how to kind of fully make this

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,079
implementation work for us and i think

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,240
that that is the

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,480
um you know broad direction that that

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,480
the tsc i think is also engaged in

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,800
so um i'll go into the next question

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,359
um since we did the word pain points it

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
was measure

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,440
uh was mentioned um what are some and

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
like i think this is more

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,400
asking you all to respect on your uh

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
reflect on your own personal experiences

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,119
as web developers or folks working with

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
web developers

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,800
uh what are some of the most common web

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,240
development pain point that your teams

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,880
have individually experienced and how

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:37,839
can

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,839
frameworks or how can amp help here

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,200
kind of just piggybacking off what

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,880
casino was saying um

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,400
about pain points um and performance you

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,079
know most of the pain points

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,560
map directly to um

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,280
an instance where kind of the amp uh

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,800
philosophy

00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,880
puts uh end user uh

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,160
get you know the end user before the

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,560
developer and

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
says that we are not going to compromise

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,800
performance

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,839
for um you know

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,079
one more widget one more ad one more

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,920
kind of a b experiment that doesn't

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,800
really necessarily benefit the user

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,520
um a b experiments in particular one

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,960
because we really

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,079
have interest like the um we do that a

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,800
lot

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,599
but it it kind of conflicts with this

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
privacy

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,079
preserving preload and this amp cache so

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,680
how do we do both you know there's some

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,960
instances where you can say hey

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,800
you can do an experiment on something

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,839
that's later in the page load but

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,839
something that's

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,040
part of the initial paint um no we're

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,400
not going to call back to origin for

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,440
that because that would slow

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,200
the performance down for the end user

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
so those are i think clear interests

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,599
where the decision is

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,760
that the amp framework makes is for the

00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:01,839
user and not for the

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,839
software company

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,480
i feel like uh to be honest like almost

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,040
everything is hard

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,320
i mean way too hard i mean uh starting

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,640
from uh

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,760
server side rendering to

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,800
hydration on a client side uh you know

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
quote spinning all of these issues that

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,880
are state-of-the-art uh

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,839
you know many many many big sites

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,800
solving by

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,839
large teams are still too hard um you

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,560
know dom apis

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,240
themselves at times pretty hard you know

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,200
try to use history api and it's

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,960
uh you know you can sync any amount of

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,800
you know engineering hours

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,520
just trying to figure that out um

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,160
i mean almost everything is uh a bit too

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,640
much

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,200
i absolutely agree a thousand percent

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,880
and

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,320
i think you know there's an illusion

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,839
that sometimes things are easy but then

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,880
you get to production and it's slow

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,160
so i think amp puts the pain

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
up front in a lot of cases and i think

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,599
that's the strength of amp um

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,079
don't make it seem easy if it's not i

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:11,839
guess is something that i i kind of

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,839
agree with

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,319
um we have a question from youtube

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,079
um sorry yep notice that the first

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,119
feedback from the amp page experience

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,079
guide is to use the amp

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,680
optimizer uh wondering about more

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,680
approachable architectural

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,119
more approachable architectural wow this

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,720
is hard wondering about more

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,520
approachable architectural

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,280
options few for html conversion on high

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,280
volume sites

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,920
um i think i reached out and asked about

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,920
a clarification about the approachable

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,880
architectural options but i think

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,160
for amp optimizer very specifically um

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,680
one of the pain points that i want to

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,839
see addressed going into next year

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,319
seeing it be available for more

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,000
uh for more frameworks currently it's

00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,920
available for next year's um

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,520
so if you're um so if you're working in

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,560
next year's you have like optimizable

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
and it's not something you have to think

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
about

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,880
and that is really in my opinion the

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,599
most ideal use case right it just comes

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,040
for free

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,960
it's not something you have to actively

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,880
think about um but then i know it's

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,119
available in the wordpress amp plugin

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,240
netlife somebody from the community

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,880
contributed

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,560
um for netlify as well as well as we

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,520
have an integration with 11t and i want

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,720
to see it be

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,520
uh used in more places automatically

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,480
hopefully and if folks want to take the

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,480
more broader question

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,680
i can try i think this i mean it's it's

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,520
a difficult question the abstract

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,280
because it's unclear that there's a

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,839
problem um

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,000
i think the so

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,920
you know you could there might be a

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,760
problem that it takes too much cpu if

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
you have a very large site

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
um and then it depends a little bit on

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,920
why your site is large like if your site

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,560
is large

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,160
because it it's it has a lot of pages

00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,760
then the right strategy is to do it

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,400
lazily because probably most of them

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,440
no one ever looks at i'm not sure that's

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,359
true for

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
chris's site for example right it

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,240
probably has a lot of web pages that

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,000
don't get a lot of traffic right

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,599
so like they're only exist in theory um

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,560
and and so like that's a very different

00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,200
strategy from if you know from a website

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,240
that um you know maybe at some point

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,319
made the decision that

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,000
static site generator is a good idea and

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,599
now they have a hundred thousand pages

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
and it takes a long time to deploy them

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,680
and adding

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:34,079
um you know 100 millisecond per page um

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,839
html parsing process times 100 000

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,119
is isn't fun right so these are all very

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,079
different different problems

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,520
um i think the the yeah so we

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,920
haven't heard so much feedback around

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,000
this i think where we are seeing

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,440
um you know one interesting development

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,440
is that um

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,640
there's a php version of this now and i

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,560
think and and so

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,079
originally this was like tied into the m

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,960
plugin but that team

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,079
took that out and basically just made an

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,119
amp optimizer that anyone who has a php

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,119
um pipeline can just plug in um

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,319
independent of of using the wordpress

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,359
plugin and

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,800
so um you know one

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,480
interesting development that was really

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,520
recently was the

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,720
um release of the c plus plus

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,040
um uh amp validator

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,760
um that that google is using in

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
production

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,200
so that was previously not available

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,480
open source and it's available open

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,680
source now so you could

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,480
envision that one could build an

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,319
amp optimizer in cpl plus based on that

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,079
relatively easily compared to

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,520
if that wasn't already around um but

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,200
since we actually haven't heard

00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,599
particular feedback that that people

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,640
use so much electricity convert

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,960
optimizing amp pages

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:55,839
i think it's probably not a priority

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,839
right now

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,079
we've got another question coming uh do

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,960
you see amp focusing more on making

00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,040
better

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
uh ui components such as lightbox

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,680
accordion etc or deprioritizing those in

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,040
favor of components that users can build

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,040
themselves using amp script

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,720
i'll take this one i this this is a

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,839
tricky one for me because um

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,480
i'm not sure where we end up netting out

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,720
there's um

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,000
so one of the things i i loved about the

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,520
kind of concept of amp when we were

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,520
initiating the project is the idea that

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,960
there were these components that were

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,400
like super approachable

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,079
like super semantic and i feel it it

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,599
it made people who are maybe even like

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,800
newer to web development

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,720
to be able to like come in and use use

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,640
the amp library to put together web

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,839
pages and they could be really rich in

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,520
terms of the experience that they

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,960
provide like building a light box or

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,720
carousel like

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,560
uh is a pretty complicated thing to get

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,240
right just in terms of like

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,240
you know navigation and performance and

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,200
stuff like that and so i feel like amp

00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,839
put a lot of

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,440
power in into your hands while while

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,720
it's kind of getting pretty close to a

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,760
guarantee that like you would

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,359
you would end up in a good state with um

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
with how you built out that experience

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,040
plus all the other stuff that you wanted

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,839
to do in building up the web page so

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,880
that aspect of amp has always been

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,680
something that i've

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,240
um really cherished about it and we have

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,839
put

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,520
investment in recent years into things

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,560
like lightbox and carousel to make those

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,839
better so

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,920
um i think i could see sort of more

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,800
continuity of that um it'd be

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,240
interesting to hear if there's like

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,599
feedback around specific components

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,640
where you see there's like opportunities

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,400
or gaps

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,000
on the other hand and going back maybe a

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,359
bit to the e-commerce question that came

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,160
up earlier as well

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,680
so things like amp scripts can actually

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,880
be used to drive amp and

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,440
and to get to sort of um you know

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,560
more more nuanced u cases you know be

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,280
able to get more power

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,680
out of amp and so i think that that has

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
been

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,000
a path that has been useful in helping

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,800
to address the e-commerce use cases that

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,920
we've been

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,119
looking at over the years and so um you

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,640
know i think

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,800
to the extent that further investment in

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,640
that area is merited i think you know

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,480
that that that could make sense but i

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,359
don't i don't necessarily see us like

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,880
saying oh

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,720
we're we're going to see this shift away

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,880
from like the components toward like

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,079
okay all that stuff becomes scripting

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,839
it's part of amp script like i don't

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,359
know if i see that but i you know i

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,480
could see maybe a little bit

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,880
uh script to be able to handle some of

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
the more

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,640
those more nuanced use cases power use

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,359
cases in general

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,800
um but what i'd also say is like across

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,720
all of these things i think

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,880
what i'm you know reiterating what i'm

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
really excited about in 2021

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,839
and this is groundwork that we've laid

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
so far this year has actually been

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
thinking about

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
amp like super holistically too um not

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,319
even along these

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,319
specific dimensions like thinking about

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,640
things like bento and ways that we can

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,800
make

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,240
amp more flexible so that you kind of

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
you know just change the details of how

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,400
you

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,480
how you interact with amp you kind of

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
change like the whole sort of mindset

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,119
that you might have in approaching amp

00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
are the options that you see on the

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,599
table for building with amp

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,400
and so um that is like a third kind of

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,560
path of investment that i think is is

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,839
open to the project and i do see us

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,000
investing significantly in that

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:12,560
direction in the coming year

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,680
i i also wanted to add that high level

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,000
semantic components

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,200
are also much better for accessibility

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,920
in the sense that

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,359
when things get implemented that way as

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,480
long as the component supports an

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,119
accessible interface

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,640
things like say keyboard navigation

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,400
various tagging of

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,319
the function of the element that comes

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,480
basically for free with using that

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,880
element whereas if it gets built up from

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,720
scratch using something like amp script

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,920
in many cases it just won't be

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,920
implemented accessibly

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,559
i i agree with that i also you know

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,319
thinking that

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,839
a lot of the accessible components

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,960
they're also accessible to

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:56,160
other type of clients like even uh

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,480
search search indexers and so on in

00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,280
annoying that semantic information

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,640
is useful personally every time i open

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,839
an amp page

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,119
source code and just being able to see

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,440
where ads are

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,720
or where analytics events are sort of

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,920
very declaratively

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,599
it's actually very very very helpful um

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
i mean part of the answer could be that

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,480
we could see how where you know our

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,800
developers

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,480
you know take take all of this you know

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,760
how much they use sunscreen versus

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,880
components

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,880
but part of it we're also getting

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,319
feedback that uh

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,480
people wanted to be able to use our

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,200
components outside of even amp

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,839
which is why you know inventor project

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,839
exists

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,800
uh we're roughly 10 more minutes so i'll

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,760
take i'll take two or three more

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,079
questions

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,359
um the next one is should publishers or

00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,839
companies

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,599
um be encouraged or penalized for

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,119
favoring certain websites over others

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,160
based on the underlying technology

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,599
versus content

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,960
i think this is why i'm really excited

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,680
about things like core by vitals and

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,680
page experience

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,200
i'll i'll try to take that one before i

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,880
think malta wants to speak as well but

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,319
i can take it first i was going to say

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,800
no

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,160
yeah yes that's a very yeah that's a

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,440
very good answer uh

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,440
um no uh and i like

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,960
i'm here like representing microsoft and

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,480
what we do for search and then

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,079
like there are folks from from google

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,520
here uh

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,680
for me with like what matters uh like

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
the web vitals are a perfect picture of

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,760
what what matters

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,119
for us like even though like microsoft

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,200
for being we don't have

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,079
the same thing as web vitals like we use

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,119
similar very similar

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,760
very similar signals to to do

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,079
that and what matters is performance

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,400
content

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,280
the underlying technology doesn't matter

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,960
at all right

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,880
you can use an app you can use any

00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,319
script any any framework

00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,640
you can do all server-side rendering

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:02,079
your client side it doesn't matter

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,359
what matters is the is the page quick

00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,760
like uh are the sign signals there

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,640
is the content good and so on and so

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,960
forth so

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,880
the short answer no no no no no no

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,319
yeah i can echo that um on the other

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,520
side of the coin um you know there's a

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,520
perception i think that

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,119
might do amp for seo but having core web

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,960
vitals

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,440
lets us point at the fact that hey the

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,400
amp pages are still faster

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,720
and as long as the amp pages are faster

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:41,839
there's not much of an argument

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:41,839
that we should switch it up

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,000
i'll ask um i'll see if there's any more

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,280
questions coming in right

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,480
um i feel like i don't have the memory

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,240
to answer this question but at the

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,160
contributor summit it was mentioned

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,839
that amp runtime might give you a pwa

00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,880
out of the box for navigating amongst

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,839
amp pages

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:09,839
is there are there any updates on that

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:09,839
my recollection fails me here

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,720
i would say this is a great place to go

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,760
plug the amp project github which is go

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,200
dot amp dot dash

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,720
github and i'm sure somebody from the

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,680
runtime or the performance working group

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,680
can answer your questions there better

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,400
i mean and i'm not sure it's the same

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,599
thing but we do have a pwa

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,319
runtime for some historical reasons i

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,359
think it's

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,800
called shadow runtime and it allows you

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,440
to load a um document

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,079
in a pwa um using all the amp technology

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,960
using um possibly prerendering and

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,040
everything else

00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,960
uh and uh you know

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,520
uh there are think couple good examples

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,520
there as well

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,680
uh a new question any chance that we'll

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,280
have bento

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,520
in reverse which is letting folks

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
leverage save react in an amp page

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,359
with amp script that is embed reactant

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,559
amp versus embedding amp in react

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,280
that's probably the second hardest

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,839
sentence i've read today

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,839
um

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,599
i i mean i'm guessing the end so i i

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,240
feel like dima can opine on this

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,240
probably the best

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,280
but um i'm guessing the answer is no

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,559
chris baxter demoed this it works really

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,440
yeah because my understanding is that

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,480
the the actual

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,880
the the defining property that

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,559
distinguishes say bento components from

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,400
one's running in a

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,920
in a fully validated amp page is that

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,240
there are certain constraints

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,839
that cannot be assumed to hold once you

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,319
start going beyond the

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:58,240
boundaries of a valid amp page and once

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,400
you unlock

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,920
um once you unlock the ability to

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,040
basically do anything

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,640
with a framework say like react

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,559
um then a lot of the constraints that

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,599
the amp components depend on

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,200
in a fully validated amp page probably

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,480
can't hold anymore

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,079
um but i mean chris facts could demo

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,400
this i think there was

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,800
yeah maybe you don't want to do it it's

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
possible

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,319
i would say something lighter like react

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,880
maybe

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,599
go for it yeah we have amp script uh

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,640
where which

00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,079
uh has a fairly you know unlimited

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,880
amount of technology that can be used

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,440
with it

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,839
and deployed there um you know react we

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,640
have examples in react and pre-act

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,280
um another there are definitely

00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,280
limitations

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,559
you know you could what amp wants to

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,760
observe instead of amp script but

00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,319
um it's a basically open-ended app that

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,599
can be hosted inside of a

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,960
separate thread it has a some sort of a

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,640
sandbox around it

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:13,280
and can be included on any amp page

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,040
yeah i think the demo that it's kind of

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,119
i was talking earlier about how like i'm

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,200
kind of going away and it's

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,160
it this is kind of the interest this is

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,400
the direction

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,000
that all of this is kind of going to

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,040
right you can definitely

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,240
um imagine stuff like

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,240
this happening and um

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,280
i you know i think beyond the demo you

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,440
can actually do it today

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,960
right um it's definitely interesting

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,880
area of research how

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,640
how such program programming models

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,400
could look like in the in the future

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,160
and when it's all a little bit better

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,880
tied together um

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,400
i but you know amp script does put

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,680
constraints on you so for example you

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,960
can't just set up a timer

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,200
and keep updating the page right or um

00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,799
so there's constraints like that because

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,920
um like you have to have a user action

00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,000
to make changes and

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,839
so those are definitely handled

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,359
independent of

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,880
whatever technology is actually used

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,400
inside of the

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:11,599
um of the worker

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,799
actually uh i think uh i'm script

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,880
cancelling timer they just

00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,920
you just can't violate uh the size of a

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,880
page or

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,160
uh you know the uh content layout shift

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,200
basically constraints

00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,240
right yeah that's what i meant

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,400
um also the demo that uh chris was

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,160

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,920

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,920
uh when we could all travel uh so yeah

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,559
if you this is a great point to actually
