of this notes foundation and the open

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,780
J's foundations security working group

introduce quickly just who's on the

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,640
panel today we have Michael Dawson

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:56,239
vladimir deter crime myself and right at

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,949

and so first of all thank you for

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,539
joining us if you're now on the live

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,339
coal or they recorded one just some like

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,040
cleanup stuff so that you know how to do

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,970
this if you want to shoot any questions

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,799
over basically we have this forum over

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,380
and the that you can submit a Google

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,720
Form so basically if you find the open

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,640
JSF on Twitter there's there's a Twitter

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,820
she digitally find it probably on the

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,280
top one just got her and and I submit

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,939
the question you can also basically

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,590
probably tweet towards any any of us on

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,320
the panel here as well I will probably

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,850
monitor and ask you that and without

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,070
further ado guess I guess I'll go ahead

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,299
and let the folks introduce themselves

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,150
so Michael do you want to start your

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,189
really first one of my on my screen okay

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,040
yeah I I'm Michael Dawson IBM's

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,079
community lead for nodejs that lets me

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,100
spend a lot of time in the community I'm

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,100
a member of the technical steering

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,020
committee and a member of a number of

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,570
working groups I haven't been quite as

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,579
active as as as recently in the security

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,159
working group but it is an area that I

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,540
have an interest as people said to me

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,680
yesterday you know you can see I have a

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,140
background in nodejs

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,330
but I also have a background in security

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,629
from some earlier jobs where I worked on

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,680
some crypto products and working on you

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,549
know physical

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
and information type security mica I

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,760
already have one question for you and

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,120
that is when you worked on crypto did

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,549
you roll your own crypto it's a tricky

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,739
question we didn't we didn't make our

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,230
own crypto it was back in the days of

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,620
DES and Triple DES and actually you know

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:39,230
things like RSA and almost he was just

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,180
starting to turn to come into play so

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:47,970
sounds good alright buddy Murray

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,400
alrighty you oof I'm glad I'm way less

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,069
than everywhere on the node.js projects

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,810
that make sure I think a couple years

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,209
ago Mike helped him so we took some

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,950
wacky vacation and half of the working

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:07,319
group the load project actually inactive

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:11,090
I am mostly focusing on the security

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,769
working group and trying to add some

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,250
instrumentation friendly features into

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:20,340
nuria's you might know me for the sync

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,590
local storage which I am one of the main

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,180
author of if you don't know about this

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,209
awesome API it's not really about

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,250
security but it should change the way

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,840
you see nodejs and you cool with notes

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,579
so take a look at that and premium that

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,199
a good one I was so happy to get that

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:42,269
measure it's pretty new it's like

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:44,639
February merged and when I'm not doing

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,709
goofy stuff and the node.js project I

00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,000
had a day work at a company named a

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,159
screen where we actually do application

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,859
security so I'm someone who works

00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,379
full-time and nodejs security and web

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:04,099
security at large and that's pretty much

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,689
how I got into this for a mah oh

00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:09,060
whatever thanks for the ping idea

00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,639
I think stuff I mean that's that's been

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:18,840
a incredible work and now it was super

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:23,669
useful what is it yeah I'll keep it

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,840
short some I'm part with together with

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,710
Michael and Vladimir

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,230
under security working group for node

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,880
have been doing a lot of community

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,919
JavaScript and security stuff you know

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,330
all over the past recent years I'm a

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,510
developer advocate at snake where would

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,360
you def first security some really

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,650
honored I'm happy to do this am a here

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,900
and I think we already have some

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,230
questions and maybe even one on the

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,520
tweet for you a polymer with that that

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:56,160
hacker finger coming up there so do we

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,470
maybe want to just give just a brief

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,820
overview of what is the security working

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,800
group anyone I want to take this up I'm

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,050
happy to jump in on that like that the

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
security working group actually was

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,090
formed and I forget how many years ago

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,010
but it was around the time that there

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,610
was the donation of the node Security

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,669
Project database so one of the areas

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,160
that it's focused on has been you know

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,380
taking vulnerability reports and adding

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,820
adding to that database it's also

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:33,840
focused on you know areas where we can

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,930
provide you know guidance or techniques

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,460
for the larger module ecosystem to

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,070
improve security or to make things

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,800
easier for maintainer x' to do that what

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,340
it what it isn't is it's not necessarily

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,930
focused on node core security things

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,550
like vulnerabilities that are reported

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,280
to the core project are handled through

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,070
the the TSE and you know some other

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
processes I'm security releases again or

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,210
something that you know is handled by

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,180
the the node core and the technical

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,389
steering committee so I'd say it focuses

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,190
on security but not for a node core

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,169
itself not necessarily but more on the

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,039
ecosystem and what we can do in terms of

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,150
the node ecosystem in the modules I

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,990
don't know if I had merely ran if I've

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,550
missed out anything on on that front I

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,280
think that's a pretty good overview I

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,430
really want to add anything it seems

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,020
pretty accurate and the conference here

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,729
yeah I'd say we aren't running for a

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,340
long time I think it was the sense that

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:36,419
2016 the end of that were everything got

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,610
you know quite busy with more people I

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,199
remember my first first

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,380
and I know it's accurate working group

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:47,130
it was super hectic and busy in a good

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,979
way I guess I kind of owe it back to get

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,960
get busy on that again but I mean

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,120
Michael your uh your description is

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,280
already like kind of like relating to

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,560
one of the questions we have which is

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,330
you know what are the general

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,710
responsibilities of this Noah security

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,440
working we're right like what are the

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,990
charters you know what are we kind of

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,490
like tasked to do and I think you had

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,199
like a little bit of servation sort like

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,910
it's kind of like a split first there is

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,139
the ecosystem security working group

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,150
which is kind of like what we're trying

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,700
to become more like ecosystem

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,910
responsibility like you mentioned the

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,550
NPM modules and so on and then there's

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,840
the other side of it which is more

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,540
correlated like I don't know what

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,400
correlated security activities you know

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,710
whether that's crypto and other other it

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,060
does do it right

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,800
yep yeah and if people want to look

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,250
specifically with the Charter is you can

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,960
go to you know no GS / Security -

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,880
working group and there's a charter

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,039
section that will like introduce you to

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,889
the very specific things that we've

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:53,070
defined there sure and I think it's also

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,960
worth like noting I guess for me before

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,530
joining things I've sent you know very

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,330
you know very big and massive from

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,500
outside like what is the node project

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,320
you know how do we get involved it's

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,940
like in very opaque but it's really

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,289
worth noting here like a lot of the

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,210
things we do like basically everything

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,260
we do except you know critical stuff

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,789
like you know try adding the

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,550
vulnerability reports which requires its

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,169
own a discrete way of doing it now

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,660
everything is pretty transparent so like

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,669
that link that will show later on

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,740
Twitter and what Michael had just

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,090
provided you that's basically how the

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,910
repository everything is very

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,860
transparent any pull requests changes

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,570
any issues any things you want to chime

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:37,050
on the node a script working or is also

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:39,630
is also having this one monthly one one

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,570
monthly call every time so actually have

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,890
one next week on Atherton of July so if

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,350
you you know want to jump up you know

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,820
ask any questions you can also add

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,900
questions by the way here to the YouTube

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,080
chat too as well

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,700
offer the AMA so you know it's very open

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,520
and we're always looking for you know

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,200
new new new people to join us you know

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,960
give us a new first perspective and so

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,990
on so there's definitely a dad to the

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,310
project if you wanted to get involved

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,130
yeah I think that's a really good point

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,290
in that you know I hear that you know

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,700
the project itself is quite big there's

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,220
lots going on and can be a little bit

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,530
intimidating sometimes for people to get

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,270
involved like you said everything is

00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,160
really transparent but sometimes I think

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,320
it's more the fear of the unknown than

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,940
anything else and I think that the

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,340
working groups in general are a great

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,650
way to actually get to meet a few of the

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,810
people I'm always surprised that like

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,100
how few people actually are driving

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,920
things so if you you know if you imagine

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,300
that you know it's a huge project with

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,740
lots and lots of collaborators which we

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,830
do have a good number of collaborators

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,270
but there's lots of things going on so

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,680
that you know the people in each of the

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,780
different areas it's not like you're

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,330
gonna come in to a group of 50 or

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,850
whatever it's usually you know four or

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,950
five you know regular members and it's a

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,170
great way to get to know them make the

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,340
contacts and so if you look for a

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,220
working group that's kind of in your

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,320
interest rate area it's a great way to

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,150
understand more about the project figure

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,340
out that it's just you know people and

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,840
you know people who are friendly because

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,550
the project's very focused on making

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,530
sure that everybody's friendly and you

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,710
know helps new people so it's a great

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,300
way to get in and and you know we'd love

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,950
to see more people who are interested in

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,230
security come out to the the security

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:24,180
working group actually is a journey into

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,920
contributing to node if that's

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,070
interesting I came took quickly about

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,310
mine it was it started by randomly

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:36,270
treating a lot about node and writing

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:39,650
articles and and proposing content for

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:43,440
the defect evangelism working group and

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,330
at one point I saw that the security

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,820
working group preserving bootstrapped

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,310
and working full-time in security for

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,950
nodejs I was like I'm better inside that

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,700
and outside and little by little I just

00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:00,030
learned to meet people how the project

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:03,780
works and it becomes quickly from the

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,670
people who make node them to make sure

00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,890
no cement abuse and might

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,750
and Anna oh yeah I know they may see

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:15,900
them twice a year and my friend and

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,520
becoming like this small world and just

00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,790
looking back you're just impressed by

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,490
the the journey you had from just

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,560
tweeting stuff about node and ending up

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,850
in a main that and that's actually

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,360
accessible to anyone like we write bugs

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:36,830
some of us more than others mostly I

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,690
write tags and we are not super romantic

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,250
science and I'm really happy when I see

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,010
new contributors coming to the node

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,890
project highlighting security stuff we

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,730
haven't seen fixing bugs we haven't seen

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,680
and the hard part of the job is who to

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,500
make them who do we make them know that

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,260
they can regularly be involved in the

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,000
community and how can we invite them and

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,430
I think that's the part where working

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,290
group as you said is a good entry point

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,930
because you start to contribute you meet

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,510
the people and you end up earring node

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,950
and getting commit rights on that after

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,470
a couple more years that's a lot more

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,910
since you will mentioned up your writing

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,990
a lot of bugs and introducing a lot of

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,210
bugs gonna take you up on that and maybe

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,980
I'll connect that to if you can Sharon

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,470
tell us a bit about this bug bounty

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,200
program that the node foundation has and

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,990
what is it what are we gonna do there

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:37,260
how is that related that's an

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,960
interesting question so there's actually

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,600
one thing about bugs that I like a lot

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,350
is that some of them can be security

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,780
rated not all of them that's some bugs

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,160
actually provided security exploits and

00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,020
some bugs you can even get money for

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,320
right you can actually make money by

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,750
finding security bugs right good part is

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,940
that we have a sponsor which is the IBB

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:08,820
the Internet backbone T so it's pool of

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,520
funding companies I think there are big

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,780
players and smaller fishes inside that

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,000
and and actually those people are

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,200
willing to pay to make no des and its

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,630
ecosystem safe

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,630
we also have a few private companies

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:28,110
were pledged money directly which means

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,610
that right now we have a way and we have

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:35,190
the fund to pay people for makings

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:38,100
nodejs ecosystem or nuria's core even if

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:42,329
that's another program outside of the

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:45,149
security working group safer meaning

00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:50,279
that if you find good birds and good

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:53,250
bugs are not missing semicolons or very

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,820
small things I know that request library

00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:01,320
can be used to being outside api's don't

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,910
call an SS Arif and request please don't

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,250
highlight Berg's

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:10,709
in the test of libuv we had a security

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:16,970
report for our tests that was injectable

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,970
in a vendor project which on AIX only

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:25,949
rented OS so please be serious and

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,260
depending on the popularity of the repo

00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,660
and the severity on the burg we can

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,310
avoid swings like I think last week we

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,350
awarded two hundred and fifty dollars

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,449
for us here you see issuing a very

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,100
popular repo and that's the kind of

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,100
thing where you can make a bit of money

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,820
and fame they making the world a better

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:50,130
place where can they find us what what's

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,959
the place to our good we also are

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,870
blessed by another sponsor which is

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:58,589
actual one which provide us with free

00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,620
high current programs so you can find us

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:05,040
on hacker one ecosystem or a cure one no

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,680
disco for car and both of the links are

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,640
the labor of the new GS website enter

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,550
the security tab so I have just good

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,430
news is that all click security and all

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,170
the links will be there and you will be

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,980
able to spammers with a lot of very

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,720
critical vulnerabilities yeah I'll take

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,730
this opportunity to poke it a little bit

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
more painful side of this the bug bed

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,069
the bug bounties are great but really

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,880
you know we'd like to encourage I think

00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:35,750
working

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,130
close with closely with the project

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,480
versus looking for bugs to be able to

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,120
make money here you know it's great to

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,500
get a bit of a bonus there but there has

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,110
been a little bit of friction in the

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,389
community in terms of you know hey

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,399
people get paid to report bugs but then

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,810
the the the maintainer has to go and fix

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,839
them and they're not necessarily getting

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,220
paid and and okay so you got what does

00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,610
your shirt say there I could didn't

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:03,000
quite catch it it was like peda lets me

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,310
remove the virtual background okay I

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,990
actually just got that delivered i had

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,050
to install survey and i got this for

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,050
free

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:16,500
bounty - yes so yeah i thought i'd just

00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,089
see like Loran an invited me to your

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,680
take on that because it's it's great

00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:21,269
that we have the bug bounty in place but

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,790
i can see that there's this there's a

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,860
bit of tension between like a yeah we're

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,230
incenting people to generate work for a

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,990
different group and you know how do we

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,110
deal with that going forward that's

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,560
actually a great question and that's

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:40,800
actually the question about monetizing

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,949
open source and on a very specific part

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,480
which is okay you've got monetizing

00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:48,959
people for their daily work and you've

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,470
got monetizing paying people for saving

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,839
everyone's production or infrastructure

00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:00,089
by fixing the critical security bits and

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:03,329
that the question is money the solution

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:06,390
is pledging I don't really have a

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:10,130
solution last year a three years ago I

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:13,770
was invited to a panel and all the

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,799
society named the maintainer if I recall

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:19,020
properly and we did a daily workshop

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,409
with a philosopher about who will

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:26,429
maintain the maintainer where do people

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:28,500
who maintain code and make the thing the

00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,630
label and walk for a long time

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,250
get the retribution because we've got

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,490
the creature on the internet and

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:40,260
open-source in programming to reward the

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:42,360
creator they're all my first creator and

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,990
they get the glory and they get to sell

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,750
the project for instance in some cases

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,360
but what happens

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,610
for the other people and writes note and

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,310
no J's project as a few a very

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,460
ultimately active member I think if we

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,980
render commits by by a member over the

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,380
next six months or 12 months we will

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,990
realize that some people are more

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,950
invested in are very invested in fixing

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:12,430
bugs and making the project we were

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:14,380
powerful who how do we reach with them

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,410
do we want to atribute them should they

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,350
be do they want to be recommitted

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:24,610
actually I think I don't have an answer

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:27,850
it's too big for me I'm just thought

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,130
that my mind was we have bug bounties

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,220
for reporting of vulnerability I wonder

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,380
if there should be like a bonus to bring

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:44,050
like if you report a vulnerability and

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:45,730
you come with effects yeah

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,440
make it easier for maintainer to kind of

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,560
like you know just just merge the code

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,630
right exactly like when you have that

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,950
right you know cuz that I've seen that

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,810
happen sometimes which is like hey I

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,040
found this problem and here's the fix

00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,390
and if it's something where you can just

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,180
say oh okay well that's good we

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,970
understand it fix often makes it very

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:07,510
clear what the impact is gonna be to you

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,190
know putting the fix into the code if it

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,600
passed the test so so that would

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,190
actually make it a lot easier I think on

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,380
maintainer x' to say okay and and

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,150
probably you know there be cases where

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,790
it might need to be reworked or tweak

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,320
but i think like so yeah that just

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,760
popped in my mind though like hey maybe

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,830
there could be like hey you get the base

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,720
bone at bounty but you get double if

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:34,630
you've got to fix as well or something

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:38,890
so so I would like that because it will

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,980
drive toward a change of mind in the

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,110
backbone tea scene because one thing is

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,800
actually a spot and you've got people

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:52,600
who me and that's that's actually a

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,340
thing and but I remember a longer

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,370
article from someone who shall not be

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,490
named but which was about hey you found

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:04,090
a big security bug in my huge

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,070
days well no I have to fix it and I

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,460
agree with you and maybe we could have a

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,070
bonus next rally world or maybe a spritz

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:15,370
a bounty between the person who fixes a

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,870
bergen person who found it yeah yeah

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,400
that's another good option just thinking

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,020
of different ways to like yeah like you

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,690
said sort of change the dynamics a

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,760
little bit to make it a we're trying to

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,679
solve the end problem as opposed to just

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:33,270
the first part yeah also it's worth

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:37,600
noticing that it depends also who owns

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:42,040
the repo so in the case of the nodejs

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,220
project it's the dynamic we've been

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,830
discussing on the system side we we

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,790
happened to meet birds on repos that

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,679
belongs to commercial organizations that

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,920
are not community maintained and

00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,190
actually the first time it happened all

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,470
of that is public but the the company

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,540
actually it was before we had bug

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,210
bounties for a bunty's for the ecosystem

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,030
the company actually awarded 500 the

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,700
last 20 to the person who reported it

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,500
and I guess the dynamic is different

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,210
when it's a community project that is

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:21,790
maybe unfunded or you know sponsored by

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,570
the employers of the people work on that

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,640
or projects that are not fully open

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,070
source because I belong to a companies

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,740
are not community driven and belong to a

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,770
company I mean I would be more less keen

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,840
toward changing the dynamic for that

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,809
because there's already someone paying

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,540
and someone handling the the dynamic but

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:46,360
for the nodejs project yeah we probably

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,000
have a story here that we want to write

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,370
together yeah I know I'd agree that you

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,260
know the answer for open source projects

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,880
versus proprietary projects would be

00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:00,040
different there so so I guess we already

00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,320
have if you wanted to like volunteer and

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,790
jump up put something to work with a

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,010
security working group well we have one

00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,350
idea from from Michael like maybe we

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,390
have we have this bug bounty kind of

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,610
like policy it's it's just really file

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,230
you know that we culture so we can read

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,690
through that you know if that idea for

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,350
Michael

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,210
makes sense and you know Wladimir

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,610
commentary on that as well can go ahead

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,890
and push that into maybe a PR or open an

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:28,280
issue suggestion and we can see how to

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:31,430
kind of like with it in worth noting we

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,440
also have this idea of trying to see

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,060
with this problem of like open source

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,200
and maintain as writer is a friction dur

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,320
and we're trying to make their lives

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,270
also easier as much as we can and so

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,760
we're trying to figure out how we can

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,840
use the hacker 1 as a platform as well

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,460
- also sorry to also record maintainer

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,860
x' for their time fixing something not

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,570
just the security researchers so if you

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,920
have ideas there as well and how to you

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,770
know make that work since that's not

00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,350
like an out of the box working thing we

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,670
we hugger 1 you know definitely chime in

00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,450
and you know let's see what we can do

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,810
together on this I think there was a

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,150
comment on some of the discussion on the

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:14,420
the YouTube chat around there are some

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:17,480
challenges around basically being able

00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:19,880
to provide a patch because that you know

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,070
we have we have thought about the the

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,660
responsible security disclosures but

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,460
that part might actually need some

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,100
enhancement as well to allow it to come

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,700
along with or have the patch I guess

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,290
today we use hacker one where we people

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,090
can open issues and in that issue we

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,490
could certainly attach a patch I assume

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,930
right yeah so we can get patches if

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,910
you're doing this through hacker one and

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:44,810
this is something that we usually to get

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:47,180
on but I think Bryan's points is

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,660
interesting I think github is rolling

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,460
out a feature with private peers but I

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,630
don't know how that works for people who

00:23:52,460 --> 00:24:01,510
are outside of the organization

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:03,950
regarding access to that also hi Bryan

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,200
who is another member of the working

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,470
group but yeah I think right now the

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,920
only flow is to attach a patch file of

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,800
the iq1 and pry it from private search

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:20,330
as a repos yeah that's what we've

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,850
questioned so far alright so as we're

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,290
talking about a lot of out like you know

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,030
patches and fixes and maintain errs and

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,130
you know open source security

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,550
I'll go ahead and ask for this panel you

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,230
know

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,880
what a search out some challenges that

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,320
we're seeing you know as a security

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,020
working group you know that works in

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,309
this space with with the community what

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:44,470
are some challenges were having I will

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:50,210
take that one I think if that what I

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:53,630
think fatigue and the amount of work is

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,670
actually really big and is that on the

00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,429
maintainer side or on the working group

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:02,390
side are different on the working group

00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:07,190
side at least for ending ecosystem there

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:09,350
it is actually this I'm not involved a

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,620
lot anymore in charging vulnerabilities

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,280
because it's I've done that intensively

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:23,540
for couple years at the beginning and

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:27,110
time-consuming process also you're

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,750
between the hammer and the the metal

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,330
meaning that you've got a backbone tree

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,820
coming from one direction the report and

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,830
you have to evaluate if that's valid

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,460
thing and sometime it's really hard and

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,700
challenging

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,010
you've got maintainer that we probably

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,070
that might you know you or might take

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,300
time to and sure that the worst case

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,610
scenario in during the worst case

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,590
scenario usually maintain nails are

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,240
pretty happy and we've got great

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,870
interaction reason because an odious

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,660
committee is amazing but in the worst

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:02,000
situations maintain our happy or they

00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,429
ignore you and at the end you published

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,690
and maybe some people I'm not happy with

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,880
divinity finished

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,980
maybe the rights maybe they are not I'm

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,750
not here to debate that but you might

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,370
have also after public back slashing and

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,550
it's actually an energy and time

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:22,690
consuming process and actually we've got

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:27,410
a distribution into reducing the scope

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:30,260
because the panel of vulnerability

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,780
monitoring has changed when we started a

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,240
few years ago there was an odious

00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,370
security project giving up on that there

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,520
was sneak big in that and that was

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,700
pretty much all the actors in

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,690
vulnerability management

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,809
for no js' no npm has gone this way

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:53,969
github is doing it those are the same

00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:56,129
entity and things are changing and maybe

00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:58,649
the need for the security working group

00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:00,209
handling the report for the wood and

00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,549
piano system which is still

00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:07,049
exponentially growing in number of

00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:09,389
packages maybe there is maybe this need

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:12,419
and that's my personal opinion maybe

00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:15,059
this needs to be updated also other

00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,369
things that changed a lot is that the

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,559
node.js foundation merged into 0

00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:22,409
countries foundation meaning that we are

00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,859
sibling projects from amazing stuff like

00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:28,799
no dread yes lint I think grant is part

00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:32,909
of that and maybe we should be focusing

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,539
in being a service team and McGuinty

00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:38,849
team for the project of the foundation

00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:41,609
rather than handling the word npm scope

00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:44,039
where I determine NPM can do that better

00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:47,309
than us now and obviously other

00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:51,029
commercial companies and that's a

00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:53,549
personal opinion and not spokesperson or

00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:56,940
from screen or open J's formation or

00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:59,700
secretary yes if I have to kind of like

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,919
recap that there is a fatigue coming up

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,859
though they think on on maintainer as as

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,719
well as the working group individuals to

00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,759
you know there's a lot of contexts week

00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:10,049
it's not it's not like I think you know

00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,089
the context is when you trash your

00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:13,829
vulnerability it's not like you go

00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,419
through it you spend one hour so and

00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,619
then you know it's like it's an

00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,039
end-to-end thing and you finish it and

00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,690
so on

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,099
there's reaching out to the maintainer

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,659
as you know then you know maybe they

00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,279
reply back a day later then you need to

00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,440
go into the issue again you know see

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,179
what you were working on you know see if

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,039
you know what they comment makes sense

00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,409
or not you know connect maintainer xand

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,909
and bug researchers and I'll take that

00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,950
and you know multiply that across maybe

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,379
tens or hundreds of reports that you

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,479
know might have you know in your queue

00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:41,129
to kind of like crash and you know the

00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:43,829
context switching and that work is I

00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:47,249
think what we're finding as a fatigue

00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:49,499
for for the individuals but nevertheless

00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:50,759
super important and so chemic your

00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:52,979
second statement there polymer is uh

00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,530
it's maybe we're trying to focus it

00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:57,200
because for a long long time I think

00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,970
the working group you are also receiving

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,620
you know reports for four modules of

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,850
have you know tens of downloads a week

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,920
or a month and you know it's not that

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,650
you know dirty less important so we took

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,170
them on as well but they're just less

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,490
impactful you know less impactful if

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,480
they know there's a vulnerability and

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,760
something that gets you know if

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,490
downloaded ten times a week you know

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,050
that's not gonna be a really good you

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,330
know return on investment for us for

00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,770
example now working to try a set and so

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,990
we're trying you know we try to do a

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,570
couple of things are like rating buckets

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,190
of reports and so there's like no low

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,340
and medium and maybe how I kind of like

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:34,260
impactful modules and now I think with

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,900
your kind of like focus here is like

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,880
we're trying to also maybe saved or

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,500
something like more specific to the open

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,610
Jazz foundation that we're trying to

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,580
kind of like refocus the work of the

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,550
working group right yeah that's correct

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,140
I mean certainly for me it's it's that

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,960
you know the point you made about the

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,120
landscape having changed you know at the

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,680
time the time the formation is I think

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,590
it was like four years ago as Lauren was

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,350
was recalling you know their the the

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,300
database needed a home and you know

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,090
there was concern over having a sort of

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,860
a neutral database and and making sure

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:14,490
that there was a place it seems like you

00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,160
know time goes past and you know we're

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:19,950
more comfortable with the alternatives

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,410
they're more defined and so it may make

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:26,670
sense to just defer to those those

00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:28,830
reporting processes for the bulk of the

00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,180
projects and modules as long as you know

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,290
if we've got a good home for that then

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,400
you know as you said it's a lot of work

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,040
we haven't necessarily been able to keep

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,820
up with all of them so if you know just

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,100
generally and to the other ones could

00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,930
make a lot of sense I think in terms of

00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,870
the you know having joined the open J's

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:48,960
foundation security still is is a

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,330
challenging I shouldn't say problem but

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,810
it's like it's a it's a fairly specific

00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,460
technical area and I think not everybody

00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:58,110
it's hard for people for every

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,480
maintainer to be up to speed and to

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:03,000
figure out what best practices are and

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,970
so I think there's still a very strong

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,350
value proposition for for a group of

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,670
people coming together whether it's

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,389
called the node.js security working

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,889
group or its

00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:14,489
got something else under the foundation

00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:16,739
to come together and to try and help you

00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:18,809
know potentially with a first priority

00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:21,929
on the the projects that are part of the

00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:24,149
the open GS foundation because as a as a

00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:26,429
group we want to make sure that you know

00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:28,320
we're doing the right thing to on the

00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:31,619
security front but also like you know

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,929
defining best practices and and things

00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:36,629
that are applicable to the broader

00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:39,109
ecosystem to make maintainer life easier

00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:44,989
a very concrete example of that is some

00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:47,459
are say help to define you know baseline

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:49,009
responsible reporting guidelines you

00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:51,299
know in terms of you know how you should

00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:53,299
let people report security

00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:56,039
vulnerabilities to your project he

00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:57,359
participated and to find that through

00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,119
the packaged maintenance working group

00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,700
which is a great step he then leveraged

00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,339
that to a PR we have in a proposal going

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,049
through at the open J's foundation as a

00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,779
set of minimal requirements that we'd

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,179
like all of the projects who join the

00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:14,219
foundation to meet so again you know

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,739
having you know it's not necessarily a

00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:18,299
super high bar but starting with a bar

00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:20,579
that says you know all the projects and

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,679
the foundation will at least have you

00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,599
know a way you can report these in a way

00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,320
you know disclose them and so forth so I

00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:31,709
think that there's just so many areas of

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,629
security that are very specialized that

00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:35,249
if we can bring together the companies

00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:37,649
and the people who are experts in that

00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:39,149
to figure out how to help the rest of

00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:41,249
the ecosystem that that's still a really

00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:43,409
good role and so it's figuring out how

00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:45,479
you know we move from what made sense

00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:47,789
four years ago to what makes sense today

00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:49,769
is and I know there's the ongoing

00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:51,659
discussions there but it's good to chat

00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:56,309
about it make people aware but that a

00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,509
bit more true yeah and it's really good

00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,909
you're entering that because I think

00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,469
maybe kind of like a hidden value in

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,969
that work of like having that kind of

00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:05,820
policy for the further like broader

00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:07,079
foundation project is it's a group it's

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,609
a good reference right like if I'm

00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,739
building a you know a new project and

00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:13,469
you know I I want to see what you know

00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,849
what other fellows are doing you know in

00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:16,950
this you know in this space like we know

00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:18,719
what kind you know if I want to see what

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,729
kind of like testing tooling they have

00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:22,229
or like what kind of you know other

00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,550
projects references you know I'd go to

00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:24,590
the

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,810
and and look at her package.json how do

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,250
they set it out what's kind of like what

00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of like dependencies they use and

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,790
so on but then if I have the same

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,500
question for security I can also see the

00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,540
same thing right I can see what kind of

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,250
security guidelines did they embrace you

00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,230
like maybe I want to be like up to par

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,390
in like the same the same bar of quality

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,760
and I think that's kind of like maybe a

00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,250
another reference that we could that we

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,620
could give a community as well yeah

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,270
certainly making the foundation the sort

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,730
of source of thought leadership on that

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:57,670
front and good examples I think is you

00:33:52,730 --> 00:34:00,950
know a good thing to work on definitely

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,600
so when we talked about you know the

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,190
open jazz foundation for a bit you know

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,290
how do you how with how its

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,570
establishment also I think impacts to

00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,220
working group in this sense it's you

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,190
know more project to work with and so on

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:17,390
I think maybe the refocusing as well

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:19,669
touches on that how do you think that

00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,020
the greater node community itself can

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,270
help the security working group end the

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,310
project maybe the node project itself

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,230
what do you think should be done there

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,210
Easter like some activities or some some

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:36,970
volunteer work we could specifically

00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:41,000
call out from one from my perspective

00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:44,270
you know I'd really like to see you know

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,540
any of the companies who have a security

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:49,730
focus security background come together

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,970
you know and discuss under the the sort

00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,610
of foundation umbrella what we can do to

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,500
help maintain errs and help the

00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,680
ecosystem sort of raise the bar even

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,360
just a little bit incrementally I don't

00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,340
think I have any of the answers like I'm

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:08,540
not in in in in that specific like I'm

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,820
not in a company that's trying to you

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,860
know help build the the ecosystem

00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:15,620
security level but I think you know if

00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,030
we can bring enough people together from

00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:22,220
the different organizations who are

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:24,470
focused on that it's kind of helping to

00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,650
figure out the incremental steps we can

00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,960
take you know like the the baseline

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,460
security you know responsible security

00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,440
reporting guidelines what would be the

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,080
next step after that right and then help

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,480
to put those into place

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:45,590
also there's one big part of web

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,350
security and I know that node is not

00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:51,290
only the web but it's one of the main

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,510
use age of node.js that is often for

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:56,420
good and people talk about venerable

00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:02,260
modules what best practice writing

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:05,500
modules but at the end of the day the

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,870
payload weathers the hacking money

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:17,500
happens is often in secret injections

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:22,160
XSS and safe code evaluation and that's

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,960
that's where I think I want to see the

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,560
node.js project I'm the node community

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,110
go to is we've got huge companies and

00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,270
small companies they all have no J's in

00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,490
production with web applications they

00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,130
all have the same issue how do I do

00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:40,280
authentication who do i sanitized input

00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,370
how do I make sure that the things that

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:47,030
goes to my database is trusted and trust

00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:50,960
him or what can we do in the framework

00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:54,890
in the runtime in the ecosystem to

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,700
reduce the mistake area from everyone

00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:02,420
can we make the use of the modules safer

00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,820
by default but not only can we can we

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,310
have dev shakeups people telling me hey

00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,420
what do I do for not in production just

00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:10,550
plug that you will they get

00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,420
observability and the behavior of the

00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,190
users and that's how you will get an

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,530
overview of what's happening in the app

00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:22,820
and that's a part that is actually not

00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:25,430
explored a lot for instance there has

00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:30,560
been a lot of discussions about Cisco

00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:32,450
policies around OGS and Dino and they

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,390
are great because I prevent a process

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:38,150
from doing something unexpected but what

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:40,550
is worst is when a process is doing a

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,860
Cisco it's a load to containing a

00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:46,850
malicious payload and in that direction

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:49,849
I think as a community we we can do

00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:52,910
something as the Java world did that one

00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:55,940
and try to move forward into making

00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:59,930
everyone's application and business is

00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,979
safer it's the the thing that came to

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,660
mind a little bit when you're talking

00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:05,089
about that it's like some of our

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,400
challenges like the JavaScript ecosystem

00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:10,609
is great because we have so many choices

00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,130
on NPM but it also becomes a challenge

00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:15,380
because there's so many different places

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,319
that we could have security

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,269
vulnerabilities introduced right and at

00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:23,959
some point you know it could make sense

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:25,969
to have some common components you know

00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:28,609
one step is to try and encourage say

00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:31,999
some projects to join the open J's

00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:36,369
Foundation which are you know gonna

00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:38,539
provide help provide you know security

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:41,180
qualities of service what you're talking

00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:43,369
about and or you know considering

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:47,119
whether and there's always discussions

00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:49,789
around you know small core non small

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,349
core you know in some of the discussions

00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:53,089
we had at the recent collaborator summit

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,130
around you know what's important to make

00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:57,440
note successful for the next 10 years we

00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,819
started to get into a discussion of you

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,799
know maybe something like a standard

00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:03,279
library makes sense where it's not part

00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:07,640
of core but so anyway just you know

00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:10,549
thinking of ways where the surface that

00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,940
we need to make sure is is secure is

00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:16,519
reduced might be another sort of Avenue

00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:19,069
to think about in terms of you know for

00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,229
sequel injection what are the typical

00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:24,170
ways that that gets through and is there

00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:26,329
any library that could be you know under

00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,369
the the open days foundation or in the

00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:29,900
standard library or in some way where

00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,630
it's you know we have a little bit less

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,059
of a surface for the tasks that we have

00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,469
to try and make secure well of course

00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,029
balancing the you know the great

00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:40,219
innovation that we get from the large

00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:41,630
ecosystem and trying things out I don't

00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:43,069
know what the right answer is on that

00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,829
but like you know making some progress

00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:49,969
on that is probably going to help to at

00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:54,019
least we have an exciting future next 10

00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:56,599
years with no J's right I was gonna say

00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:58,819
that's a lot of food for thought from

00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,709
both of you and that's though alright

00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:02,690
let's go back there are some questions

00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:05,250
that we've got from

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,520
and by the way thank you all for sending

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:11,190
us these questions so uh let's start

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,840
with one of them so one is I wonder if

00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,360
some of security issues are being

00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,640
replicated over and over and could be

00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,070
caught with a pattern search that could

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:27,990
be ran to catch it before it becomes a

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:32,790
bug it's an interesting one so there's

00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:36,570
actually tools for static analysis of

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:40,670
code and for certain kind of

00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:44,330
vulnerabilities they work somehow well

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:47,550
like detecting that you are coding

00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,770
database cool and detecting that there

00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,250
have been a string concatenation before

00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:57,450
from RAC yes that works for them the

00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,480
issue with that javascript is the most

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,790
dynamic language in the moistures

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,860
language in the world and there is so

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:07,230
much that static analysis can do there

00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,510
will be I've gotta say I always say that

00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,460
funny but if there is something weird

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:14,240
that can be done in JavaScript it will

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,220
be done and it might even get popular

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,550
and that's the thing with JavaScript you

00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,870
never know if static instrumentation

00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,240
will do the trick

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:28,170
it will save you 80 percent of the time

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:31,110
so it probably wolf scanning will get

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:34,590
object world for that but there will

00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:36,960
always be this 20% whilst in more in

00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:42,360
less dynamic language it's more true

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,220
person situation I still think 80% if

00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,220
you catch 80% of them that'd be a big

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,330
win so yeah yeah for a low effort it's

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,000
kind of like you know what I'm eating

00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:55,740
all of this that's it's gonna be a good

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,360
8020 I I do know that that I haven't had

00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,010
a lot of experience but I have had some

00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,690
experience where we were in the code

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,180
scanning tools and the challenge was

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:06,090
always there was lots and lots of false

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,620
positives so it wasn't like you know the

00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,040
linter you put in your pre-commit hook

00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,570
and it tells you and you just update and

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,820
my experience at least well i don't know

00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:16,450
if that's changed is that the the static

00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,329
an allows analysis off

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,760
took a fair amount of work after the

00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:24,599
fact to understand that was a really a

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,369
vulnerability or not and and so forth

00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,520
that's very true and that's also my

00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:35,260
experience with most that you can resist

00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:37,990
you know in JavaScript so far okay so

00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:44,920
yeah is gonna be about study code

00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:46,329
analysis and linters for sure certainly

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,829
we want to get to the point you know

00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:50,349
it's like how do we get to the point

00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:51,820
like the linters where I don't know I

00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:56,050
run the linter tells me to do something

00:42:51,820 --> 00:43:00,220
I just do it right got the same thing

00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,480
with security side it would be great so

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,329
you do what the machine says right

00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,530
Michael that's like okay if we've agreed

00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:07,839
that you know we're gonna have

00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:12,520
semicolons here it's like yep I'll do

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:14,890
that oh yeah I could expand that if i

00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:18,930
hack into my coworkers enjoy I can get

00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:21,910
them deliver me coffee at my desk right

00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:24,160
like this well I guess I didn't mean I

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,349
do what it I'd changed the code to do

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,619
what it told me but yeah okay I've gotta

00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:32,260
be a bit careful

00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:34,569
all right cool next up is a question how

00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,369
to secure JSON data transmissions

00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:38,369
because everyone can see it

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:46,420
you wanna want to take that one is that

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,520
is that basically talking about SSL or

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,960
we we're gonna go that way

00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,339
that's what jumps into my mind anyway

00:43:49,960 --> 00:44:00,280
wait I think that the answer it's HTTPS

00:43:54,339 --> 00:44:01,349
mm-hmm so basically of basically you

00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,380
want to encrypt

00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:08,099
communication and you don't want to

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,650
obfuscate anything because security

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,319
through obscurity actually doesn't work

00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,829
at all but you want to encrypt the data

00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:22,240
set to make sure that only the issuer

00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:29,000
and the the Intendant consumer can know

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,920
what's inside it and and avoid unsafe

00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,010
safe the encryption Louisville officer

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,770
so and really I think the trend is to

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:39,440
just turn on HTTPS for everything right

00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,690
I mean I think the standard and and

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,690
things that I see are pushing you more

00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:47,390
and more towards you just have

00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,490
everything HTTPS and if you get an HTTP

00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,860
request you just redirect to that right

00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:55,160
yeah it's a basically an elk us today

00:44:51,860 --> 00:45:00,830
right especially since you have things

00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:02,810
like let's encrypt or even hosting

00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:05,300
providers attend all that I mean if you

00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,970
put your code I think on a Roku it's SSL

00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,040
it takes it appears by and you don't

00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:13,130
even have to pay for your certificate as

00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,130
it was the case like six years ago I

00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:23,060
think I've read that Firefox is trying

00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:26,960
to slowly by default disable HTTPS part

00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:30,590
one point have HTTP and safe HTTP as

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,270
shamed as some old technologies that

00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,250
might have been used to make games and I

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,890
won't name because I'd not I'm not a

00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,820
mean person I mean like hashing

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:43,790
passwords with md5 it's that bad I was

00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,340
talking about such flash players you

00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,020
don't see in every year and it's like

00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,820
okay well there must be a way to get

00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,320
past this but you got to work harder so

00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,850
yeah I think it's just we're being

00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,040
pushed or nudged and maybe I should say

00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,360
nudged in that direction and let's

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,240
encrypt you mentioned this yeah that

00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,770
that's actually you know I think they've

00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,270
done it it's it's great that you can get

00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,950
certificates for free and they've got a

00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,410
fair amount of the plumbing I know I set

00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,210
up an engine X server I can't even

00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,660
remember how long ago now and it just

00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,830
must be rotating the certificates for me

00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:18,200
and so I haven't really had to think

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:19,850
about it since so yeah sure so I mean

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,590
it's we're kinda like summarizing here

00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,950
so I think if you TPS is kind of like a

00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:27,200
by default thing if you go to the HTTP

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,810
archive that's just a cart org you can

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,510
see they're running a lot of like over

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:35,180
over time kind of like reports so you

00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,920
can see the adoption of HTTPS generally

00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,810
you know around the web I mean that's

00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,410
really interesting to see has some like

00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,079
J's related metrics and performance so

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,609
this is definitely

00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:51,140
gonna be I guess our conclusion here

00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:53,819
just HTTP by default so next question is

00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:57,119
recently looking over the application

00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:59,640
pencil Vitry made with electron a site

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,920
sketch a program would be good to have a

00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,299
best practice module for designing a

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,819
site with security at the top of the key

00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:11,279
so I'm wondering if I like phrasing what

00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,930
this is trying to say is I think it's

00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:14,130
kind of like what we touch before with

00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,839
you know Michael and what emerges you're

00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,789
both saying you know we should have like

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:21,359
I like a best practices reference like a

00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:23,849
security guide this even sounds to me a

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,959
bit maybe like like the OWASP s-- go

00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:27,209
it's project you know like those

00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:28,979
vulnerable by default kind of project

00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:31,469
where someone would want to see you know

00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,849
world like but maybe maybe from like not

00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:34,200
the vulnerable by default but is secure

00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,390
by default right they want to see where

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,150
the or the guidelines to follow is that

00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,170
what you make of it that's what it

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,609
sounds like yeah

00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:50,059
okay it's a good project idea if someone

00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:54,509
wants to walk it off I think it's

00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:57,479
potential standard library that might

00:47:54,509 --> 00:48:01,769
happen where okay you're also safe

00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:03,900
bricks to build your applications right

00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:05,729
the challenge I think and why there

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,670
isn't already an easy one we can just

00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:11,039
point to is that there's lots when we

00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,049
say an application there's lots of

00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,209
variation right so in this case it

00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:16,949
mentions like you know electron so maybe

00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:18,359
there's one of those for electron but

00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:23,130
then there's probably also one with

00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:24,539
building you know general web you know

00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,739
see law is building something with

00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:33,690
express you know using graph QL there's

00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:35,130
probably you know you know a bunch of

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:37,199
different examples that that's I guess

00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:39,329
another area I think you know maybe we

00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,999
can think about how the foundation can

00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:44,819
help is like how do you find those

00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:47,039
things right like if they exist all

00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:49,650
right out out there how do we you know

00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,239
and I'm so I'm I'm in JavaScript I'm

00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,069
doing something I'm security conscious

00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,199
so I know that I should be looking out

00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:56,720
for certain things how do I find those

00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,040
right like

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,160
you know and what should though that

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,600
list be even you know so that that's

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,800
something that I think that you know

00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,690
group of people who are interested that

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,280
that it always comes down to like the

00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,970
foundation doesn't do anything out on

00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,290
its own

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,210
right it's not that the foundation has a

00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,820
huge staff of people who were gonna go

00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:17,100
out and write these things it's that it

00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:20,850
can be the focal point and provide

00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,980
resources like you know repose and you

00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:26,820
know use of slacks and videos and stuff

00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:29,010
like this so you know it's for you know

00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,870
if we can have people who are passionate

00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,640
providing the place for they can where

00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,770
they can come together and you know

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,450
collate some of this information work on

00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:40,040
this information or at least just call

00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:43,170
it that it's missing in in areas stuff

00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:45,300
you know maybe ala a small plug is I

00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,100
maintain historical or some node

00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,930
security it's kind of just curated kind

00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:53,220
of like links so you know if you want to

00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,300
swing that around toward a foundational

00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,310
thing if we want to take ownership

00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,840
versus if someone wants to just update

00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,990
it and send a pull request to a project

00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,720
you know of that can help it others you

00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:05,280
know just go ahead and do that yeah

00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,130
that's exactly the kind of thing like if

00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,290
it if there were new people wanting to

00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,270
get involved and having it in a sort of

00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:15,210
neutral location made sense and would

00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:17,340
grow contributions that would make total

00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,690
sense if it's just gonna be continued

00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,550
with you doing all the work that you

00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:24,360
know where it is maybe makes total sense

00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:25,920
as well yeah no I don't want to us do

00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:30,480
that all the work myself so if someone

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,310
wants to I about that definitely so more

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,830
questions let's see we have something on

00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:38,130
malicious modules are malicious modules

00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:41,730
as common as they used to be I feel like

00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:44,130
I haven't heard of many lately what do

00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:48,480
you think what is lately I'm feeling

00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:50,040
like I should knock on wood because I

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,600
don't want one to come up next week you

00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,670
didn't want to say no there's no new

00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,190
mojo so yeah that's right

00:50:53,670 --> 00:51:05,120
seems seems dangerous you know I try not

00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:09,960
to be superstitious but I say that here

00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:11,819
we just they're just not new I mean

00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,130
if I took for instance but prototype

00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:18,210
pollution was brand-new three years ago

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:21,089
and now it's come on thinning JavaScript

00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,800
at large and I wonder if this is more

00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:27,390
like malicious like modules by

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:31,200
definition and yeah yeah I think stories

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:34,619
about that now marry shoes module are

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,540
just something part of the landscape you

00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:38,220
see what I mean we we learn to live with

00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,910
them and they don't make the headlines

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:46,290
anymore but I think they are still here

00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:51,150
but also they went to other ecosystems

00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:54,059
like there have been a photo pie-pie the

00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,940
type of question nightmares yeah great

00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:59,420
domain they all have the same

00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:01,849
compromised modules or type of squatted

00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,859
yeah that's true

00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:06,540
hopefully it's you know a little bit

00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,220
more of a challenging environment for

00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:12,200
them because the you know there has been

00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:15,839
the awareness and you know the the

00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,690
infrastructure like NPM yeah it to a PHA

00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:21,930
but you know an NPM is more on alert for

00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,490
them and so I have some hope that you

00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,200
know like like vladimir said they're

00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,089
they're still going to be there but that

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,770
it's a more challenging environment for

00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:32,099
them than it potentially was at one

00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:36,630
point and end users as well are more

00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:38,460
aware that you know you need to you know

00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:41,819
understand the software that you're

00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,950
using and put into production it kind of

00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:46,440
fits into the larger sort of OSS

00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,559
challenges of you know not only do you

00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:52,490
need to be aware of it from the security

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:54,990
standpoint but you don't trust maybe

00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:57,180
that's from the trust side but also from

00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:59,400
the if you want it to be if you're a

00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,770
critically dependent on it and you want

00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,510
it to be there tomorrow so it may not be

00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,790
a security vulnerability but if it just

00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,770
ages poorly that can be just as big a

00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,630
business risk to you as security

00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,400
vulnerability but you know one of the

00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,609
best ways is to have the people from

00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,960
your company involved in those projects

00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:18,900
and that way you know that what you're

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:21,869
installing is is something that is both

00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,760
safe and is doing the the right things

00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:26,010
on the security front to keep it safe

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,780
as well as you know being properly

00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,740
maintained in all the other dimensions

00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:34,200
as well yeah and there's a comment here

00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:36,060
in the chat that kind of related to that

00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,520
with malicious modules and that is how

00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:40,170
to use forensics to also kind of like

00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,970
differentiate between malicious and

00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,730
unintended bugs which is you know I

00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:46,020
guess another problem of static analysis

00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,100
right like understanding what is the

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,940
context of or the intention here of a

00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:54,360
problematic code from a security

00:53:50,940 --> 00:54:03,150
perspective that some things that she

00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:05,370
had already easy but when you've got a

00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,320
PR coming from someone when you never

00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:09,120
know as a Geetha back home that has been

00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,260
inactive for six years or that's

00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:16,170
brand-new and the croud introduced a

00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,220
vulnerability even if that's hidden in a

00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:22,650
big thing might be malicious if there

00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:27,330
have been a publish on NPM that has not

00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:30,420
been pre faced by commits on github and

00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:37,020
you've got like your incoherent activity

00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:40,710
between NPM and and and github then you

00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:43,440
can expect malicious when it's a long

00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,870
time maintainer of a package that got

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,930
popular that had been maintained for two

00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:58,470
years it's real easy to assume best

00:54:48,930 --> 00:55:01,020
intention almost wrapping up so I'd say

00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:03,210
if there's any other questions coming

00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,410
over to the to the chat or submitting

00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:08,910
the form maybe send them off now and

00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,920
maybe before we kind of wrap up Michael

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,670
if I mean do you want to add anything uh

00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:20,790
as an open item here already like

00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:25,410
fatigue skull fatigue from my cutting

00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:27,690
with me I think go ahead no no go ahead

00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:30,660
I was about to say I mean I think you

00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,520
should answer first okay I was just

00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,070
gonna say that like my only my only

00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,700
thoughts or thoughts moving forward is

00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,829
is

00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,349
I still don't quite think we have it

00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:43,430
figured out you know how we bring the

00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:46,140
right people get the right critical mass

00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:49,170
security is obviously an important topic

00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:53,460
for all of the ecosystem for the users

00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:55,740
the maintainer z' and i'm still just

00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,230
want us to figure out how we we under

00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,060
the umbrella of the open jeaious

00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:03,359
foundation or the node project you know

00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:05,369
have a very sort of vibrant and active

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,099
community who are coming together to

00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:09,420
work on the problems together and I

00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,710
don't think we've quite figured that one

00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,540
out so I'm still trying to think of

00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,800
different you know different ways that

00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,329
we can do that I fit that you know it

00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,970
fits right into the discussion we've had

00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:20,310
about like how do we refocus the the

00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,500
working group I've got a proposal on

00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,540
collaboration spaces at under the open

00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,119
J's foundation to provide a venue for

00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,310
people to come together and and sort of

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,079
collaborate on topics but it really all

00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:34,109
depends on getting you know the the

00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,880
passionate and interested people to come

00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:38,040
out and participate and so for me that's

00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,020
you know on this front that's still one

00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,319
of the areas for us to think about and

00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,450
and figure out how we get that that work

00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:47,069
all going and I know as volunteers it's

00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:52,349
really hard but that's one of the things

00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:56,460
top of my mind agree yeah I definitely

00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:57,810
