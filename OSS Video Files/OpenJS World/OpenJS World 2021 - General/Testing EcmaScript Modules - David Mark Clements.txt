Description: 
	Browsers and Node.js have gone through an evolution with regard to their module systems. In Node we're in the middle of a transition between CommonJS Modules (CJS), the original Node module system, and EcmaScript Modules (ESM), the TC39 specification for a JavaScript module system. As it stands, ESM is something of a black box and this can make testing a challenge. In this talk, David Mark Clements explains the testing strategy and supporting libraries he developed for testing ESM implementations, particular when it comes to mocking ESM dependencies.
