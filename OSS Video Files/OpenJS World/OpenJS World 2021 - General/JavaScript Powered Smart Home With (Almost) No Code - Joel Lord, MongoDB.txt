Title: JavaScript Powered Smart Home With (Almost) No Code - Joel Lord, MongoDB
Publication date: 2021-05-31
Playlist: OpenJS World 2021 - General
Description: 
	Smart things around the house are nice, but let’s face it, most of these devices are rather dumb. An application can typically control the machines, but they can’t make decisions independently. To do so, you need to add some sensors and find a way to have your controllers communicate with each other. To manage all the information coming from these sensors, you will need an application, and this is where Node-RED comes into play. This low-code programming tool lets the user build flows for event-driven applications. It makes it easy to process events, manipulate data and trigger other events. Once all of the flows are detailed, the runtime can be deployed locally or in the cloud quickly with a container. In this presentation, the attendees will see how to use Node-RED and low-code technology to make smart devices smarter with additional sensors.

hello everyone and welcome to my

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,920
presentation

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,560
javascript powered smart home with

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,960
almost

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,400
no code so today i'm going to talk a lot

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,599
about iot devices

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
i'm going to talk a little bit about

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,759
code but mostly i'm going to talk about

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
how you can

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,520
avoid doing code not that as software

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
developers that's actually what we

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
usually want to do we usually like to

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
write some code

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
but sometimes there are shortcuts that

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,000
are really nice to use so let's start by

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,480
talking a little bit about iot devices

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,080
and why should we care about them i mean

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,719
sure we've all heard about different

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
internet connected things but i don't

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
know if you've ever realized the amount

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
of iot devices that are available out

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
there

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,559
it is actually expected by 2025 there

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
will be 75 billion devices

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
that will be working and will be

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
connected to the internet

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
that is a lot of devices and i was

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
looking at that graph and i was thinking

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,559
how is that even possible so i charted

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
with the world population try to see

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
if the world population followed the

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
same trend and and not at all i mean

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it's just that we tend to have more and

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
more devices

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
as a matter of fact i i looked at the

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,880
number of current devices which is

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,960
around 50

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,479
billions and divided that by their

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,240
current world population

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,320
and that gave me something like six

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
devices per person

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,960
like there's no way i have six connected

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
devices in my home

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
so i started thinking a little bit okay

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
well first of all i

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
i've got i've got two laptops we've got

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
a laptop for the family

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
my wife has her own laptop so that's

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
four connected devices

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
uh of course we each have our our cell

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
phones um and

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,920
this is you know a household of two uh

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
we each have a tablet now

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
some people might argue that those are

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,280
not iot devices they're connected to the

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
web but they're not iot

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
things per se so i started thinking okay

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
well do i have any

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,479
connected devices well i i certainly

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
have a thermostat

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,880
um oh right i've got my smoke detectors

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
so i've got two of them

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
i've got oh i've got a smart tv which is

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
also connected on the internet i've got

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,920
well i've got some smart bulbs

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
which i'll get back to that they're not

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
that great i've got some connected plugs

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
i've got three of them i actually use

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
them to turn on and off my christmas

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
lights and various things outside and

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,360
i've got connected speakers so my

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
speakers are connected to the internet

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
so that they can

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,160
stream music and all right my home

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
assistants i've got a bunch of those

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,239
around the house

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,080
and so i've got three of them my door

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,200
locks i've got yeah front door and back

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
door they both have

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
smart locks in there and and and i have

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
a vacuum an internet connected vacuum

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
because

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,280
well you know everybody wants to start

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
the vacuum when they're not at home so

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,720
i started counting at that and that's

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
like um 18

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,640
devices that's nine per person so i

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
guess for someone who thought i didn't

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
have

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
that many i still do have a lot of them

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
so iot devices why should

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
you care well probably because they're

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
all over the place and and you probably

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
have a bunch of them at home and in your

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
professional career

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,000
there's a fairly good chance that at

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
some point you'll actually have to deal

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
with some iot

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,040
devices so this is what i'm going to

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,760
talk about today so hi my name is joel i

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,200
work as a developer advocate for mongodb

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
if you ever want to get in touch with me

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
twitter is always always always the best

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
way

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
so joel underscore underscore there's

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
200 scores there

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,080
so joel underscore underscore lord is

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,440
the way to reach me um

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
you know just to talk about anything

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,879
whether it's databases

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
um connected devices or just to say hi

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
if you've enjoyed this presentation feel

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,000
free to tweet i always appreciate a

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,920
twitter notification so

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
before we get started and before we jump

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,440
into our actual topic

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,680
i just wanted to let you know and and

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,760
just to take a second to talk about this

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
i'm a hacker i i like to tinker with

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
stuff i have a bunch of little

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
connected sensors and various micro

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
microprocessors that i

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,599
i just enjoyed that type of stuff but

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
i've never worked on a professional

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
project with them so whatever i'm going

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
to say here those are my opinion

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,400
um i mean there's definitely probably

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,360
most likely better ways to do things

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
than what i'm going to

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
introduce but if you want to hack around

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,799
and play around i think that

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
um there's a lot of the content that

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,920
you'll find here that can actually

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
be interesting speaking of content this

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,400
is what i'm going to cover today so i'm

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
going to talk about

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,239
iot and javascript so how can we use

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,280
javascript to

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,160
build iot stuff and connect devices to

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,479
the world

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
so we're going to look at the at that

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,040
typically we've always

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
we tend to think about c plus to build

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
embedded stuff but it turns out that you

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
can actually do pretty a lot of

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
cool stuff with javascript i'm going to

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,400
talk about localed interfaces as well

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,600
low code is kind of a trending thing we

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
see more and more of those

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
interfaces where you don't actually need

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,800
to code

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
and finally i'm going to introduce you

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
to iot and low code so

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
i'm going to show you how i've managed

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,560
to solve a few of my problems around

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,759
my home by using both some iot devices

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,600
and some local interface

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,600
so iot and javascript just like pb and j

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,759
as i mentioned already we don't always

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,720
think of javascript as the main language

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
to program

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
various devices that will connect to the

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,919
internet we tend to think of c

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,080
plus plus typically but it turns out

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,080
that you can do a lot of things

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,080
as a matter of fact just a few years ago

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,639
i was at a presentation where i had the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,479
privilege of presenting this tiny robot

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,840
that was controlled by a kinect sensor

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,759
that you can see right there it

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
gets my skeleton and i can do gestures

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
and and the robot would fly off

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,000
so i was able to do all of that using

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
javascript

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
so all the the kinect sensor the

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,479
detection of gestures

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
the actual little robot there everything

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,199
in there is all built with

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,639
javascript let's see that again

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
there it goes okay so getting started

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
how do you

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
get started and start programming

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
different devices using javascript well

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
i'm going to talk about

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,800
mainly two different devices that you

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
can use for iot to get

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
to get started at the esprino and the

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
raspberry pi

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
the esprino is this tiny little device

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,319
right there that you can see

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,160
it's based on the arduino open hardware

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
a few years back we talked a lot about

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
the arduino

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
there were ways to use the arduino with

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
javascript but that wasn't really easy

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
the esprino really you can use

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
javascript out of the box on the

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,520
micro controller it uses the esp82

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,319
chip that is a programmable micro

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,520
controller

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,479
that also has a wi-fi connection on it

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,800
so this tiny devices goes for about 35

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
canadian dollars i think at the moment

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,720
so you get them for pretty cheap and you

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
can do some really powerful stuff with

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,520
that

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
so the esprino wi-fi is the one that

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
i've just shown you is a tiny usb and

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
wi-fi enabled microcontroller that can

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,720
be programmed in javascript

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
so just plug it into your computer and

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
get started in seconds with the web id

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,240
no software installation needed so

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
that's from the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
esprino website you can find out more

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
information there and that's actually

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,880
one of the places where you can actually

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
get your devices

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
so this is what the ide looks like so

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
you can actually there's a website you

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
can just go to that website and then in

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
theory you should be able to connect to

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,560
your sensor

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
now this one is running inside my

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,639
presentation so inside and iframes

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
so it gets a little bit tricky but i

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,639
actually have the um

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,720
the ide right here right in the back

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
there it is and i've got this little

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,440
code that will just blink a lead i've

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
got a little tiny microcontroller right

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
here

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
that you can see let me just make that a

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,319
little bit bigger so you've got the

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,800
microcontroller here

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
so what i can do from this ui i can

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,000
actually connect i can connect to

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,720
my esprino board there we've got it i'm

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
missing a semicolon here thank you id

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
and now i can flash my device now that i

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,199
flash the device

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,360
in just a few seconds you should see the

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
led starting to blink

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,479
pretty cool isn't it yeah so there it is

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
and

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,479
then we also have the status so you can

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
see that right there in the ide

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,000
the status being updated on whether the

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,919
press d led is on or off

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
so that's a very tiny little example

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
that's kind of the hello world of

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
iot devices um of course i wanted to

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
build some things a little bit more

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
complex and

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
we've got here um i i you might have

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
noticed that i i do have something

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
connected to it which is this tiny

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,960
sensor right here it's a temperature

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
sensor and if i just go ahead and

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,720
um of course i won't write all of the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,440
code for it but i'll just copy and paste

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
this code

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
right here and i can flash my device

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
again

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
so next time that it starts it will

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,320
actually have that code on it

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
and what this will do is that it will

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,360
actually connect to my wi-fi

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,039
and it will um now you have my wi-fi

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
password there it is

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,080
and and it will start making a call to a

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,360
a

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
ui so to a url so this url right here

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,560
and i'll get back to that in just a few

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
minutes so now what it's doing is that

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
it's actually

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
just getting the temperature and

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,959
humidity levels and just sense that

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,440
over the wi-fi connection

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
all right so let's take a look at the

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
original code that i've shown you so

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
this is the blank so the hello world of

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,399
iot devices

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,320
is always a blinking led usually there's

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
a led available on board that you can

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,279
use

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,120
that is true for most little micro per

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
micro controllers that you have access

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,279
to

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,800
as well as the raspberry pi's or some

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,240
versions of

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
so the other microcontroller that you

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
can use is the raspberry pi and i

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,720
actually have

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
one right here i'm not sure if it will

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
let me just disconnect now i want

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
disconnected because

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
it does take a few minutes to reboot but

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,000
this is actually

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
the actual picture of my raspberry pi so

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
that's the raspberry pi 4 which was just

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
released recently

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,000
and raspberry pi's are actually a tiny

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
dual display desktop computer and robot

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,160
brains smart home hub

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
media center network ai core factory

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
controller

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,959
and much more so that's also from the

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,959
raspberry pi website but basically what

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,680
the raspberry pi is is that it's

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,360
a tiny computer on a board um and it's

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,120
it's tiny it's about this this big uh

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
you know it's it's very very small

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
and it's very powerful that that little

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,399
uh device has eight gigabyte of rams

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,880
um it has like a hard drive that you can

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,839
add

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,399
afterwards it uses an sd card for that

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
so

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
it's a tiny computer that you can use

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
and it has a bunch of little pins that

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,800
you can use and connect devices on them

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
or sensors or different things so in the

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
case of my tiny device here i've

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
actually plugged a led on it

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
and um and and let's actually take a

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,120
look at some of the code

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,720
so in order to be able to oh and another

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,920
interesting thing and let me actually

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,640
show you the ui very quickly um so this

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,440
is my raspberry pi and it's connected

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
right now

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,600
and you can see that it's it's it's a

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
computer it runs linux it runs a version

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,360
of debian

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
and it actually has node.js

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
pre-installed on it

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
it actually has a bunch of little tools

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
that you can use but you can see here

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,440
that i have a terminal window

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
and i can actually use it to do some

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
different things like i can

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,519
edit some code this is my blinking code

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
i'll come back to the actual code in

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,000
here

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,079
in just a few minutes but then i can

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,720
actually run this code and run this

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,320
oops not this one but i can run my

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
node.js application

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
and it will just start blinking my lead

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,839
pretty much similar to

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,839
what i did with the esprino as well

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,760
so in order to be able to program on

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
your raspberry pi you will need two

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
libraries you'll need

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,760
johnny five um you actually don't need

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,640
but it

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
does make your life a lot easier and

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,640
raspy io

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,320
or raspi io that will be used to control

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,240
the different pins on your raspberry pi

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
the code that i've just shown you in my

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
in my terminal was exactly this code

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
so first of all you require the john

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
five library required eras by

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
and then you just initialize a new board

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
now it's an event trend

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,440
event driven uh type of programming so

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
you'll have events like board on ready

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
this tells you that the board is

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,279
initialized and ready to use

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,800
and once it's ready i can initialize or

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,440
declare a new led

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,120
so by using the pin number then i can

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,160
use the method blink and it will just

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,000
start blinking my lid

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
all right so what should you use an

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,399
esprino or raspberry pi

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
well they're both pretty cool actually

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
they're both pretty amazing little

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
devices

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
but they do have some very different use

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
cases

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,560
the esprino is great for being tiny tiny

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,320
tiny and just i can just easily connect

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
a little sensor on it and there you go i

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
can just put that

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
i can connect the battery on it and just

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
throw it somewhere and forget about it

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,360
and it just works and it's

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
very very power efficient so i can just

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,320
forget about

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
it the raspberry pi on the other hand

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
not as

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
energy efficient it's actually a full

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,320
computer

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
if you need to access it well you'll

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
need to connect a you know a keyboard on

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
it then

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,639
you'll need to connect the display on it

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
but it can be very useful if you want to

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
build a media center then you can

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
actually use that raspberry pi and then

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
you can use those external pins for

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
additional sensors or to you know add

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,320
different

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,000
little things to it so it really depends

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
on your use cases

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
but you know both of them can be very

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
useful

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,440
all right so i've talked about iot

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
devices now let's talk about the low

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
code movement

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,880
what is exactly is low code or sometimes

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,959
called no code

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
well local development platform provides

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,399
a development environment used to create

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,480
application software

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,320
through graphical user interface instead

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,600
of traditional hand-coded computer

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,399
programming

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,639
a local platform may produce entirely

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,079
operational applications or require

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,120
additional coding for specific

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
situations

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
enabling accelerated delivery of

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,760
business applications

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
all right so why should we care right

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,639
we're software developers

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
we know how to code so why should we

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,120
care about low code interfaces

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,880
well there's there's a few good reasons

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,720
for that mainly you don't

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
want everybody to rely on you as a

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
software developer all the time right so

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
sometimes you can use local interfaces

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,959
to make it easier for for other people

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,720
in your team that are not

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,560
as technical savvy to be able to

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
contribute to your project

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,160
so you using a local interface you can

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,839
give access to

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,279
some sort of reporting tool to your

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
managers and then they'll be able to

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
just you know add new sources of

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
incoming data and then they'll be able

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
to

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,560
generate new charts and stuff so local

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
interfaces can be very very useful for

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,240
that type of thing

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,320
but it can also be really helpful when

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,279
you're building iot

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
iot ecosystems and and you you need

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,880
different interface and you don't want

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
to

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,560
build everything from scratch every time

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
so there's a lot of tooling that you can

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
actually use to help you

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
with that i'm going to talk about two

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,440
here there's a lot more

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,639
um ifttt is a product that is available

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,959
really made for makers it's really

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,959
really simple to use and i'm going to

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,480
talk about node-red which is a project

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,720
that i've recently discovered

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
and i think it's an amazing product and

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,120
definitely worth

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,199
talking about so ifttt helps

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
all of your apps and helps all of your

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,880
apps and devices work better together

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,600
it makes it easy to build applets

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,240
connecting various services

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
so you can find out more information on

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,560
ifttt.com

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
but what does it mean well basically

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,720
you've got if this

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
then that so that's the ifttt so you can

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,040
just create

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
connect a bunch of different services so

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,920
you can say things like well if

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,399
i've got a new follower on twitter then

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,240
start

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,519
vacuuming so and and that's actually uh

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,399
that's actually running on

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,839
on my ifttt account so you know if you

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
want to follow me on twitter you'll help

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,440
me to

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,880
have a clean floor because it'll start

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,800
my robot

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,240
but most of the time it's actually a fun

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,680
thing so i just know that i have a new

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
follower when the vacuum starts

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
so you can see the type of services that

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
then there's a lot of different services

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
that you can connect to

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,160
and you can see how you can just

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,199
integrate each one of them together

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,480
and create some of those flows

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,160
the other one that i wanted to talk

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
about and actually just before i leave

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,000
let me just

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,120
switch back here not here

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,279
but i actually had my little

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,279
tiny little device here which is

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,199
probably still running

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,279
i don't have any oh yep yet i just saw

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,600
that link so in in a minute it will do

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,759
another readout on my temperature sensor

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
and it's actually connected to ifttt as

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,639
well

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,320
and i forgot to put it so let me just

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,040
push this window right here

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,560
and every time that it gets a new event

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,079
every time it detects a new temperature

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,240
so every minute or so

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,920
it actually inputs a new data a new row

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
in here so i can actually see that the

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,440
temperature right now is

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,970
27 degrees it's a little bit hot here

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
today that's celsius

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,839
[Laughter]

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,240
and 45 humidity and if we wait and if i

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,920
just

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
you know talk a little bit a little more

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
and i'm not sure what i'm going to say

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,600
but

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
in just a few minutes you should see

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
another row being added

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,560
because it'll do another um another

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,920
reading

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,600
every minute should we wait there it is

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,800
coming meh let's just leave it there

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
i'll put it in the background so we

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,839
might be able to see it

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
in just a few seconds all right so let's

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,640
talk about no

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
red no red is a programming tool for

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,280
wiring together hardware

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,480
devices apis and online services in new

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
and interesting ways

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,280
it provides a browser-based editor that

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
makes it easy to wire together flows

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,600
using a wide range of nodes

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
in the palette that can be deployed in a

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,000
runtime

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,080
in a single click all right nodered.org

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,520
you'll find more information there by

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,120
the way

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
i was very excited but i didn't want to

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,880
start reading but you saw that i got a

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,919
new reading while i was reading

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,880
this this little presentation here okay

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,400
so back to my presentation note red how

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,760
can you get started with node red well

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
if you have docker installed it's

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,919
actually very easy you just run this

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
command

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,640
and you're good to go so it starts a web

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
server on port 1880

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,840
and it will have node red installed and

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,080
ready to be

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,240
used so what is node-red well this is

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,480
the ui so if you are running and i'm

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,080
actually running it in docker right now

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,799
and so you can see that i have it on

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,559
localhost 1880

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
what can we do with that well there's a

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
lot of things that we can do so first of

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
all let's start with the basic hello

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
world type of thing so we can inject

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,240
something

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,559
i'll try to make this a little bit

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,120
bigger so there you go um and then i'm

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840
gonna use a debug statement so a little

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
bit like uh

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
you know when we do console logs when

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
we're trying to do some javascript

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,799
programming

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
we want to see what's going on we can

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,760
use the debug right here so we've got

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
those two nodes

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,799
i can link them together and let's

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,960
actually change

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,120
here so we won't send a timestamp we'll

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,440
actually send a json object

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,360
we can use the visual editor so say i'm

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,240
not you know very familiar with

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,520
json or javascript programming so i can

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,320
say okay well we'll send

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:57,520
a a message and the message will be

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,280
hello world there you go

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,080
so i'm going to send a message hello

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,799
world and in here i'm going to debug

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
the payload so i've got my debugger up

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,080
and running so

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,760
right here you should see messages let's

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,200
deploy this application

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,600
there it is missing twitter credentials

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
ignore that for late for now but we can

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
see that whenever i

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
trigger this this little node here so i

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
can click on the button

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,600
and we get the message hello world being

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,799
displayed

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,720
pretty cool isn't it well okay well

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,000
maybe it's not that cool but

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,240
but there's a lot of things that we can

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
do with that we could say well okay

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,640
let's change this and say

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
um we will trigger hello and and we'll

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,520
add another field so let's

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
use the visual editor again because i

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
think it's pretty cool actually let's

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
just use the

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,880
json and uh we'll you know person

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,440
will be joel uh so now we can send this

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
object

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,520
and we can still trigger it let's just

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
deploy this again we can trigger it and

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,240
we get this new

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
json object so you can see that there's

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,640
a little bit more information in it

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,760
so that's good so far but we can add a

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
switch

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,600
and now with my switch statement i can

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,840
connect this to my switch

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,280
and i can say well if it's equal to jaw

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,039
you know output to node 1 and

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,159
anything else so if it's different from

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,840
joel do something else

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,200
and let's not use message.payload but

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,600
message.payload.person right here

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,039
okay so now this should be triggered

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,159
let's remove

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,120
this link here i'll add my debugger at

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
the end

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,120
and in another case we will

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
create a function

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,799
and let's open this we will change the

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,799
message we'll say message.payload

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,480
equals message

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,559
you are not dull okay

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,480
so i've got this new payload and now i'm

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,039
going to output this as well

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
to the same node right here so if the

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,080
person is dual it's going to output

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,840
directly the exact

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,280
payload and if it's not then i'm gonna

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,720
output some other message so let's

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,400
deploy this application

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
there it is let's click on this hello

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
world this worked

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,360
let's actually change the name of the

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,799
person to um

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,200
someone else someone else

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,120
there you go redeploy the application

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
and boom you are not dual so there you

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
go so you can

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,320
start to create those those more complex

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,640
flows and you can start to add some

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,000
conditional statements and so on

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
another interesting thing that you can

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,159
do is that you can actually go to manage

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
palette here and you can search for

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,480
different things so say you want to

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
connect to

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,559
twitter well you can actually go to

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,760
twitter and add the

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,000
node-red twitter node

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,440
so that's a node that enables you to

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,880
talk to twitter

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
as you've seen i already have it

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
installed but my credentials are not

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,919
valid here if you want to connect to a

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,039
mongodb database well you can use the

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,360
the one right here which is installed

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,960
and it's a node to communicate with a

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
 database which is

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
pretty interesting as well so we can

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,799
actually go in here

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,200
and i don't know if you you know if you

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,520
want to give access to someone to your

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,640
application or to build applications and

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,240
you want to show them how to uh

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
or you need to show them how to connect

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
to a database i mean that that can be

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,679
complicated what i'm going to do here is

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,159
i'm going to add a

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
insert operation on my database

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,679
which is already configured

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,320
in the collection flow data so there it

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,280
is

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,880
and now uh whatever is the payload of my

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
message i'm actually going to

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
just send the payload directly into my

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,360
database and that should add a new

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
statement to my database so let's deploy

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
this

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,919
we can see that we're connected and now

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,320
if i trigger this this whole

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,960
flow we can see that it worked and if i

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
show you

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,080
i actually have an interface to manage

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,440
my um

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,000
 database right here and we we can

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,000
see that

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,080
uh you know we've just got our pay that

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,120
was added right here as a message person

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,679
someone else

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,080
as i just typed and if i change the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,760
inject here to actually say hello to

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,120
joel instead there you go redeploy this

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
application

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,720
retrigger this application and we should

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,880
be able to see a

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
new entry right there a hello world

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,799
person

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
tool cool so you can start programming

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
your

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
your applications and and maybe you

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,000
start to see where this can get really

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
really powerful so it's

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,200
really easy to integrate a lot of

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
different services together

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,799
into this this application so i'm

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,960
already able to you know

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,640
add some information into a database do

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,279
some conditional statements

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,640
and all of that in just a few minutes on

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:47,360
on a graphical interface

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
all right but um the whole thing the

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,120
whole goal and one of the things that

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,200
really led me to this presentation was

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,320
i have some smart devices in my network

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,320
but they're not really that smart

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,159
i've already hinted at my smart bulbs

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,080
and there's a few cases so i i

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,200
wanted i wondered if i could make things

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,159
a little bit smarter

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,440
by using those technologies so you know

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
some of the problems that i have the

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
thermostat temperature is kind of

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,919
inconsistent

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
well not that it's inconsistent but it's

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
in the middle of the hallway

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,799
and when we sleep at night well you know

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
i like to keep the temperature a little

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,880
bit lower but i want to measure the

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
temperature

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,400
in the room not in the middle of the

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,960
hallway my

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
my smart bulbs they're great um but i

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
actually have to open up my phone and

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
press on

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,480
on or off which is kind of annoying i'd

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
rather have a switch in that case

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,000
i managed to connect it to my home

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,799
assistants which this definitely makes

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
it easier

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,799
but you know what if we could make that

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,039
a little bit smarter

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,559
my air exchanger i've got this big huge

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,960
devices device that

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,480
uh exchanged the air but it's a stupid

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,919
device actually there's a switch that i

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,120
need to flick to on

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,720
or high you know or off so not that

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,840
great so i wondered if i could make that

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
a little bit smarter

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
and of course my plans they're not

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,279
connected to the internet so i figured

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
what if i could actually do that

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
well let's go back to our node-red

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
interface here

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,679
so first of all for my thermostat what i

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
what i did here is that

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,320
i actually have exactly this type of

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,480
device so i've got my esp or my esprino

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,080
connected to a temperature sensor and it

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,320
just sends the temperature

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,480
every minute or so to my temperature

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,679
sensor or to my uh to my node right here

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
so that's an http

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
it creates an http endpoint that i can

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
actually ping

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
and then i'll check for the hour so it's

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,559
if it's you know during night time

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,480
um then it will actually move on or

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,400
check the time and if it's not during

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,559
night time it just ignore ignores

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,000
the the request but if it is it will

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
check the current temperature

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,240
and based on the temperature that the

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,039
sensor picked up it'll either turn on or

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
off

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,679
so it'll set the value one or zero and

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,799
then it will send an outgoing request to

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,559
another web service

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,720
and of course i want to save that into

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,159
my database as well

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,320
so you can see that i've just created

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
this whole flow and now thanks to this

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
tiny little device that was programmed

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
in javascript

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,760
and this little flow that i've just

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
shown you i can now control the

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,200
temperature based on

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,720
uh depending on the time of the day and

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,279
i can actually pick up the temperature

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,799
in my

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,640
room instead for my lights um well

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,640
i i didn't really care about turning

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
them on or off what i wanted really was

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,760
to and their exterior lights

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,840
so i wanted to base that on the sunset

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
so i've added this little note here sun

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,799
event inject

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
and this actually happens whenever

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,799
there's a sunset it

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,480
deploys or it triggers this event i wait

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,400
for an hour because i want about an hour

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,559
after sunset where it's really dark

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,559
then turn on the lights and i use this

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,000
trigger node here which will

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,080
which is really cool it'll actually

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,120
trigger something and then it will wait

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,039
for four hours

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,400
and then it will trigger another event

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,000
so the first time it has a one the

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,760
second time it has a zero

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,320
and then i'm able to send an http

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,520
request to my service that controls my

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,240
lights

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,919
using ifttt and it will turn it on or

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
off based on the value that i've just

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,480
sent it

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
of course same thing also save that into

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
my database so i can actually see what

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,960
was happened

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,480
it helps me to debug when i see or

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
noticed that oh the lights didn't turn

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,960
on yesterday

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,400
or things like that my air exchanger so

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,799
i added a tiny little

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,480
um relay on it so i'm actually able to

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,880
turn it on or off now

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,240
and now i use an interval so every every

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,039
hour i started for

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
about 20 20 minutes i do that only

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,600
during daytime so i don't want to do it

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
at night because it's

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,080
kind of noisy so i do my check time as

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,320
well it's similar to what i did earlier

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
i triggered for 20 minutes and i just

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,159
sent the http request to

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,480
my little relay that i have plugged on

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,520
my device

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,799
now if i have a or not if but i do have

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,399
a little

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,399
air quality sensor as well that i have

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
in my kitchen so if i burn something the

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,960
theory is that but that never happens

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,399
right so but if i do the theory is that

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,039
it will actually send a request right

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,080
here

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,399
um to this bad air url and

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,240
that will actually trigger another 20

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,600
minute of my air exchanger so it will

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,080
automatically clean the air

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,440
in my kitchen and what else do i have

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
well of course my plants

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,520
i wanted to know when to water my plants

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,080
so i've added a little hydrometer that i

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,799
put in

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
with a nesprino um i i changed the range

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,480
so it sends me a value from

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,399
0 to a thousand and twenty four or

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,440
twenty three i change that from

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,000
zero to one hundred and they then based

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,760
on

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
uh the critical amount of water that it

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,399
needs whether it's under

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,679
25 or under ten percent it'll actually

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,320
either send me an email

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,159
or send me a tweet because i you know

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,600
i'm more often on twitter than i am on

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,679
my emails

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
so it actually sends me a tweet when

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,799
it's it gets critical

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,279
and then i save this event to my

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,000
database again so you can see how i can

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,840
connect all those

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,080
different services i can send emails

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,679
connect to twitter and there's a lot a

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,399
lot lot different things that you can do

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,880
with node

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,600
node red and that's just you know a

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,480
little

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,080
preview of what it can do so iot and

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,520
javascript can you use iot with

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,120
javascript or javascript with iot

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
devices well turns out that you can it

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,559
actually works out

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,000
really really well it's nice because i

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,440
don't have to learn a new language i

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,760
don't have to learn anything new

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
i can just use my current knowledge and

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,559
immediately start programming iot

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,120
devices

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,919
local interfaces really fun for a lot of

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,600
different things

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,200
if you want to you know make it a little

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,080
bit easier for different people to be

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,919
able to

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,600
add and contribute to your projects then

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,360
that's definitely a good way to go

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,799
but it's actually a lot easier as well

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,440
than to have to program

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,039
all of it so iot and low code they go

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
well together especially that this one

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,440
is really event-based so it waits for

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,840
incoming http requests and things it

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,960
just works so well with the whole

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,440
iot ecosystem so this is what i had for

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,279
today

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,120
so thank you very much for attending

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,720
this was my talk javascript power smart

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
home with almost no code

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
there's a little bit but not too much

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,919
thank you very much for being here and

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,399
if you want more information easy url to

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,320
slash js no code and you can find me on

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,960
