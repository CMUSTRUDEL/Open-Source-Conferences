Description: 
	Recently, the visual programming tool, Node-RED has been used in factories to control industrial hardware based on the sensor and image data. Because non-IT engineers can easily develop their original programs without coding, the Node-RED has become crucial to make factories modern. To adopt Node-RED to the real factories in the closed network, Hitachi encountered issues to place servers and update software components because almost JavaScript technologies tend to require the online environment to download the components from the Internet. To solve the problem, they have utilized Electron to create a single package that includes all components related to Node-RED. Furthermore, based on their experiences using Electron, they started the "Node-RED installer" project under the OpenJS Foundation. In this presentation, he explains the project and demonstration in factory use cases.
