Description: 
	The Open Source software community has inspired a legion of users and developers that have taken the idea to incredible heights. That's not entirely unique to Open Source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups, user groups and even entire conferences. What can we learn from this community? By now, most of the IT community has read the “Accelerate State of DevOps” report from DORA and Google. It reveals data and benchmarks about the performance for which all companies aspire to achieve. For example, elite performers are 1.75x more likely to make extensive use of Open Source Software and are 1.5x more likely to be expanding their use of Open Source Software. But how do we get to high performance? In this talk, I will share how Open Source is the key to unlocking high performance using DORA metrics as a roadmap to achievement. I will share steps in a process such as the adoption of continuous improvement programs, identification of unique constraints, and discovering where you can swarm resources to solve the most critical challenges first.
