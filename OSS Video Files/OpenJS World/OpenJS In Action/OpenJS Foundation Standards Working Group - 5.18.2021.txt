today

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
uh well other than our program committee

uh group of speakers so check them out

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,159
openjsworld.com super proud of that

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,280
program committee

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,360
great plus one um

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,640
cool uh and then i don't i think that's

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
it for uh openjs um

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
meetings this week i think it's kind of

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
a a light meeting we do have the open

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
the program committee meeting on on

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,800
thursday

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
but we're really getting down to the

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,040
last few days

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,440
videos are due really soon for the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
speakers and

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
you know looks sheepishly away not at

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
joel joe because we

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,519
still have to do our video uh so

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
anyway uh looking forward to seeing

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,480
folks there um

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,120
and i think that's it for announcements

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,720
cool um now moving into our agenda

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,519
um the ad hoc meeting that

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
is the first agenda item um issue number

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,440
or 137 ad hoc meeting spec ed community

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,040
group discussion with marcos

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,080
caceres that was on april 28th

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,239
i believe i reported on it last last

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,120
meeting to a smaller group

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,480
but this is a this includes more people

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
i think than last time so it's worth

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,560
going over it again

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,440
the community group is a

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
sort of a subset of folks who are also

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,360
interested

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,040
in just spec production at the w3c

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,239
and what they are hoping to do is create

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,760
a thank you lunch they're

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,799
looking to create a space to mentor and

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,879
grow people into spec

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
editors and help them teach the you know

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,959
help them learn the craft

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,480
we've been working on this adjacently

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,599
in our issue 130 around

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,519
education and onboarding resources so

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
there's a lot of opportunity for

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
collaboration

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
and so i want to highlight that to folks

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,159
who are interested

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,959
in this space that the spec ed cg

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,000
was clarified on that call not to be w3c

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
specific

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
um so if there are things that

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
that are even javascript specific or

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,560
some other web

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
spec specific that doesn't fall under

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
the w3c purview

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
but you think it's worth affiliating

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
this is kind of meant to be a space for

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
for that collaboration on those

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
resources

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
so they want to do tutorials um

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
workshops

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
and stuff and obviously to get started

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,639
there they've got

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
w3c experts so it's sort of w3c specific

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,520
but

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
at the moment but they'd like to expand

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
it so

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,000
um i could see a lot of opportunity for

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
us to help

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
here but that's sort of the that's the

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
highlight

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,600
and um jordan had some great concerns

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,120
and questions last time i think we got

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,280
those largely addressed um

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
ben and jamaan yeah yeah i don't think

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,919
y'all were able to make it last time

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
you know any any questions or ideas or

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
anything there

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
cool yeah not necessarily at the moment

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
just uh

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,600
seeing it really for the first time so

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
it looks really like an exciting

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
opportunity

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
yeah so the other thing that was shared

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,280
was that he wants to

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,840
build a website um a landing page

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,039
which could be something that we link to

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,720
from

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,320
our curated list of resources

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,080
uh too so i see this is good and

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
additive it's just more people kind of

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
trying to

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,919
focus um on the problem so

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
many hands make light work

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,160
right in theory cool

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
so i think that's it for this issue and

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
i will

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
um go ahead and remove the agenda label

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,520
from

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,560
this issue because i don't

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080
i don't see that there is another

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,080
there's any need to keep it on here for

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
now

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,919
and i'll probably close it uh

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
but oh and the recordings on that if you

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,000
wanted to go back and listen to

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,840
uh the discussion

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,680
cool right close issue

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,520
all right um

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,240
the next topic for today

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
is actually i'll skip to the discussion

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
request

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,360
because it's so closely related

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
standards slash education onboarding

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,000
resources this is issue number 130.

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
and here we've started to collect a lot

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
of things from

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,680
folks we know from us we had a great

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,000
chat last week about actually

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
creating a new repo for this migrating

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,479
this issue over

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
and starting to collect two two lists

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,599
one is the list of resources that we've

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
already started on this issue

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,280
the second is a list of questions that

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,840
we hope to

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
answer for people arriving at such a

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,759
site

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,479
like oh you know i have a question about

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
how do i read the spec here here's a

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,199
list of resources that help you

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
learn different specifications that

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,120
action

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,919
item was on me my mother-in-law has been

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,280
in town

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,720
i've been behind so i uh

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,360
i'm sad to say that i didn't do that

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,000
yet but the action still stands um

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,919
we have our web designer at the lf ready

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
to start building out the page so i'm

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,800
happy to help crank out that

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
page content structure you know if you

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
know i just want to

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,960
offload you know i'll work on it offline

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,919
uh that'd be great um because we don't

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
want to

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
block and we'd love to kind of have this

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
to share as part of

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,720
uh openjs world that's a place to

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,759
highlight

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,919
um even if it's mvp right like this can

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,639
be something that's relatively

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
um light for now i thought we had a

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,479
really productive working session with

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,199
you all last time so i think we're

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,360
in a pretty good spot to get something

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
up

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,720
um so i guess one question to the group

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
since we are going to have a little bit

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,160
of time today do we want to spend

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,280
another few minutes talking about what

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,720
some of those

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,360
questions we'd like to answer are

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
there were some great ones last week but

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,240
we've got

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,839
new folks who may have new questions or

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
may have have different

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,640
experience that you know prompted

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,240
different questions getting started

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,760
you know would that be all right

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,760
take a few minutes hypothesizing

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,160
questions

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,600
cool um so we kind of started with

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,320
kind of a couple of generic

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
questions like uh how do i learn to read

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
a spec

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,519
that was one um you know

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,120
where and how do i learn a process so it

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,399
was important for us that this

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,360
particular resource didn't teach

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,480
any specific the tc39 process is well

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,200
documented on tc39s website so let's

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,240
rather than try and replicate that data

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,519
send them to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,519
the canonical source and then

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
there were also some questions around

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
that were a little bit more niche

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,959
but also very important which is you

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,160
know how do i understand

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
sort of the ipr

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,480
questions and issues that an sdo will

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,360
undoubtedly confuse you with

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
those sorts of things those were some of

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
the

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,240
the key ones that i'm remembering off

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,800
the top of my head um

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
but we have those on a hack md i can't

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,600
remember

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,120
um we should have those in our notes

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,279
from notes from last

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,720
meeting um and

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,720
you go see did i add the

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,839
okay that's from last month those are

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,839
notes from last month that doesn't work

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
notes from 420

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,959
uh here we go

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,640
oh i guess i didn't take good notes

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,240
actually i didn't take any notes

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,399
i suck um you don't suck jerry don't say

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
that

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
um no it's funny because i do have like

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
a pr for other notes it's like work in

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
progress because i started taking notes

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
in that meeting and then i have to go

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
re-watch the video so i can finish

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,720
taking notes

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
i took some notes too but it's in

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,279
another binder i'll uh

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,360
pull them yeah let me see if we did

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,120
put them in a hackindy just because it

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,120
feels like something i would have done

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,560
yeah i don't see it my guess is

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
um

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,160
oh or did it not make

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
do you know what i think last week was

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,240
that was one where the agenda issue

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,839
didn't make properly for some reason

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,120
and so i had to make a um temporary file

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,600
so i think i can find this

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
in a minute

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
uh but anyway so while we're while i'm

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,000
looking that up

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,839
um let's let's ask ourselves um

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,399
what other questions we

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,839
would have of um or we think that

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,800
newcomers who might be interested

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,240
in being a spec editor when they grow up

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,600
would have um

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,880
something i was just thinking about i

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,160
have to drop in just a couple minutes

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,440
here but um something i was thinking

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,959
about was uh

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
there's like a serious they're not a

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,560
serious it's just a fact

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,920
but there's uh there's a lack of um

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
video so there's a lot of people who are

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
learning

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
uh via video these days and within this

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,800
space i mean there's

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,079
i mean with a job you know if you're

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
learning javascript there's tons of

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,160
videos if you're learning whatever

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,880
there's tons of videos

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
for understanding how specs work uh

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
these topics

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
uh you know even even the um even the

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
the blogs and the things that were

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
mentioned uh like alan's blog

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,959
uh your blog jewelry other things i mean

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,079
all these would make

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,399
you know wonderful um opportunities to

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,160
be able to turn into something

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
that is uh that's concise and

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,079
approachable uh

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
and you know just like to introduce you

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,240
into the standards process

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
uh via via video and um that's something

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,560
that i would be interested in

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
helping out with um over time uh you

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
know

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
within a the context of a site or

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,800
whatever like intro

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,279
like how do i look at a tc39 spec how do

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
i look at

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,200
ecma 262 how do i look at ecmo 402 what

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
are those things you know like all that

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,240
kind of stuff

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,600
um so just something i'm you know i'm

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,320
thinking about at the moment

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
uh but it might be an opportunity i mean

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
there's mostly just

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
talks um you know like uh on like here's

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,839
how we do ekma

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
you know 402 or you could do like make

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,320
it a series even like

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,639
exactly yeah oh i like that idea

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,639
yeah and i have dnas that are not

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
branded amas anymore

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
yeah totally yeah and i mean it doesn't

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
even have to be like

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
all in one person you know it could be

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
like a a spreadshot like we could

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,000
uh you know each individual could just

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
like take a topic and make a

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,040
you know a video on it and i mean these

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
days like you just record it with your

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
phone

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
or whatever and put a little video

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,800
together would be cool yeah

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,040
those have been easy for us we take the

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,720
videos and we just time stamp them into

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,959
topics and we just do a short little

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
summary a couple of like a blurb

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,040
um and they've been really well received

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
so that's awesome

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
um i i have to drop y'all but i just

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,959
wanted to say hello and

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,279
i'm excited to uh be in the ring with

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,079
you all again

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,199
welcome back yeah i started getting

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,079
involved with uh

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
with node i18n and and the website

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,959
project and things like that

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
and so i'm sort of waiting back into the

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,639
stream and i'd like to it's sort of uh

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
you know i'm in a place where i can

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,839
uh reestablish intent to you know do the

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
liaison work that we talked about before

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,880
with unicode i've been talking already

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
been talking with stephen lewis and

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
people like that so excited to talk

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
about more uh

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,880
about it more with y'all um coming soon

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
and yeah can't wait to see you next time

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,160
i think we have an outstanding blog

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,360
draft we do

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
i think it's going to change a little

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,639
bit since so much time has passed

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
i think instead of like a you know like

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
hey this just happened which is kind of

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,800
the way i was writing it before

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,199
it should be more of a like did you know

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
uh but uh but yes that's that's uh

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,920
definitely an intention of mine okay

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,399
well we're gonna follow up with you on

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
that

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,839
please do yeah i'm excited to uh to get

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
that out there and get people excited

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
about it

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,519
oh really quickly um i think something

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
that's really important to communicate

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,199
that blog

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
is is through that blog is pathways into

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,920
how

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,279
how it works like how we can you know

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
through uh

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,279
through like the problems that users see

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,240
uh you know with using

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,600
uh like the part of the intl uh object

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,360
or whatever like how does that translate

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
into actually like going to people

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
from unicode you know it's like where

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
how does that all correlate what does

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
unicode even mean in the context so

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,120
anyways i'll

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
i'll get back to y'all on that but um

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
awesome yeah all right it's good to see

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,959
you all

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
take care bye um if you have your hand

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,320
up sorry

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,440
yeah no problem like as ben mentioned

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,360
about

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,800
the spectating process and how do you

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
understand i was

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,199
trying to pitch about read spec with us

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,800
to ben i just dropped a link to him

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,639
but the other thought that came into my

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
mind i would like to also hear jordan's

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
opinion on this

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
is uh would it be nice to have some kind

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,639
of a core

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,800
kind of a lab where you could uh take uh

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
a person through a process of uh editing

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
their spec

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,480
uh or probably a repo which says hey

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,720
step one to step zero to step

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
seven like here here are the things they

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,800
there's a spec already or

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
or there is a proposal and how do you

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
how do you make respect for this

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
particular function you can

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
we can make a hello world kind of an

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,720
example and say

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
if you were to translate this to spec or

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,040
respect is getting translated to this

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,079
how would that happen and also kind of

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,120
give a playground where

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,480
folks can go and edit because uh the the

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
we mark down the language is a bit

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
different than what it is and like

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
additions and deletions how it's

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,440
highlighted in respect and

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,880
uh how do you see the existing spec or

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
get the parts of of

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
that and try to enhance the existing

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
spec with uh

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,279
a particular line you want to enhance it

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,519
with your audition from

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,199
from a professor we just made up for

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,079
this exercise would that make sense

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,800
would it make

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,519
easier for folks to understand how to

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,440
edit spec

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,880
and probably you know enhance

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
it's just a thought that came into my

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,120
mind

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
yeah i mean i think there's lots of

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
different things people will want to

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,120
learn

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,280
and what you're describing covers a few

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,880
of them and that sounds great

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,360
um the only like gut reaction i have is

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,799
like

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,640
i want to make sure that we don't do

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,919
anything that

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,120
uh overly indexes on

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
encouraging enthusiasm with in the

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,919
absence of

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
educating about the constraints in other

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,039
words

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,240
uh it like and i've talked about this

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,799
before but if someone is

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
really excited about their language idea

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,960
and they

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,600
rush too far ahead before learning about

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
the constraints that might be relevant

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
uh

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
then they might end up feeling very

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
frustrated and

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,600
also costing the time of those who have

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
to explain to them those constraints

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,679
later

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,039
and uh so if we can find ways to teach

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
them about things

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,880
in which including those constraints

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,320
before they can

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,240
indulge their own enthusiasm then i

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
think that's really successful

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,000
like that would be that would be a great

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,000
thing to do

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,799
i i like that idea and and i agree with

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
jordan that it's sort of

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,440
it feels like because you're kind of

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,559
starting with where you

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,200
the work you've done and hearing ben

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:28,400
um it's like comment your work is like

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,799
step one right and then step two is sort

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
of kind of what ben is saying which is

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,400
everybody learns this information in

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
different ways and

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
some like video and some like your

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,960
podcast format and some like the

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,400
the articles and so being able to say oh

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,039
if you're a

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
if you prefer tutorial videos here's the

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,440
path if you prefer

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,080
you know and then once the

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
the groundwork of now you should

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,640
understand

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,840
the what why how and the why not

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,440
in some cases um here's like a

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,320
hello world version of

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,520
a spec you can play with in order to

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,080
learn web idl

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:15,490
or learn like process or language

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,120
you know things that that feels like a

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,240
[Music]

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,480
good um

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,120
evolution of of education

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
for folks

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,280
yep totally agree this might be

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,360
somewhere down the lane but

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,960
uh just an idea that you know that might

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,039
be useful

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,880
and also probably having a framework

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,799
that gives us clarity on

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,480
uh things that don't mention right like

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,280
few things that you might rush and then

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
you realize hey

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,799
this is this was the constraint that we

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
probably missed or these are the cases

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,360
that we didn't consider

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,039
uh if someone shouldn't reach that

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,400
situation probably we need a frame but

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,000
which says that hey

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,480
these are the fundamental questions that

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,880
you you need to ask yourself before you

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,559
have an idea that might be a proposal

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
right so we don't have such a framework

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,600
and i

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
do understand it's not an easy task to

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
come up with

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
to generalize it or to standardize it

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,080
but

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
i think we could give it a shot and see

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,720
hey these are some of the

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,640
questions that folks have asked

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
themselves when they have

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,320
proposed these and some of them which

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,159
they reached to stage

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
four these were the questions that were

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
asked in the meetings try to

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,600
uh come up with a pattern saying that

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,440
hey these are the these are the thought

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,799
that that needs to go into your mind

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,799
even before you try to

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,200
we can't do like a framework per se

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
because it just wouldn't work but like

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,880
guiding questions you should ask you

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,039
know

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
why hasn't this been done before like is

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,640
there

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you know can you go back and ask if

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
something

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
like this has been proposed in the past

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,400
and why did the committee not take it up

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,159
or whatever

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,159
that would be great like blog content

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,320
too just saying

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,320
so um

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,039
but that and also a great sort of guide

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,320
to

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,799
reference on our on our would be

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,799
website

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,240
um cool i uh need to go

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,880
get a charger because my laptop is about

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,280
to die

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,480
so um come continue to come up with good

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
ideas while i

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
hopefully don't die

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,840
sounds like a life or death situation

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,840
very dramatic i know

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,520
cool you know what i was thinking we

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,559
would do

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,720
we can go through um take a cut

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,480
i think at those questions that we did

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,360
from our last meeting

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,960
and then share the document with uh this

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,480
this group who attended

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,559
and those who attended last time just

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
let you hack away on it and provide

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,400
edits

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,400
um and then we can start building

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,120
always good to have something on paper

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,120
yep

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
sound good

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,480
yep all right back not dead

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
yeah we're just saying maybe we take a

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
stab at

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
the content and the questions and the

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,880
framework of the webpage

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
and then share it back with this group

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,840
and for feedback and then we can start

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,720
moving forward

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,520
that sounds good and we can i mean we

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
have we do have a

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,200
quick and dirty template that we can use

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,880
to

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,760
um get this up um

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
and we may start with that and then yeah

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,640
yeah

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,919
is there anything you were talking about

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,440
being creative on what we're calling it

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,919
does anyone have a creative thought

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,919
are we

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,410
or would we lose people if we get too

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,039
creative standards bonanza

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,000
[Laughter]

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,000
standard landia

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,320
i like bonanza just because wasn't that

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,280
like an old western on tv and like

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,600
it was yeah so you know that's kind of

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,750
funny

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,750
[Music]

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,960
um yeah

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,360
i don't know if we want to get too cute

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
with names

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
i mean i do want to get cute with names

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,679
but like is it a good idea

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,679
descriptive is always good i think we've

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,320
called it internally we've called it a

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
wiki

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
we've called it a resource we've called

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,200
it uh

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:13,679
i don't know standard slice

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:19,120
standards what standard slice

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:22,640
dot slice and then no okay um

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,320
standard dies like the play

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:30,880
dice that we play with just a word fun

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,880
dice like d-i-c b-s-e

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
um

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,440
i mean there's also sort of like this

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,720
educational like

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,200
component so to me i i think of it a bit

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,039
like a library

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,039
and we're sort of librarians

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
so

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,559
it could be a kitchen or a bookshelf

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,760
maybe

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,200
a cookbook um which

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
that was a whole thing for a while

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,080
everybody was making

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,400
you know such and such cookbook

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,159
you know react or angular cookbooks or

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,400
you know

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,400
hmm

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,360
let's call them chapters right

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,520
oh that brian would would would love

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,640
that and so brian

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,760
cardell who's not on the call today um

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,360
used to run a group called chapters

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,640
uh dot io thanks mike champion

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,600
thanks for um and uh it was more of like

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,440
a

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
and he set him up around schools and

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
stuff because it was like

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,440
um you know university students

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,080
to learn about and talk about specs and

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,360
sort of find different opportunities in

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,919
the platform

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,120
um and he he had a pretty active one in

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,240
his hometown

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,480
at least um it's this is sort of an

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
extension i think of what he was trying

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,240
to do

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,240
but but you know it's more online

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,000
my old boss used to describe standards

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
as chapters in a book

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,960
as well so

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,000
the standards library

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,679
what else is curated art

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,220
standards is an art form abstract art

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,840
contemporary art brutalism is what it is

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,840
[Laughter]

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
actually

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,760
yeah um yeah it's a commons

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,760
area that's a good one joe um

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,640
i do like the idea of of it being

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,360
like because comp commons sort of speaks

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
to like

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,039
why we want standards and that's sort of

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,279
a good

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
thing to remind people that's another

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,480
really important

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,600
component to this educational project in

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,039
my mind is like

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,760
reminding folks why standards in general

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,039
but

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,760
but web standards specifically are are

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,760
very important for us to

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,480
create

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,320
and i i think it joe also suggests

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,640
community in the chat i mean

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,520
one concern that i have about using that

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,159
at

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,679
present is just that the resource that

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
we're talking about making at the moment

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,640
is very static

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,080
like like we're not going to be you know

00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,000
able to help the folks who come

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,279
other than to say here here is a list of

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
here's your reading list or your

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,760
watching list or your listening list as

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,840
the case may be

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,159
and do kids still use cliff notes in

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,159
school

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,760
internet it's the same standards for

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,480
dummies you know those like really

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,080
crappy

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
yellow and black books you know they're

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,000
like ah

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,240
well if it's it would be the gallery

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
right

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,559
arc notes cliff's notes you know

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
standards notes

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,240
um is there a group sheets an even older

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
term right

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,760
yeah definitely

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,640
normative references

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,840
so creative

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,880
anything along the javascript landing

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,159
theme

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:59,840
if we kind of stick with that

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,840
concept of one world

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,799
think of it perhaps as like a geographic

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,720
location you know standards country or

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:13,840
something standards

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,840
united nations of web standards

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,919
um that has some other connotations

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,279
depending on you know

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,240
what you're that or iso you know

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,279
kind of like um i don't want to be from

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,840
another planet

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
for sure

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:35,279
did the intergalactic standardization

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
resource list

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,159
that that would be pretty funny

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,159
standards camp

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,520
oh see that would be fun i would that

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,360
would be something i'd sign up

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,450
can i be a camp counselor no

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,760
that would be fun no kids go there

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,039
[Music]

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,520
hitchhiker's guide to standards that's

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,240
fun

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,080
i like that and this is sort of like the

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,120
the babble fish that goes in your ear

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
and like we're gonna help you

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
can you do a sofa we could go also old

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
school

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,960
like they would have like the the daily

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,600
readers

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,440
books right that kids would have like so

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
it's like your standards reader

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
um the sort of reference to all these

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,640
old textbooks that

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,000
used to do yes

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,880
anders digest and

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,279
that's sort of close to to what the

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,919
tc39 educator outreach group was

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,320
working on and they've sort of done

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,600
standards in two minutes which are

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,840
super short explainers

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,919
of very specific things but this

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,880
is a super set of that right where we're

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,799
saying we're gonna

00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:04,159
go more in depth on bigger topics um

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:05,600
but it's closely related

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
i don't know if we're naming is the

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,320
hardest thing

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,159
um it's fun to be clever but even just

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,840
like standards resources

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,279
is really kind of you know straight to

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,799
the point

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,279
descriptive yeah

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,679
no it's harder mascots don't even get me

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,679
started

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,360
what would the mascot be

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,279
that's a great question yeah

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,399
but after 20 years spider monkey got

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,399
their mascot finally

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,039
yeah um i think an alien camp counselor

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,600
would kind of combine some of the

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,600
thoughts here

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,720
with spectacles to be a a librarian

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
yeah yep a stack of books in their arm

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,640
just a really long detailed agenda

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,640
document would be

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,080
does the tcq app have a logo

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,480
it needs one it would be like an

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,399
aardvark or something random like that

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,159
or not praying mantis because brian

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,360
collects has praying man

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:33,679
anti whatever

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,159
well okay naming

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,120
uh in the long tradition of javascript

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,039
we will put off

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,840
until the very last minute and then

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
settle with

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
ecmascript

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,109
[Music]

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,960
it's a shed that's painted several

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,880
colors you know exactly

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,880
a rainbow colored shed to signal

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
that's actually a great idea

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,720
um but in the interim we can at least

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,080
start with

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,200
uh with the draft content and

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,399
um uh design from

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,320
um from the lf team and

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,039
uh that'll get us started so um

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,760
so actions from last week which i will

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,240
uh

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,159
actually do this week is to make a new

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,440
um repository and transfer

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,320
this issue over and we'll continue to

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,679
brainstorm on questions and because we

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,679
want this to be a living thing

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,799
so and keep adding your suggestions

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,840
for um uh

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,399
resources and and questions there and

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,440
we'll we

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,880
will at least get started and see how i

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,039
think another thing is

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,960
with any product product design we want

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,399
to get feedback from people so at least

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,360
launching with something

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,039
small we can start asking folks what

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,679
they'd like to see there what questions

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,120
they'd like

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,120
to see our group answer

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
and that that could get us get us

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,720
started

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,720
so

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:20,560
[Music]

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,040
great um okay so that was that topic and

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,159
then

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,639
the fir the last issue for today was

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:31,919
um issue number

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,040
uh 132 um

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,079
and that we kind of talked about uh

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,560
in in the private session earlier so i

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
think

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,119
we are closed out on agenda items is

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,599
there any other

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,720
business for today any and i should have

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,399
asked this before when

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,639
when ben and mike were on the call but

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,639
and any uh

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,400
any other business to highlight

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:07,040
i have one thing from the w3c um

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,800
if not the um advisory board nominations

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,520
were closed and so there's

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,160
going there's an election that's live

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,119
they've sent

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,480
out some candidate statements and i

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,079
think i shared those with everyone in

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,720
slack i'll re-share them again

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,240
if you have any feelings on how um how

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,160
and whether the

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,599
openjs foundation should vote in that

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,119
election

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,200
please let please let me know

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,200
i think i have a couple weeks before we

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,520
our ballot is due on that

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,960
and there are a few charters that are up

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,160
for review but none of them

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,560
are really pertinent to our group so we

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,839
will

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:49,200
not participate in in those but um

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,200
that's it from the w3c

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,760
oh and i have a meeting with an ab

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,119
member on thursday and i'll learn a

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,119
little bit more about

00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:02,240
their status the legal entity uh

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,520
stuff which is ongoing and tangentially

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,320
related

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,320
to our group so

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,839
all right that's all the business i have

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
i think

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:26,800
