Title: OpenJS In Action: ESRI powering COVID-19 response with open source
Publication date: 2020-10-01
Playlist: OpenJS In Action
Description: 
	In this episode of "OpenJS In Action, we talk to  Kristian Ekenes with Esri, a geographic information systems company. Esri is using predictive models and interactive maps with JavaScript technologies to help the world better understand and respond to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, they have built tools that visualize how social distancing precautions can help reduce cases and the burden on healthcare systems. They have also helped institutions like Johns Hopkins create their own informational maps by providing a template app and resources to extend functionality.

hey

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
i'm robin ginn i'm the executive

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,559
director of the openjs foundation i'm

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,679
coming to you from my home in spokane

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
washington

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,360
um and today i'm really happy to have

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,119
christian econous

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
from esri uh here to talk about how esri

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,600
is using open.js foundation

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,039
projects in their solutions now just

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,519
quickly i have been

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
sort of a fan of esri for some time and

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,399
have been really inspired

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,880
by what they've done in times of like

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,040
global emergencies for example

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,879
hurricanes and things like that

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,719
so it was really cool to see what

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
they're now doing in the time

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,200
of another global emergency which is our

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,280
pandemic of kovid19

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
uh so christian's here to talk more

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,760
about how

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
what they've built has sort of become a

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
global data reference uh tool that many

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
of us rely upon every day

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
so christian why don't you tell us about

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,399
yourself thank you robin

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
i'm christian i'm a product engineer at

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,000
esri

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
i work specifically on the arctis api

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
for javascript because

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
esri builds a number of solutions but i

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,119
work on the website

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
um being a product engineer i'm not

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,680
involved in the

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,439
in the development of the software 100

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,759
of the time though i do do that a little

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,280
bit

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,200
but i work on the qa side documentation

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,680
i blog present and

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
work on all aspects of the product

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
that's very cool

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,000
so tell us more about esri for those who

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,360
haven't been following you so closely

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,600
well esri we are a software company that

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
builds geographic information software

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
and that's that's just a fancy way of

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
saying that we build mapping software

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
and it's not just the maps but it's also

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,079
the data behind the maps we

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
work on the software and the databases

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,159
that

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,600
create store and manipulate the data and

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,000
we also build a variety of uh spatial

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
tools that users can use to analyze

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,640
their spatial data

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
very cool so now tell us specifically

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
what

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,400
esri has done to build a

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,680
data tool for the coronavirus

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,360
so esri's done quite a bit in the

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,280
coronavirus response

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
they've done many tools i've just been a

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,360
small part of that

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,920
but they've been involved in producing

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
dashboards and providing data that's

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,599
authoritative

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,440
curated that will help organizations

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,000
including health and human services

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,560
organizations counties governments

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
hospitals to understand the data and

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
know

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
where the most needs need to be met and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
so

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,080
i work specifically on a web app called

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
capacity analysis that allows

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
some of these organizations to

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,560
understand or

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,959
attempt to predict what the hospital's

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
ability to meet the demands of coba 19

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,280
patients might be

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
in the future great now i mean you all

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
were involved

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
really at an early stage i was reading i

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
think you launched your first public

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,879
dashboard in january so what was the

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,200
process that led your team

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,680
to take on this work well first off um

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
most of what has been launched hasn't

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
actually been esri it's been other

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,360
organizations so johns hopkins dashboard

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
launched very early it was them that

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
built it

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,159
though we provided the the app and the

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,280
building blocks that allowed them to

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,159
build and deploy that so um

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
but yeah we were involved very early in

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
in

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
helping support them in that effort and

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
that kind of just

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
uh steamrolled and and or i guess

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,799
snowballed rather

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,080
into all these other projects yeah it's

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
it's been great to see

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
um i know so many people reference that

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,480
as well so

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
how is building a data reference or a

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
map

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
for kova 19 different than maybe some of

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
the other data visualizations that you

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
all

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,200
have supported well building a map

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,599
for a covet 19 well kova 19

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,360
in general it's been one of those things

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,560
that has alerted everyone

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
into understanding that geography does

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
matter

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,359
in a lot of cases we often look at

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,400
numbers like total cases and

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,560
um you know rates and death rates

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
but those things vary quite a bit

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
geographically it's

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
it's been interesting to see that so

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
when you view that on a map it instantly

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
alerts you into what might be happening

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
with disparities in certain areas like

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
why is there a higher death rate in the

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
northeast

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
than in the southwest and so it allows

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
us to just ask more questions and try to

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,400
find better solutions

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
yeah it's pretty fascinating i've always

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
heard zip code is a great predictor of

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
healthcare

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,199
sometimes so pretty interesting um

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,199
so let's talk about the engineering

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,639
behind it so what factors did you look

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
at when you decided to

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
select the tools that you all did and

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
maybe you can dive a little bit deeper

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
into some of those technologies that you

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
did end up selecting

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
to build that tool so this ultimately

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
started with

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,240
our desktop software arcgis pro they

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
built a couple of spatial analysis tools

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
um

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,800
that were based off of a couple of

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,039
models one is the chime model

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
which was developed by penn medicine and

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,919
another one is the cova 19 surge model

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
so they created these models to help

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,479
customers

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,639
make these predictions as to how the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
number of hospital beds or icu beds

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
would be needed

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
given you know the state of the pandemic

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,919
in a particular county or area

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,639
and where i stepped in was more about

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
how do we display that those results on

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
the web

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,479
in a meaningful way that allows users to

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,960
explore them

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,400
potentially these experts can use it as

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
a way to

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
hand over to the public so they can see

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
for themselves what

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
can happen if we don't follow certain

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,039
regulations or

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,199
or processes to avoid the virus so what

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,759
so what sort of scenarios and variables

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,039
did you look at

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,039
so um i'm not i just want to

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,280
say i'm not an expert on cover 19 i'm

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,759
not a health expert by any means but

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,800
when when it comes to these two models

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
um

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
with chime in particular at social

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
distancing we

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,639
provide there's a parameter in that

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,039
model that's that stipulates

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
what percentage of the population what

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,600
will happen with a certain percentage of

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
the population

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,919
follows a social distancing mandate or

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,680
order or suggestion and then it will

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,319
produce a curve over a certain number of

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
days

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,120
of what that might look like the kobe 19

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,440
search model is a little different it

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,039
it takes a look at closings and

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,000
reopenings and phases

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,120
so if we close down the businesses in

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
the schools

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,520
and workplaces what happens if we

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
reopen in phases versus all at once and

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
so

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
um those are the really the two main

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
scenarios and those have been the hot

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
topics of

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,280
what's really effective and what's not

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,039
yeah so how did the developers then

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,199
translate that into the app so how

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,160
how did you you know what did you use to

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,759
build

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
those uh models so that that was um

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
this was like where the process got

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
really difficult um

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,199
we have a spatial statistics team at

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
esri that actually worked into building

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,039
the models they

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,039
took the math and converted that and

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,599
wrote the code so to speak and

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,000
deployed them as as tools into the

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,120
desktop software so these experts could

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,160
run the outputs on the website it was

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,639
we were involved in helping

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
design what the output service might

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
look like how do we

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,800
structure the data for example do we

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,599
do we place the values of k

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
of hospital beds icu beds in separate

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,360
columns in a database on for separate

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,319
days or do we structured a little

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
differently

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
where it's all available in one column

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
or

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
one day so we can visualize that in an

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,680
easy to

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,120
use way yeah it sounds complex all the

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
taxonomies around that

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
and um one thing i thought was really

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
interesting when i watched your open js

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,000
world session is just

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,479
how it's almost like it looks it looks

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
so easy for us to digest the information

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,840
but obviously

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
you know there was a lot of work behind

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,919
that so

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,080
yeah um so i so talk to me about some of

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,080
the open js foundation projects and what

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,120
you know what role did they play in the

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,560
the

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
development of this solution so we use a

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,720
number of

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,600
of open js projects historically our

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
our javascript api was built using the

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,680
dojo toolkit so that

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
played a very significant historical

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,399
role in our product

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,920
in order to make it um consistent across

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,080
all browsers and platforms um but we've

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
since moved largely away from the dojo

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,880
toolkit we use it

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,680
in configurable solutions for

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,519
internationalization so because we have

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,560
we translate our apps such as capacity

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
analysis

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,000
into more than 30 different languages so

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
we use their

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,519
internationalization there but also just

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,040
in the development process we use

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,440
tools like grunt and eslint and also in

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,240
turn

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,920
for the testing modules oh that's great

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
that's great to hear

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
um so how did those open source tools i

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
mean

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,480
sort of what value did they bring back

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,480
to the to the developers

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
well ultimately i guess the number one

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
thing would be productivity

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
um things like linting and grunt you

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
know

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
those tools really boost a developer's

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,160
productivity

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
and something like intern and testing

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
modules obviously

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
it comes down to the quality of the

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
product too you want to make sure it's

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
properly tested

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
and so that translates into a better

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,000
overall product for the customer

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,720
that's great um so

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
thinking about uh sort of your customers

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
the

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
the folks who are picking up your apis

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,880
and your solutions i mean

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,240
how is what you're building helping them

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,160
well so we are

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
a little unique in the sense that we

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,040
don't only deploy

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,760
apis and sdks but we also provide a

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
number of different apps across what we

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
call

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,440
platforms so it's an arcgis platform

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,079
where

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
they can create a web map on the desktop

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,920
application and share it

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
so that it's viewable on the web or in a

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,200
mobile device

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
and so um

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
i lost my train of thought yeah i was

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
just i was reading about your templates

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,560
and it just sounds like what you

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,640
produce is just so it's it's the ease of

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,360
use it sounds like is what i'm

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
what i've been reading from your your uh

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
case study so

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,320
yeah yeah it does come down to ease of

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,000
use

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,640
um one of the things that we try to

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,160
um champion is configuration over

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
development so if our

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,560
users which a lot of our a good chunk of

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,040
them come from geography backgrounds not

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,440
so much

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,959
programming or developers and so if we

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
can give them solutions that they can

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,160
configure

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,000
that's the number one way to go and then

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
of course we give them the apis

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
that they can extend and build off of

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,560
that when they need to

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
that's great that's great to hear um

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,480
do you have has your team like

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
experience any challenge particular

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
challenges

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,800
and the ongoing development of these

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,000
tools

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,320
oh yes absolutely we

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
i mean we're on a large team i i

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
actually don't know the exact number of

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
who works on

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
the arcgis api for javascript but it

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,279
hovers around 40

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
because some of us are full-time others

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,480
are part-time they work in other

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,920
projects but

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
one of the challenges or probably the

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
largest challenge is just maintaining

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,200
consistency across the api

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,560
once you have too many cooks in the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,839
kitchen i don't want to say too many

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
when you have a lot of cooks in the

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,440
kitchen

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
you can introduce a few inconsistencies

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,320
and

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
and that's a challenge but also this

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
broader platform and ecosystem of

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
products we need to make sure that we're

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
consistent

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,320
and conforming to a common specification

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,480
so our

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
sdks that run on mobile and those that

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
run on the desktop

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,240
are all consistent in how they implement

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,000
the web maps that we develop

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
interesting you're doing are you doing

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,600
this at a global scale you mentioned

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,680
for the covid response

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,760
yes i mean i say that hesitantly because

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
i'm not like the authority on that topic

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
but

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,399
yeah it's it's definitely global in the

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
customers we support i know just from

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
capacity analysis

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
and what i've tracked i don't know how

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,360
many organizations have deployed that

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,639
a version of that app and their own

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,720
organization but

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
i've seen deployments of that app in

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,639
brazil indonesia

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
and other parts of the world also

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,639
counties in the united states so

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
great now i'd like so the capacity i've

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
just in a nutshell just describe that a

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
little more fully i thought it was super

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,519
interesting when i sort of sat and

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,800
watched your your

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,120
uh breakout session so right yeah

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
the capacity analysis app is it's really

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,720
intended to be this

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,800
um solution that helps people understand

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
what would happen given two different

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
scenarios one is

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,160
probably a more aggressive approach to

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
to social distancing or

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
to shutting down versus what would

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,160
happen if we didn't do that

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,880
and the way we the way you might view

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,079
the app is you see two maps side by side

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,720
and then you see a chart that that um

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,240
classic graphic where you see two curves

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
like what happens if

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
if we social distance versus we don't

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
and those are

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
color coded to correspond to these maps

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
and so you can

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,399
actually move this slider along the

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
bottom along these dates for which the

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,959
models run

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,920
and see what would happen in

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,000
on say may 20th if people didn't social

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,120
distance versus if they did or if half

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
of them did

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,399
and what's interesting about that is the

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
chart gives you the overall

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
perspective of you know we might our

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,519
hospitals might be over

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,440
capacity across the board

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,120
but going back to your previous question

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
about why the maps or the geography

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
matters is

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,639
it might just be one spot that's causing

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,519
that and other areas are fine

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,880
so so they can they can explore it that

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,880
way and then they can also choose a

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,199
variable such as

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,639
icu beds versus hospital beds versus

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,360
ventilators

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,880
wow amazing and i know that governments

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
are looking at that data

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,639
for reopening and all kinds of really

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
nuanced

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
guidelines so that's super important so

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
um

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
yeah i mean what you work on again is

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
just so inspiring

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
and you know you may not show up for

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
work every day and go wow but you know

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
when we see it sort of from the outside

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
so

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,040
for us i always like to ask sort of when

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,720
you show up for work and have a great

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,519
day what does that look like

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,639
what's a good day for you today a good

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,360
day at work is

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
it's so different all the time um you

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,240
know

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,920
i would say not very many meetings

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
though i like communicating with people

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
and making sure we're on the same page

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
but

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
um it i have a lot of time to myself to

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,480
help

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,600
to kind of think through the problems

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
and um

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
prototype a lot so i like prototyping

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
and just trying new ideas

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
most of those don't pan out and work but

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,519
it's good to at least try and make sure

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
that

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,959
that you know it doesn't work and we

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,880
don't just wonder what what if

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,279
you know this would have worked so i

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
like testing things out i also

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,040
really like interacting with the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,959
customers and and blogging so it involve

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,240
a good day involves a variety of things

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,639
writing coding prototyping

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
