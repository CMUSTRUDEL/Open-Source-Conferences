	Building Modern Native Add-ons for Node.js in 2021 - Kevin Eady, Hive Streaming & Gabriel Schulhof

Quickly get up to speed developing modern Node.js native addons. This fast-paced talk, presented by members of the Node-API team for all native add-on developers, covers recent enhancements to Node-API. Support for multi-threaded and asynchronous programming in Node-API has been significantly improved. New abstractions such as thread-safe functions and the Addon class greatly simplify the effort needed to implement asynchronous add-ons. New helper methods support date objects, BigInts, retrieving object property names, and detaching ArrayBuffers. Tools used to build and deploy native add-ons also continue to improve. Developers can build with CMake.js in addition to node-gyp. Prebuilding binaries significantly improves the experience of native add-on users. Deployment options permit serving these binaries from GitHub releases or bundling the binaries in the npm module itself.
