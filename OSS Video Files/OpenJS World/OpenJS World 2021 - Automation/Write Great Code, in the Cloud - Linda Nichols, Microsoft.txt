Description: 
	Developers love best practices and have strong opinions about our tools. We’re always improving our processes so we can write the most efficient and maintainable code. Our static code analysis tools are a requirement for development. All of our code is stored in revision control systems and we can’t accept updates that haven’t been unit tested. This is how we write great code. Let’s talk about writing code in a cloud environment. "Serverless" ecosystems can remove the complexity of environments, runtimes, and frameworks. Do our typical development processes change when most of our environment is abstracted away from us? I want to discuss how to maintain best practices in the cloud where there is more management and abstraction. I'll also show some new (and old) tools for development and DevOps to facilitate "serverless" development.
