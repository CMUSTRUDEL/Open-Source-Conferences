	Fighting Covid with Serverless and JavaScript - David Gonzalez, NearForm

At NearForm, we built a number of Covid tracking applications but more important: we also open sourced the core. This source can be found at https://github.com/covidgreen/. In this talk, I will explain what are the major pitfalls we found along the way but also how to operate a planetary scale application with a very reduced team of people and a surprisingly low number of outages. Table of contents: - Introduction - Why Serverless - What were the biggest problems - Recommendations for running large scale geographically dispersed apps
