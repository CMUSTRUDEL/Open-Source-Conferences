Title: Developer Workflow Automation with GitHub Actions (CI CD) - Brian Douglas, GitHub
Publication date: 2021-05-31
Playlist: OpenJS World 2021 - Automation
Description: 
	The goal of DevOps has stayed the same, but our tools, infrastructure, and operating models have changed. To support modern software delivery, itâ€™s critical for organizations to establish and share proven developer workflows. This talk will cover how existing projects are using GitHub Action with the hope that all projects despite their size can benefit collectively from knowledge sharing. The benefit of Actions is that the majority are open source. Plan to this talk leave with ideas on how you can automate new portions of your software development workflow and gain insight from open-source projects by peaking into their actions folder. To name a few, Octokit, Babel, and Next.js.

hey everybody thank you very much for

00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,600
coming to my talk about github actions

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,440
i'm b dougie and i'm going to jump in

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,040
right now so cool so i'm going to jump

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,960
in and talk about github actions

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,120
uh there's going to be a lot of examples

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
uh all the stuff is open source

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,840
so feel free to take a look at the top

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,560
of the slides uh for the urls and the

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,039
slides that have

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
websites associated with them but i'm

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,000
here to talk about github actions

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
if you haven't if you've gotten this far

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you haven't heard of github action

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,359
that's totally fine

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
github action is the way to automate

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
portions of your workflow gives you a

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,480
piece of

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,079
uh github primitives put into one

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
feature inside of your github

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
repositories um so

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
if you have a github repo you have

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
access to github actions

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,239
now github actions is it's the backbone

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
is workflow automation so

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,879
it's a built um built-in feature that

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
connects a bunch of different primitives

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,800
uh at github perimeters being github api

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
authentication web hooks there's all

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
things that you can leverage

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,280
and have access to directly from their

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
repo so

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
i'll go through some examples but before

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
i jump into there i have an analogy i'd

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
love to share

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
or anecdote which is basketball uh

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
the game of basketball it's a sport

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,680
that's played in across the world

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
actually i was going to say us

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
but it's it's all over the world and

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
it's kind of like soccer

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
if you aren't familiar but you use your

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,880
hands instead of your feet

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,119
and um the object of the game is get the

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
ball in the opposing team's hoop

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,640
that's what how you score a basket or a

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
point now there's a concept of full

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
court layups where

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
you have five members on a team and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,119
instead of

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
that person that takes the ball in

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,079
passing it that person this basically

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
scores a point everybody else sort of

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,560
stands around

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
in the context of coding cowboy coding

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
is something that comes up a lot folks

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
who maybe wait for the senior engineer

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,360
or somebody else on the team

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,439
who has more context on the project to

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,799
shoot the ball in the hoop or commit the

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,840
code or review the pr

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
and sometimes it becomes a blocker what

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,799
i like to do is find out the best places

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,479
actually one thing i like to do when i

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
contribute to open source is find out

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,880
the places where i can actually provide

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
value and in the game of basketball

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
there was a book that came out

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
as well as a movement around hoopanomics

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
uh it's when you apply statistics to the

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,200
game of basketball

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
and at this point in the court uh this

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,080
is the half court right here

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
uh at that point 31 of the shots go in

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
uh and are made

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
or that are tempted go inside the the

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
basket the hoop

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
and uh that's hyponomics and the way

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
they did is they basically took all the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,599
shots that happened throughout the

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,959
entire court

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,879
and then they had to find identified

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,560
percentages based on that so

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
this right here you get two points if

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
that goes in the reason for 31 percent

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,120
is because most players are right-handed

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
so

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
at this point of the court you're gonna

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
it's gonna be harder to defend a

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
right-handed shot on that side of the

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
court

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
uh it's actually easier to dribble if

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
you're right-handed to the right side of

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,560
the court as well

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
but there's so many other variables as

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
well but just note that

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
if you know you're going to get all your

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
shots or with 31 percent of your shots

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
that are tempted made there instead of

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
doing a full court layup

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,000
leverage the team passed the ball from

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
the one to the two which one

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,760
correlates with the player on the team

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
so the two

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,599
being our shooting guard um they're

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,800
in position in area 31 to make that

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,480
attempt or that shot

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
and if they missed number three or

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
number four is going to grab the rebound

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
or number two will get

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
rebound so everybody's in a position

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
everybody's doing their job

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,519
and that's what i like about automation

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,560
is like it's not everybody but it's

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
every bot

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,200
uh and we'll get into that in a sec uh i

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
like to actually explain this in ideas

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
uh for automation through repetitive

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
tests there's gonna be stuff that we do

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
all the time every day once a week we're

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
vo pr

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
uh there's all opportunities for

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,560
automation and that's what i love about

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,640
github actions uh because you can

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
actually hook into those web hooks

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
authenticated um interactions through

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
the

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
the github ui and make those automations

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
happen i'll share some examples in a sec

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
but if you haven't got if you got this

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
far and you don't have any actions in

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,040
your repo

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,360
if you just click the tab on your github

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
repository it will give you some actions

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
if you have a node.js app or a

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
javascript app or a deno app or whatever

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
app

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,760
it will just identify that through

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,799
heuristics and also because of file

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,959
extensions

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,480
that you have javascript and it'll

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
recommend some ci

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,239
some npm install some scripts to be able

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
to um

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,160
set up ci actions for you uh right out

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,560
of at the gate

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
they look like this uh it does infer

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,600
like matrixes so if you do have projects

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
that um

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
have different versions of node that are

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
required to be leveraged in the project

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
uh you can leverage the matrix uh you

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
can also run your ci your build

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
your linting all through github actions

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
uh

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,160
it also gives you access to the entire

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,479
node environment too as well so

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
very similar to other ci systems and i

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,320
think i i don't want to spend too much

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
time on

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
the ci side of the house because i want

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,520
to talk about the continuous delivery

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,639
but like with good ci systems they kind

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,800
of just work this

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,720
you set them up you don't have to fix

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,759
and break or fix broken

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,600
ci's all the time it should be like a in

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,039
a place that it works

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
all the time 99 of the time um

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
some examples that i have around

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
continuous delivery is like there's one

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
thing that i do in my projects which is

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
i like to have a lighthouse score for my

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,880
web projects it's something i don't ever

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
think about

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,960
i only run the lighthouse score whenever

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,840
there's a problem or if i have bandwidth

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
to start

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,759
improving accessibility or improving

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
performance it's something i just don't

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
think

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
of uh until again there's a problem the

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
cool thing with the lighthouse action is

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
that

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
it actually gives you a lighthouse score

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
at the time of pr so

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,919
rather than wait for till there's a

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
problem check the lighthouse score every

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
time there's a pr

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
and then we can always work to improve

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
the project success accessibility or the

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,479
progressive web app score and stuff like

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,840
that

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
the other use case i have is my

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,520
storybook my storybook.js i have a

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,919
project called opensource

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,039
and all my components are built using

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,520
storybook or sorry they're

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,080
sort of hosted using storybook it's a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,759
way for me to sort of showcase my design

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
across other folks who contributed a

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,080
project i have a front-end project

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,759
it's called opensauce.pizza and this is

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
my design system and if anybody wants to

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
come

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,720
in and contribute they can see my basic

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
design here

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
and there's opportunity for improvement

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
so people can actually

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,520
kind of jump in there and get an idea of

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
how this looks in the code but also in

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
the ui

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,639
i mentioned this but i work at a company

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
called github you've

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
most likely heard of it i mentioned it

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
quite a bit but collaboration tool

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
uh what we've been doing a great job of

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,680
is collaboration at scale we give access

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,400
to folks

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
repository and code across time zone

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
across computers across whatever

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
how your situation your teams are set up

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,600
we're here to

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
support that uh this is the github

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
homepage just shouting out that this has

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
been updated in

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
the last uh six months and it's got a

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
cool little globe but i also want to

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
point out that

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
that number is outdated it's actually 65

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
million developers worldwide

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
and um i bring that number up because

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
i just mentioned that i'm a developer

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
advocate at github and properly

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
introducing myself my name is brian

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
douglas

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
this is what i look like on the internet

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,560
this is my handles as well

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,479
but the 65 million developers uh helps

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,440
me with this term which is i'm a beyonce

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
advocate which

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
i'm a big beyonce fan and beyonce has a

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,080
lot of fans as well

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,919
and um i like to basically be where the

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
people are just like the little mermaid

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,759
uh i like to hear the questions answer

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
questions you have a question about

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
actions about

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
issue templates about you know all the

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
stuff within your repositories i'm happy

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,599
to field those and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
introduce you to people who can give you

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
answers um

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,199
speaking of beyonce i've got this

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,120
project called the bay bot and uh this

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,000
bay bot is a project i i

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,599
built as a joke last year uh but it's a

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
twitch integration to basically when

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,560
you're live

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
streaming folks can interact with you

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
using this baybot it's built on

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,520
javascript and html and css

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
pretty basic i've also built this other

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
in the bay bot i've also built this as a

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,319
github action as well

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
and it gives me the same sort of

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
interactions but

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
uh instead it's gonna be in your github

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,319
comments uh i built this actually that

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
issue right there

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
uh is accessible you can actually tr

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,599
test out the bay bot yourself

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,800
right there um but it just responds with

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,479
a uh a gift

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
of your choosing so it's not beyonce

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,479
only you can use a uh

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
using to get a giphy api you can present

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
a gif of anything you would like

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,759
but what i'm getting at is like a lot of

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,879
these concepts i'm gonna bring up uh the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
next few slides

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,080
are all open source like feel free to

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
jump in jump out

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
leverage stuff for clone that's the

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,039
beauty of a kit of action so that you

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
can clone and fork

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
and contribute the things that you can

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
start building upon off and

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
that's what i love about this conference

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,640
and i'm super honored to be here again

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
speaking um about something completely

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
different than i spoke about last year

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
but the one thing i want to point out is

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
one thing that i

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
had no concept of or ever tried or

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,959
attempted to do in my projects which is

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,240
generating release notes

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,080
i find this process a little bit

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,680
cumbersome especially as a solo

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,000
maintainer of a project

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
i just don't think about notes and

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
making sure folks are on the same page

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,360
i'm the one that's shooting the the full

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
court layups and

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
using this github action which is called

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
release drafter it actually gives me an

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,880
idea of like the commit from

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,399
this shaw to that shaw and all the

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
commits in between and gives me a

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
beautiful list

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
of commits that i can share for my team

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,279
and it looks like this

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,360
this is my open source releases you can

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
see dependable is a number one

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,160
maintainer on my project

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,480
uh and all the commits that they did in

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
that week uh which is intense depend

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
about you can slide out a bit

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
um they're all listed right there and i

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
can keep track of like okay these are

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,440
the pet about changes but these are all

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,519
the changes

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
from the humans up here and i'm able to

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
organize that through release drafter

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and it's all built on automation

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,440
also shout out to semantic release with

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
github actions it's all based on yaml

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
which i showed

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
earlier but i didn't call out it was

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,160
yaml you could run

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
npm scripts or npx scripts so if you

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
already have a github token and npm

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,839
token you can do your entire automated

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
release with semantic release which is

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,200
a cli tool that you can leverage uh

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,600
inside your action workflows

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,320
so it's not about only using actions but

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,959
it's also being able to have access to

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
uh existing and ready to run node

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,200
environments as well

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
now this is sort of the meat of the

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,279
conversation and sort of how i'm going

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,920
to round up

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
uh this talk is cloud deployments and

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
environment management which just sounds

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,160
like a mouthful but it's kind of the

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
heart of my cd

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
workflow i have a project called slaybot

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
and slaybot

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
it's kind of like baybot but this one

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
slays and that's literally the

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
description that's right there on the

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
right

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,399
uh but it's basically a bay bot but not

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
another level so it

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
integrates github api to be able to

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
whenever someone stars a repo while i'm

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,800
live streaming

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,079
it will show up on screen uh it's like

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,519
sort of like tongue and cheek and a lot

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,640
of the stuff i sort of work on is kind

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
of tongue-in-cheek

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,399
all right so since i have a bit of time

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,760
i'm going to add a little

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
so since i have a bit of time i'm going

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
to show you a really quick demo of what

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,200
slaybot looks like

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,839
uh best thing i could show is going into

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,839
the repo

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
start the repo itself and on the

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,160
above you can see i actually started the

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:15,040
repo the other thing you could do

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:18,000
is you could type in the yo command and

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
beyonce shows up and shows that that i

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,279
am hype

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,120
in the chat this is the sort of sums up

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
the interaction but let's just jump back

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
into the slides um

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
but i do live stream every tuesday and

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
friday on twitch.tv

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,839
i build github actions i build open

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
sauce and i also build a couple other

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,640
things

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,839
and i like to interact with my community

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
and have folks like

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,040
feel like they're on stage with me but

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,760
without needing to be in front of camera

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,560
so with slaybot what i do a lot is on

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,680
stream

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,200
i have to fix stuff for the bot and i

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
also have to set up staging environments

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
too as well so i can

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
test things out so basically you're

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,600
building the ship while you're trying to

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
sail it down the river

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,839
exactly what i'm doing slave bot i've

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
got in my my environments i've got a

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,240
staging environment which i have here

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
you can see

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
on the right and i've got the production

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
deployment um sorry the production

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,880
environment

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
and i won't go into a great detail of

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,839
this and i'll

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
actually zoom in on that but basically

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
github offers an

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,720
ability for you to set up environments

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
in your repositories

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
which makes it easier for the point

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
deployments for github actions

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
it's something we shipped in the last

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
six months so i encourage you to check

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
it out

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,839
i'm able to also highlight in my yaml um

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
the the environment name too as well so

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
i have an environment called staging

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
and i'm also pointing it to this url so

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
i've got a separate staging url that i

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,200
only deploy

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
whenever if you look on line 42 whenever

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
there's a pull request

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,440
i'm only deploying to staging uh that's

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,200
the only time i have an opportunity to

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
deploy a staging it's all automated

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,240
and i can set up approval so that way

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
only one staging

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
is live at a time so that way not to pay

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,760
more money

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,360
for that and then the other thing that i

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
do is i leverage this thing called

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
github script to be able to

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
have a comment directly in my pr on that

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
staging url

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,680
and the way i'm doing that is again with

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,959
github script

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
this is the actual github script that

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,240
i'm using i'm leveraging the github api

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,560
again it's part of the primitives for

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
github actions and i'm able to take that

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
url

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
from azure which uh azure i'll show you

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,880
in a sec but

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
it's a it's an azure action uh web app

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
service that allows me to

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
deploy to azure from github and then

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
return a url

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
take that url and adding it to the

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
comments and that's this is the code

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
that i'm using to

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
have this right it's all open source

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,079
feel free to copy and paste or delete

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
i might not accept your pr if you delete

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,120
it though

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,360
and the other thing i'm doing is i'm

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
uploading artifacts so with

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,399
this might be obvious but maybe

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
depending on

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,440
this might be your first issue or first

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
time you've heard of anything like this

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
before but with azure

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,800
it expects a zip file or a zipped

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
repository to be able to deploy it so

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,240
i'm using

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
this github action which called web app

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,279
deploys it's uh

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
all github actions are they're just

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,600
github repositories you can contribute

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
open issues do it as you would like with

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,240
them

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
and um what's cool about this is with

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
the artifacts i could use a github

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
action to then

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,560
build an artifact which is my my

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,680
repository

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,959
upload it to my pr so basically in my

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,880
actions tab i can upload an artifact

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,360
where i can see and download the zip and

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,279
and whatnot and i'm leveraging this here

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
this is actually my build

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
script or my build job basically

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,519
uh and you look towards the bottom

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
that's where i'm uploading the artifact

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,279
using the

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,600
action slash upload artifact uh v2

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,199
github action i'm naming it node app

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
which if you saw before it's called node

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
app right here

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,040
and then it's just grabbing all that's

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
in the sort of current directory

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,519
and this is my deploy step which i'm

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,519
leveraging again this is for staging

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,959
um but if you scroll down to like well

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
if you look down to line

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,320
7 which i didn't highlight that's where

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,279
i'm getting the web app url from the

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
azure web app

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,760
output and then i'm downloading the

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,320
artifact and then at that point i deploy

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,079
it

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
um so this is this is the the crux of

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,440
how i get my deployments to work while

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,120
i'm live on the air and streaming

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
and it gives me the ability to basically

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
make it a change or a fix or add a

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
feature

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,079
in front of an audience and do some live

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,880
coding and it gives me the ability to do

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,839
that continuous

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,199
delivery continuous deployment so i

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,040
don't have a lot of time to go into

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,560
a lot of details again this is open

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
source definitely check out the

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,279
repository that i shared earlier called

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
slaybot

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,440
i might be the only slave bot on github

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,440
i'm not sure yet um

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,880
automating storybook i wrote a a blog

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
post on dev.2

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,320
about how i do that so again i can't go

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,040
into detail on how this is

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
this all works but i do encourage you to

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
definitely

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,279
check it out um there is my design

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
system too as well if you

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
also want to check it out and contribute

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,440
to it i forgot why i have that slide

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,920
there but

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,120
and then finally the lighthouse action i

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,800
mentioned in passing

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,880
this is my lighthouse score so i'm able

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,120
to see the score in my actions tab

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,639
inside the logs i didn't have time to go

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,079
in the details about the logs because

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
i wanted to focus more on the continuous

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,920
delivery piece of this

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,600
but there i got my logs every time my pr

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
happens i can historically look at the

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,120
context and what's changed

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,800
i can even make this a comment on the pr

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
as well if i wanted to

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
and it gives me everything i need to do

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,399
to basically make this work

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,079
also shout out i didn't mention too as

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,079
well but you could also have

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,120
your urls inside of your workflow

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,600
visualizer which i

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,720
sort of breezed by uh what you're

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
looking at here is the workload

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
visualizer

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,959
you can visualize your workflow and the

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,480
steps as they sort of depend on each

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,480
other

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
i also want to shout out that my github

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,560
profile it's powered by github actions i

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
i intentionally built a myspace clone

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,759
using github actions

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
and to github profile readme so if you

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
want to dig into that repo

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,399
find out how i'm leveraging uh code to

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
power by

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,680
powered by actions to be able to keep my

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,880
my top eight

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,040
up to date uh man i wrapped

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
also shout out to my youtube because you

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,639
know like and subscribe but also i have

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
some github actions tips and tricks as

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,320
well so i've got a playlist there

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,000
if you're interested uh reach out if you

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,839
have questions because i end up making

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
those in the videos because it's easy to

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,679
have that the point

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,880
to the folks in the future also wrote a

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,520
whole blog post on how i built the

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,000
myspace

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
on my github profile using actions check

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
it out

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
uh and again just try actions and i hope

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
you find this insightful

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,720
uh i'll be around the q a q a sessions

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,799
so find me or find the sessions and i'll

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,480
be there to answer questions

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,760
all right thank you very much and this

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
is what i look like on the internet if

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,280
you forgot

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,840
all right have a good night or a good

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
