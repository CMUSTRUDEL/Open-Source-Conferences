00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,160
am the community director

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,000
at the openjs foundation and i'm so

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,200
excited to chat with you today

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,320
alongside my bestie josephi

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,560
hi yeah i'm joseppi uh work for ibm

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,000
as an open source engineer and i also am

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,560
the chairperson of the

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
cross project council at the openjs

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,439
foundation

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,439
we like to use the acronym cpc a lot

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,239
which i think confuses people huh

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
joe it's true it's very true but it

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,719
stands for cross

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,800
project council it does it does and what

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800
is the cross project council

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
uh council which i think is a fun word

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,840
uh but yeah so we're the cross project

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,520
council cross project meaning we

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
we we try to help all the projects in

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
the in the foundation and we have

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,440
different representatives from different

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
uh groups and uh different projects uh

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,359
uh as well as people that are

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,719
outside of the the individual projects

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
as well coming to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,199
help make things better for for everyone

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,920
i like the word counsel as well because

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,119
i think it

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
it encaptures it captures like what the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,080
spirit

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
of the group tries to do which is really

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,360
help like

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
and also provide advice and work

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
collaboratively with

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,560
with projects and with the community and

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,520
with the board too

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
um and you know i think that's a so i

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,799
think council is like also

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,400
like apt description of like

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,439
some of the activity um one thing people

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,479
may not know too is that the the council

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,320
really is

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,479
just you know there for support for the

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,439
projects and stuff but we don't

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,479
dictate technical decisions for any of

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,720
the projects

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,159
nor does the openjs foundation board of

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
directors that we really kind of have

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,840
this

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,159
balance of you know obligations and

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,719
responsibilities

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
where the projects really get to you

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,560
know

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
do what they want to do yeah and i think

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,399
that there's

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
it's a i don't know if freedom is the

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,560
right word it's a freeing kind of thing

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
in that we

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
are really just working to make things

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,560
good for the projects

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,720
and um just trying to improve their

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
the the the resource that they have and

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
and the ways that they can

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
uh support their own communities and and

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,879
be a part of the larger ecosystem

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,160
uh so it's really kind of a good place

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,200
to be where you feel like you're

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
you're doing positive things um

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,480
you mentioned earlier you know that

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,360
we're doing a lot of

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,519
uh programs and things and we'll get

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
into javascript landy and some of the

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
others that

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,319
we're really uh we're working on

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
actively now but

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
um what are some of the things that the

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
cpc

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,319
does that um or that we've been working

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,200
on that that have helped projects

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,160
yeah there there's an assortment of uh

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,599
things that we

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,519
are working on currently and and have on

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
the um you know the plate that we want

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
to get to as well i mean i think a a big

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
one that i think is

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,120
has a lot of clear impact is like the

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
community fund

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,120
that we've we've started to flesh out um

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
in the node space we used to have the uh

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
travel fund and we still

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
you know do but we're working on

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,879
morphing that into more of a community

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,159
fund so it's not just travel specific

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,360
but uh we have a a good chunk of money

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,360
set aside

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,840
that folks from the community or the

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
projects can

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,640
request uh funds for uh various

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,840
reasons i mean a common one in the past

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
would be

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
someone who wants to speak or be engaged

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,319
at some sort of event

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
that's related to our projects or our

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,400
foundation uh we would

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
uh reimburse them for their travel to

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
get to and from and other expenses that

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,920
came along with that

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
uh so we're trying to broaden that scope

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
uh but that's a really i think tangible

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,799
thing that people

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
can can can benefit from another thing

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,040
that

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
that we've done although it's hard to

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
speak specific

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
too specifically in this case but we've

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
got such a

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,319
good group of people with such a broad

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
range of expertise there have definitely

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
been times where

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,840
we've and helped maintainers sort of

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,799
connect with

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,199
experts on specific issues like security

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,000
vulnerabilities and sort of the process

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
of and kind of responding and

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
understanding like

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,720
the scope or impact of a report

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
um and that's just been i know really

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
helpful for a number of running

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
maintainers

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
um and we've got a collab space actually

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
that's kind of popping up around that

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
too

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,960
so that's one i know has been

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
made a big difference for folks this

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
year as well yeah for sure

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,800
and i i think we'll get in the collab

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
spaces more in a few minutes but

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
yeah there are lots of things that we're

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
working on like standards is another one

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
uh that just popped up immediately when

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,199
we started uh

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
uh working together at this level

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,919
right like book club you know i had to

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,759
pop by

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,199
but um you know that's just sort of this

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
like just

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,039
community of people on slack where we

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,880
just started exchanging like oh i just

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,800
read this it was really good

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,080
and now there's this really active sort

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
of exchange of

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
people talking about um you know things

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
that

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
books they've read recently that they

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
love and we even have

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
like uh periodic calls where we get

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
together and talk about

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
programming books or open source books

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
or whatever so that's been so fun

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
yeah and we do have a lot of fun people

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
uh in the group and we

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
just generally have fun with whatever

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
we're doing uh it's really a great group

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,039
of people have

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,080
emerged um active in the space but we

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,680
wanted to talk about which is uh

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
collaboration spaces

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
and i think the the driving force of

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,199
this uh when it was created

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
was that we want to provide

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,880
uh opportunities for folks who are sort

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
of outside of um

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,919
either a project or the foundation work

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
but generally just people in the

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
ecosystem that want to

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,960
get involved and help uh make positive

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
impact in

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,440
in the space that we're all working in

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,039
uh so this concept of collaboration

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,919
spaces was created

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,599
uh thank you to michael dawson for for

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,199
uh spearheading that

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,280
um and so it's a place where you know um

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,240
jory had mentioned uh earlier the the

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
security vulnera

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
vulnerabilities um collaboration spaces

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,240
that's been spun up

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,840
uh you know there are a variety of

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
people from different areas of the

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
ecosystem that are coming together to

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,919
work on

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,160
that problem um and and try to make

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,639
progress there

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
yeah that's going to be and spearheaded

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,520
and i believe

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,800
darcy clark and wes todd also have a

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,400
talk um

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
specifically about this that they're

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,919
going to share as part of openjs world

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,639
so go over and check that talk out

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,159
if you're interested but it's a great

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
example of

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
the foundation providing some resources

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
and support

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,760
for the community both folks within our

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
projects and also

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,640
member organizations and and other open

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
source projects who aren't part of our

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,399
family

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,120
to get together uh talk about

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,240
the issues and figure out how they could

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
maybe

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,240
work together on a on an approach to

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,760
reduce noise and package

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,920
and security vulnerability reporting

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,959
so that's going to be really

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,800
taking off i think later this summer

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,399
and then we'll have others that we're

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,160
going to announce soon i'm sitting here

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,440
we're recording this a few days before

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
the conference so i'm not

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,720
sure what will exactly be public but i

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
know there's a couple more coming down

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,519
the pipeline that we're

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,920
really excited to see announced um and

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
uh that there anything that you can

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,200
think of

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
in terms of maybe you have an interest

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
around

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,600
a specific space like iot or

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
you want to work on tooling or you want

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,640
to work on

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,200
packages or you want to work on just

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
something in the community a collab

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
space may be

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
a place that you can come to the

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,399
foundation and get some support and

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,040
talk to our network uh about uh

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,640
collaborating on it yeah yeah and this

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
kind of brings up a good point because

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
as you were talking i wanted to

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
encourage folks to get involved if they

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,160
have an idea that they think would make

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,040
a great collaboration collaboration

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
space

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,360
um you know what steps would they take

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,760
to even suggest it or propose it

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
and i actually needed to go to the to

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
our github repository

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
to uh to find out more information uh

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
because it wasn't

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
at my fingertips as to how to go about

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
doing that and i'm gonna throw up a

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,880
banner here really quickly

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,200
um so here is the our our our github

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,760
repository for the cross project council

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,680
um and and i'll just take a quick moment

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,480
to talk about like open open source

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
although i know

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
uh on on the day of the event uh michael

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,160
dawson and beth griggs and i

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
are doing a keynote about open open

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,079
source but the concept is that we try to

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,480
do as much in the open as possible

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,399
so for example in github our meetings

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
are streamed public our meeting notes

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,160
are

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
are committed to github um slack and all

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,399
these other places where you can get

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
involved

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
but you know my instinct was i don't

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
know how to do this so i'm going to go

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,320
to the github repository and find

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
the uh the the document and at the top

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
level there's a collaboration space

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
progression

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
document that gives you the steps for

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,079
how to uh suggest

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,279
a proposal so if you have any ideas for

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,800
collaboration space

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,600
or anything else that you want to get

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,920
involved with us please go to github

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
look in the the documents uh issues and

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
pr's are

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,399
a good place to check out too but we

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,360
welcome everyone to

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,200
to get involved and of course if you

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959
want help sort of brainstorming that

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,120
idea or refining that further

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,079
uh you know slack is a great place for

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
that too

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
yeah for sure

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,640
cool well um that is kind of

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,880
all about collab spaces i know that

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
this time next year we'll be talking a

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
lot more in depth about

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
several of the cloud spaces that are

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,839
launching this year um but we want to

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,320
make sure that if you're interested

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,680
in working with the open.js foundation

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
or any of its projects

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,200
or extended network that you think about

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,560
doing that through collab space so

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,680
um should we talk about the standards

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,720
working group joe we

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,760
you mentioned earlier the structure of

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,519
the node foundation which we largely

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,839
incorporated in many ways

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,440
into the cross project council included

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
a lot of working groups and things like

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,959
that

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,839
the standards working group is uh but

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
one

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,279
and it's one that's been really active

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,440
lately huh yeah

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,440
yeah like i said this this seemed uh

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
yeah so standards working group and and

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,399
has been uh fairly active lately we've

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
had some invited speakers uh

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,920
talking to us about a few different um

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
things uh

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,000
but yeah it's a that's also an exciting

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,440
place to to get involved and again

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
you don't have to be a part of a project

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,240
to to come and um

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,160
you know start to to engage in that work

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
so uh please feel free to but

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,279
um yeah why don't we dig into a couple

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,680
of things that's been going on

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,639
yeah so you know and this is another

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
space where

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
you we really aren't expecting people to

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,959
have a lot of um

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
prior prior experience it's just in the

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,519
same way you don't have to have prior

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
experience in open source to get

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,800
involved in the open js foundation

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,160
you don't have to have prior experience

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
and standards to get involved with the

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,240
standards working group

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
in fact one of our goals for this year

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,880
is to

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
really develop a set of resources and a

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
website

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,200
for developers and those interested to

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
learn

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
more about standardization activities

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
and in general

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,560
what we've found is that it's still

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
really opaque

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
for a developer who uh maybe wants to

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,519
get involved in

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
web api standardization in some way to

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,279
understand

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,160
you know where where do you go to get

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
information

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,680
outside of say mdn um you know

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,760
where where where is this information

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,360
found in terms of like what the process

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,800
is that sort of stuff so our team is

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
pulling together

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,000
a set of educational materials that

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
should give

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
people the context and hopefully just

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
the background

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,079
and info that they need to be successful

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,199
as they learn

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,240
more about participating in say the

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,360
javascript

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,920
standardization process or a web api

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,720
process

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
or something like that so yeah i think

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
it's really

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
this is going to be a really valuable

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
resource because we do

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,639
you know we're fortunate that we have

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,120
experts in a number of these

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
you know standards bodies the work

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
that's going on in a variety of areas so

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,360
whether it's um you know ecmascripts and

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,480
and the ecma found

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,199
international and uh tc39 work

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
or uh w3c what working group kind of

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,880
work

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,800
um you know there's there's

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
we're lucky that we have a people from

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,360
all these different areas coming

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
together to talk about this i mean the

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,839
first thing we need to do is figure out

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,360
what we're going to call it

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,880
uh which is always the first challenge

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
uh but i'm really excited about the

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
resources that we'll be able to provide

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,839
as we kind of flesh them out further

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,680
um it's uh it's exciting work

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,279
um those resources are currently

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,560
available on our

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,040
on our github repo which is

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,560
the slash standards instead of slash

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,279
cross project council

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
um but that will be available as a web

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,880
resource

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,360
very soon as joe mentioned there's so

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,800
many

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,839
awesome people in our community

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,800
that have a lot of experience in

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,120
standardization activities and they're

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,639
really excited to

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
share what they've learned and help

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,639
people you know

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
succeed where they may have failed in

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
the past or

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,800
made a mistake or whatever so you know

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,199
there's a lot of cooperation

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,519
and a lot of interest in mentorship and

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,720
teaching and that kind of thing so

00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,160
if you are at all curious

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
do do reach out and either watch that

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,160
repo

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,199
or come join us in slack

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,920
and get involved there

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,440
another way that we're supporting

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
standards work this year for our

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,040
projects

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
this is something people may not know

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
but uh

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,440
many of our projects like jquery for

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,480
example and node

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,279
uh and others have really

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
contributed a lot to standards work over

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
the years

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,560
and pep actually which was uh moved to a

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,600
meredith stage earlier in the year

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,920
was uh really instrumental early on in

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
pointer events that that that web

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,240
standard so

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,959
the jquery project always was quite uh

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
active in the javascript specification

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,759
for years and years and years

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,680
and so we're working on uh

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
just tightening that feedback loop

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,120
between the open source projects

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,720
that implement or create polyfills or

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
that sort of thing for

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,120
specs to the committees that are

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,480
standardizing those things and to the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
implementers so

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,160
um that's another area of focus this

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,319
year that we're really excited about

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
yeah it's amazing uh with all the

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,160
projects that we have

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,640
in the foundation which i think is well

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,760
into the 30s now almost 40 or so

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,600
it's like 37 now so

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,720
it's we're approaching the number where

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,720
i'm like ish

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,960
uh and it's exciting that other you know

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
uh uh projects are

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,520
are applying and and we're growing and

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,520
it's really uh exciting but um

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,280
you know there are new and old projects

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
in the foundation and and there's just a

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,720
lot of uh history and experience and

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,160
and a lot of um you know a lot to bring

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
to the table to work through the stuff

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
and i know

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,559
standards sometimes can be a little bit

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,320
daunting um you know reading a spec and

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,840
and figuring out how to get involved

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
uh but that's what we're here for is to

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,640
try and help people over that hurdle

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
um mentorship or resources or what have

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,919
you so

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
it's exciting uh i'll just add two

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,160
really quickly we

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,480
you know we meet regularly uh the openjs

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
uh calendar is is readily available

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,400
there are zoom links typically in

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
in the meetings uh entries so if you

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,960
want to get involved in any of the

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
things or lurk in a meeting

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
you don't even have to get involved you

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
can just hang out and see what we're

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,480

yes um great that you mentioned like

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,799
like how to read a spec for example

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,080
that's one resource that we're going to

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,600
provide and

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,520
thanks to james from the tc39 community

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
there so you know that's the kind of

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
thing

a really big program

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,720
and that we launched earlier this year

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
um

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,280

um this is our individual supporter

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,039
program so one of the

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
things that people have wanted to know

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
for years is

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,320
hey you know my company can't join but

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,280
i'd like to support

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,200
the projects in some way is there an

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,480
individual membership or is there some

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,320
some way i can do that and we

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
the cross project council put our heads

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
together and

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,360
came up with this program called

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,160
javascript landia

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,520

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
already got

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
i'm bouncing around and looking at the

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
website uh maybe i'll even

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,679
maybe i'll even share it here um we've

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
already got

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,320
uh i think like 200 members or so

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,159
in in the uh in our supporters our

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
individual supporter program

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
um i hope they don't mind that i now

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,640
that i share this here but

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,640
uh but yeah it's a really exciting and

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,760
active program

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,760
and yes and so

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,559
with this site that that joe just showed

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
is our is our existing website that's

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,760
going to be converted very soon

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,600
um to a passport site actually where

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,400
you'll be able to click into each

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
and if you for example want to click on

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,919
me

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,480
you would see all of the badges that i

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,159
you know

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,200
um that i all the things i've supported

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,280
or whatever so

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,520
uh it's a little bit more of like a the

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,880
concept being sort of a passport and you

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,880
can collect your passports

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,640
this is sort of the beginning of the

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,000
program as well um so as we said we

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
launched this earlier in the year with

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
just one badge and

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,720
you know a monthly newsletter and with

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,520
the

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,640
event this week where uh we're launching

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,360
the new site

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,520
and a lot more badges for our

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,080
participants so if you want to collect a

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
badge

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,919
either to display on your github profile

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,760
on your website on linkedin or whatever

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,640
you can you can join jslint

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,480
the jslandia program and do that um but

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
we also imagine a world where

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,480
we're getting these folks like more and

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,120
more involved in our

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,240
in our programs and in ideas and and

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
campaigns

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,960
uh that support our open source

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,960
maintainers and their projects so

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,679
uh you know this is obviously we're in a

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,000
unique situation in the last year or so

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,159
we haven't been able to

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,679
do the meet ups do the in-person stuff

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,799
that we wanted to do but

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,720
we think our jslandia crew our

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
participants are just the right group to

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,440
help us

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,720
get back into those spaces when uh

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,320
when it is prudent to do so

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
yeah and i'm looking forward to those

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,039
those times um

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
be quiet you too um i i think what's

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,320
great too is like

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,000
we've been talking a lot about ways for

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,840
people to get involved and that's really

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
the the takeaway here like we want

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,960
folks to get involved in the work that

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
we're doing we're having fun but we're

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,520
also

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,520
you know like really just trying to um

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,679
just work for the community and make

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,880
things you know better for everybody and

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,360
have fun doing it

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
and you know a rising tide lifts all

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,159
boats and i think if we all kind of chip

00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,919
in and work together

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
like there's so much fun great stuff

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
that we can do that can really be

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,880
beneficial to the community

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
so you know i know we've mentioned it a

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,000
few times we have this

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
helpful url that will give you all sorts

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,640
of ways to get involved uh

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,880
slack the calendar um github

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,600
uh everything should be kind of there

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,520
and yeah that's our call to action yeah

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,000
you know really the only requirement

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,200
is you know passion for javascript and

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,080
the desire to help

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
um you know the the project communities

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
that

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,039
that we support um we've got a lot of

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,039
big plans

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,520
and we need help sort of figuring out

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,400
