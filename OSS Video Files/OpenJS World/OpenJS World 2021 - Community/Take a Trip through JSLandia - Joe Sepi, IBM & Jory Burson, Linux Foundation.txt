	Take a Trip through JSLandia - Joe Sepi, IBM & Jory Burson, Linux Foundation

Your hosts will take you on a magical and wonderful trip through the world of JSLandia. Meet new friends and old and travel to places fore-to untold. Letâ€™s have some fun skipping down the road paved with hexagon stickers and shades of green blocks. Writing the story as we go. Talk title and abstract reserve the right to be modified. Thanks.
