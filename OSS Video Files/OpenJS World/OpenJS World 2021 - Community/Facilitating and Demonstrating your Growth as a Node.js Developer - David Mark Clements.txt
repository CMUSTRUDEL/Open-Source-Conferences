	Facilitating and Demonstrating your Growth as a Node.js Developer - David Mark Clements

David Mark Clements has been working with Node.js for 10 years (since Node 0.4) and has been working with JavaScript for over 20 years. In that time he has mentored, taught and led many Frontend and Node.js developers. This combined teaching and software engineering experience has been distilled into three training courses and three certified examinations. In this talk, David will map out a path to help fill any knowledge gaps and accelerate your growth as a Node.js developer in a verifiable, certifiable way.

hi there welcome to facilitating and

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,320
demonstrating your growth as a node.js

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
developer

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,559
uh at the bottom of the screen there's a

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
url you can follow short url dot at

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
forward slash

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,600
ux lowercase hmq

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,480
uppercase in case um you need access to

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,720
the slides

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,720
um in an easy way

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
let's get started so we're going to be

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
talking about

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,040
um a couple of areas we'll be talking

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,239
about demand

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:46,480
um about how to fulfill that demand

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,800
uh we're going to be talking about the

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,719
things that we can do uh to skill up

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,120
and the things that we can do to verify

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,120
uh that we have indeed skilled up

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,640
just a little bit before that i'll

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,400
explain who i am

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,439
uh i've been in programming since

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
fairly young age in the last 10 years

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,400
i've been doing consulting technical

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
leadership

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
um i i haven't i'm the author and

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
contributor to a number of open source

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,200
projects including

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,240
um pino and xerox

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,040
and i'm involved in fastify

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
a little bit as well um for the last

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
five years

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
uh i've been working alongside the linux

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
foundation

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
and the opengs foundation which when we

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
started this

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,520
uh was actually the node foundation um

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
and i'm uh the technical lead uh of some

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
of the things i'm gonna be talking about

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
and the primary author of them as well

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,159
and i'm also the author of the trainings

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,479
um uh so that's

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,479
that's who i am okay

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,680
so

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,319
demand for talent

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,720
is high and it just keeps on growing

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,160
however we're at a sort of a place where

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,959
a lot of people are trying to fulfill

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,239
that demand but

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,280
the demand isn't quite matched to

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,440
the skill level that a lot of people in

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,879
the industry are currently at

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:37,840
and what this talk is about is trying to

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,840
bridge that gap

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,599
so javascript's

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
very easy it's the lingua franca

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,560
of the internet uh it's used in node.js

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
it's used for iot

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
it's used for a bunch of things and and

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
if you're doing small easy things with

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,599
it

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,040
it's fine um but it is

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,480
uh difficult to master uh

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
and use it a sort of upper intermediate

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
level let's say and that extends to

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
node.js

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,519
um not in every company

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,360
but there is a trend that i've observed

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,319
during my years of consulting uh

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
where the entry-level developers that

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,400
have been

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,440
hired uh don't get as much

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,360
mentoring as uh would

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,120
would be preferred

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,040
and part of this is that um

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
the more senior senior you are in an

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,959
organization

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,959
uh the more limited your time is

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,840
the organization is focused on

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,879
meeting the bottom line and and

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
accelerating

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,280
in the market so

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,920
that puts people that are

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
st that are sort of at a lower skill

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,040
level

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,239
uh at a disadvantage because

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,360
uh they don't necessarily

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,560
get the time and space to

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,079
digest the things that are going on

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,080
um and that in an environment

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,400
that leans towards um delivery which is

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
good

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,639
but with delivery you need quality

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,000
and quality in terms of

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,759
writing code comes from

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,639
sort of thinking a lot in your own space

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
uh about how to write code and having

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
interactions with people that have done

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,160
a lot of that thinking

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,000
um so there's a overall

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,080
the the industry is not um

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,039
focused on on skilling up developers

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,639
um and this has created sort of a chasm

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,720
uh between

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
entry-level developers and intermediate

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,560
to senior level developers

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,639
um people people want to work

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,919
organizations want to hire and

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,240
uh but they will hire people that are

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,400
at a upper intermediate level to senior

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,840
level

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,470
more than they will entry level in

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
many cases

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,520
[Music]

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,199
this can lead to another

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
issue that i've observed in the industry

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,960
which is developers overselling

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,720
themselves and they oversell themselves

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
in order to get to get the job

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
and then what happens is they struggle

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,199
to

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,240
deliver uh and that turns into

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,960
essentially a personal hell um

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
you this that kind of approach can lead

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,720
to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,080
you know working way too many hours

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,280
for uh what a person should work um

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
so try to avoid doing that because uh

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
you'll

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,880
you'll get yourself into potentially um

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,840
hot hot water um

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,759
so ideally what we need is we need a way

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,280
to to leapfrog this situation we need a

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
path forward

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,759
um that allows for uh

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,000
rapid improvement um but that's

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,120
connected to real real-world scenarios

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,880
to real things that you do in a day job

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
and then we need to be able to verify

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,000
that quickly and easily

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,120
it would be good if employers could

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,319
uh with a quick check

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,199
know uh that the person they're hiring

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,000
is uh capable of delivering for the role

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
that they're hiring for

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:04,160
so there's a there's those are ways to

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:07,520
skill up there's loads of ways to grow

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,960
um some are harder to verify than others

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,160
um you need to to be able to verify

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,759
someone who's at an intermediate or

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
upper intermediate level

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,800
you need at least someone at that same

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,720
level preferably higher

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,000
to to to verify that and

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:29,199
that's quite a difficult qualitative

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,199
qualitative endeavor

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,560
so when it comes to certifying

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
um this isn't this is an optimization

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,440
for the industry

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,639
um and so what we've done is

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,160
uh what myself and and others that i'll

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,039
talk about and

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,039
the organizations involved have done is

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,919
created a pathway

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:57,599
um to uh to skill up

00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,479
and verify that you've scaled up

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
and this is the path

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,479
so over on the left there's a training

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,599
course that i wrote

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,919
called introduction to node.js

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479
this is a good sort of overview it can

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,960
fill any knowledge gaps um

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,720
but if you're already fairly familiar uh

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
you you probably don't need to take

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
you probably don't need to start there

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,440
but it's it's worth checking out

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,879
um if you don't use node uh all the time

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
for instance or you only use it for

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,720
front front-end

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,200
stuff then is

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,039
the node services development training

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,080
which is a training that i wrote

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,120
to cater to the node services developer

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,000
examination and certification

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,399
i suggest doing that one before the node

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,959
application developer certification

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
um because the services developer exam

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,080
is a broad

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,279
uh practical kind of focused

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
uh exam that that that verifies that you

00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
can

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
you can write services with node which

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,000
is quite a common case in

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
in the industry um the node.js

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,880
application

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
development training is a training that

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,200
i

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
wrote to cater to the node.js

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,320
application developer

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,920
certification and that goes more broad

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
and allows you to have a fair amount of

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,120
depth

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,760
in node that gives you a flexibility for

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
various

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,920
other use cases other than building

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
services

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
so the introduction to node.js as i said

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
uh it's a sort of

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
uh it's a good course if you if you

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,240
don't use node every day

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,200
it's free you can optionally pay for a

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
certificate once you've completed it

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
we go through creating command line

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,680
interfaces building mock services

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
implementing real-time services and we

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,120
also talk about understanding

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,160
and leveraging the node.js ecosystem

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,680
this course uses fastify a fair amount

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,279
which is a

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,920
up-and-coming web framework

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,920
uh to to demonstrate these concepts but

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,320
the the concepts themselves can be

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,320
applied in to other frameworks right

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,440
node services developer uh

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,920
is about training you and certifying you

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
to the upper intermediate level so

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
between intermediate and senior

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
so it's not an easy exam and it is a

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
quite

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,600
uh rigorous uh training regime

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,360
um but the idea is if if you can

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
complete this exam

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,160
then you're probably most likely

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,279
uh able to uh work

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,399
every day um with with

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,920
creating services that are secure um

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,279
in a in a in a production environment

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,360
um it's designed to

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,560
establish practical effectiveness so

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,279
what we're trying to

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,720
what we're trying to show with someone

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
who's gone through the training and the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
certification for node services

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
developer

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
is that they're they use node in a

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,519
practical way

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,320
for common use cases

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,760
it contains a small amount of involved

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,000
questions there's about six

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
questions on there and they take about

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
between 15 and 30 minutes each to

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,399
complete so

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
they are very involved you're you're

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,040
building things you're putting things

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,839
together

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
and then and then you're submitting that

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,600
to be

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,640
to be marked it contains two

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,440
uh very broad topic domains

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,839
servers and services which make up 70 of

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
the

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
marks on the exam and security which

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,560
make up 30 of the marks on the exam

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,160
security is focused on um

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
the kind of common mistakes that you

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,040
could make in a service that

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,720
that would uh cause um

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,160
a vulnerability can't say much more than

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
that

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
but the training will go into more

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
details obviously

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,399
here's a testimonial by vinicius mussak

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,920
of smn technologies i very much like

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,920
the real code api construction requests

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
because it reflects our day jobs in our

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
companies

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
so the reason i chose this testimonial

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,839
was because it it reflects what i'm

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,600
trying to say about the node services

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,720
developer uh certification and training

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
and so forth is that

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
it's it's really trying to focus on

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,399
establishing whether you can solve

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,120
real-world problems using a common

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,639
approach or a common art piece of

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,000
architecture

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,040
that is used a lot

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,360
node application developer

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
also trains and certifies to the upper

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,480
intermediate level

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,320
and this is designed to establish

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,680
overall competency so

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:02,320
it goes through 13 topic domains

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,000
and contains many small questions

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,040
that are 5 to 10 minutes each so this is

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,399
more about uh can you do

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,160
individual um sort of

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,680
sort of single case uh things with node

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,320
and it and basically establishes

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,920
whether you're flexible in in how you

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,399
use node

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,320
the uh the exam is uh library and

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,000
framework agnostic you can use

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,680
anything you like as long as you

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,399
actually answer

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,720
the the or you solve the problem that's

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,600
that's put before you uh the training

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
itself focuses on node core knowledge

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,959
and includes a couple of key useful

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,320
libraries um

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,279
for for um solving the the same problems

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,760
that you would find on the exam

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,880
uh the the main point of the application

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,160
developer

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,600
uh training and certification is

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,600
um to to sort of help you have

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,839
key transferable skills that can work in

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,399
many many areas when you're working with

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
node.js

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,399
so this is this is the breakdown of the

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,600
the domains

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,959
and the weightings as you can see it's a

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,920
fairly even spread of a lot of things

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,880
control flow event system and buffers

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
and streams

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,079
tend to take the the most weight

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,079
but they're all fairly evenly spread

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,000
this is a testimony from luke chinworth

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
of solid digital i liked that the

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
questions

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,240
were directly related to real world

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,959
tasks

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,760
so again in both exams and in both

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,360
trainings we are

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,600
trying to connect with

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,600
real-world everyday things that you may

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,120
do

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,079
i've as i say i've worked in the

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,800
industry for for 10 years

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,240
in terms of actually creating the the

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,480
domains and creating the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
questions i wasn't the only one there

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,519
were others involved who

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,519
also had a lot of industry experience

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,639
and our main focus was

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:14,560
trying to uh um again

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:18,079
connect the the exam questions to

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
uh to real-world scenarios

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,800
so these are some of the people that

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,320
were involved

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,639
at the beginning in 2016 we met in

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
uh with some of these people in austin

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,160
and uh

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,360
we worked together to decide what should

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,639
be on

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,959
uh a node.js exam and then over over

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
time

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
i continued to to work with everyone and

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,720
and work to

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,800
to push things forward um uh

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
until we were able to to get it out so

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
these people

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
know who they are if you recognize any

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
of them send them some love

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
they're fantastic people

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,199
these are the organizations that have

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,240
been involved and are involved in

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,399
the the the creation and the

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
infrastructure surrounding uh these

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
exams

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,120
we have near form uh a consultancy

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,320
company

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,320
that uh is that sponsored me essentially

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,600
to to do the technical pieces

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,399
uh for automated validation software and

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
so forth

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
and the authoring of the content and

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
actually some reviewing as well

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
uh node source that have a product

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,639
called n-solid

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,720
that help with the the operational side

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,440
of things and reviewing

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
the open js foundation is the certifying

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,320
body

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,560
um uh openjs uh

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
is hosting the this conference at the

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
minute

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
um and uh they will actually be sending

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,839
out

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,320
uh an email

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,480
on how you can get a discount on the

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,279
training 50 discount

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,040
um psi are a proctoring body so when you

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,079
take the exam

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,640
there's a human person uh

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
who watches you take the exam and that

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,760
you can ask questions

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
and uh if you have any issues or

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,280
anything that you can talk to

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,720
trueability uh hosts the actual exam

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,400
platform the exam is conducted in

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,280
a vm i'm going to

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,919
show you some other talks to refer to

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,880
and other materials to refer to

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,880
for going into more details on that and

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
the linux foundation

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,240
is uh uh responsible for vending and

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
coordination

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,480
so just a few notes on rigor

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,240
um the uh the training both the training

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,880
and the examination

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,000
uh are consistently monitored by myself

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,120
and updated based on changes in the

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,799
industry

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,919
and new versions of node the exam

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,480
environment is pinned to

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,000
the latest lts version the latest

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
long-term support version of node which

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is currently

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,039
node 14. in october of this year

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,320
we'll be up upgrading it again this is

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,080
this will be the

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,360
uh second upgrade and the third

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,520
um release of the exam we'll be

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,400
upgrading again to node 16.

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,280
um the prior release that we did in

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
october

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,360
uh updating to uh

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
i forget which note i think was no 12.

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,679
um

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,799
uh yes it was uh the no sorry the prior

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
release was no 14

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,640
and we updated that so that you can use

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,559
ecmascript modules natively we don't

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,520
make that the default in the exam

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,080
because currently in the industry people

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,559
aren't using native ecmascript modules

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
they're using maybe transpiled and

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,880
different things but that's different

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
so when the industry starts to use them

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
uh in anger

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,960
um then we'll update the exam so that

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,640
that's the default instead of

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,880
requiring model exports for it this is

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,720
an example of how we keep it

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,640
updated we also conduct fairly frequent

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,320
psychometric analysis we have a

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,440
psychometrician who goes

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,280
and analyzes the uh the

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
how many people are passing and failing

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
individual questions

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,360
and then uses statistics to measure

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,160
whether those questions

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,720
are are healthy uh in terms of

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,280
the difficulty level and that we expect

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,039
it to be

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
and the difficulty level that it appears

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,280
to be from that analysis

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,880
and then we uh adjust based on that so

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,320
we're constantly

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,760
uh tweaking uh to to improve it and have

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
been doing for um

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,039
i think two and a half years now so it's

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,640
gone into a really

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,559
um really great place place i think um

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
we also do sample manual marking from

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,480
time to time uh

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,600
to because our marking is actually

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,320
automated

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,880
um to to check that things are working

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,360
as we

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
expect

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
here's a testimony from nathaniel

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,600
bergwin

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,600
of chief technologist of technologist of

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,960
booze allen hamilton

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,120
as a manager i would feel

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
confident in a candidate who possessed

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,400
this certification

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,520
obviously the reason i've chosen that

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,520
testimonial is to

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,679
support my point or that

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,200
the whole purpose of the training and

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,120
the certification

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,159
is to help people

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,039
go from one skill level to another skill

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,280
level

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,280
and have that skill level easily

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,640
verified

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,080
using our certification badges that can

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
go through a verification process

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,320
so that so that when people are

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,600
hiring they can they can make informed

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,960
decisions

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,200
um i'm going to read it one more time

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,480
as a manager i would feel confident in a

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
candidate who possessed this

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,200
certification

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,760
here's some resources uh if you want to

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
dig deeper i've spoken about this a few

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,720
times

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,039
and also with the excellent adrian

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,760
estrada of uh node source

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,720
uh there's a keynote uh that we did at

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,919
an open js

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,200
event when we used to do them in person

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
hopefully we'll be doing that again at

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
some point in the future

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,039
and a couple of others there there's

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,559
also a really great

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,200
blog post by someone who

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,040
who took the training and the exam and

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
they write

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,159
[Music]

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,760
they write up about their experience so

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,720
check that out

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,720
it's very good

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
one other point the retake is free so if

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,960

developer exams

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,600
um i've already mentioned this but um

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,880
i think for a limited time uh there's a

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,159
discount of 50 uh for

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,080
uh the training material and

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,799
certification material and you should

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,200
have an email

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
