Description: 
	Digital services play an integral part in our daily lives. Many great things resulted from it but also many undesirable side effects. For example, digital services are responsible for 4% of global CO2 emissions, more than aviation.
As a developer, we can wonder what can we do to be more responsible in our work and reduce the negative side effects of it. How can we work on being more inclusive? On making our apps more accessible? How can we reduce the energy consumption of our software?
Join us to discuss what is responsible code and what can we do to implement it in our work.
