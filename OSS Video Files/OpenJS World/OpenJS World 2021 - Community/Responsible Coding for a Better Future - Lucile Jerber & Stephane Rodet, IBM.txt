Title: Responsible Coding for a Better Future - Lucile Jerber & Stephane Rodet, IBM
Publication date: 2021-05-31
Playlist: OpenJS World 2021 - Community
Description: 
	Digital services play an integral part in our daily lives. Many great things resulted from it but also many undesirable side effects. For example, digital services are responsible for 4% of global CO2 emissions, more than aviation.
As a developer, we can wonder what can we do to be more responsible in our work and reduce the negative side effects of it. How can we work on being more inclusive? On making our apps more accessible? How can we reduce the energy consumption of our software?
Join us to discuss what is responsible code and what can we do to implement it in our work.

hello and welcome to this session i am

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,759
mr jarabe working at ibm in the tech

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,920
role and passionate about sustainability

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
and working to fight climate change

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
today i will be talking to you about

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,200
responsible computing

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
and how you can start implement it at

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,359
scale within your company

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,880
as you probably know already if you came

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,279
to this session we need to start

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,519
thinking differently about technology

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
it's all about media and your sources we

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,599
have cambridge and lady gaga the dark

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,640
side of social media data breaches

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,040
and bitcoin data centers and ai using up

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
the world's energy

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,719
the way ibm decided to address this was

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
through the responsible computing

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
framework

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
the framework is split into six main

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
categories

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
free about social topics so impact

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
system

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,079
and data usage and free robot technology

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,000
so data center infrastructure and code

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,680
my focus was on code and i'm guessing

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
yours would have been too

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,719
so what is responsible code responsible

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
code is to be aware of the potential

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,960
environmental

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,240
societal and economic impact your design

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,880
and requirement choices could have

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
and how you can minimize their negative

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
impact

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
now we've seen already some of the

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
negative impact of technology but i

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,240
still want to spend a minute

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,720
on the impact of iit on our environment

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,400
indeed digital sources amount to four

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,360
percent of the global

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
queen has gas emission so twice that of

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
aviation

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
and it's important to understand where

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,320
most of our work

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,759
is if we want to reduce the impact on

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,280
our environment

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,560
so first what are the kind of impact

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,360
i.t can have on our environment so

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
obviously there is energy use and a

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
greenhouse gas emission

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
associated to it we have the water

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
consumption to create

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
new equipment and the depletion of

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,799
resources

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
again linked to the creation of

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,119
equipment

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
and out of all of this a study by united

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
ranked

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
by categories with numbers it's an

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
approximation obviously

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,400
as you can guess these are numbers that

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,720
are quite hard to estimate

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,599
precisely especially since they are

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,599
spread around four categories

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,440
so as you can see data centers that are

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,000
often depicted as a villain

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
at the bottom of the impact hierarchy

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
for digital services

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
both at the energy consumption and

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
manufacturing level

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
it doesn't mean we don't have to do

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,040
things the trade has been impacted

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
but it shows that we can have a huge

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
impact

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,239
at the user level especially

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
regarding the manufacturing of equipment

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
so the manufacturing of user equipment

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,360
is responsible for more than half

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360
of impact as developer our biggest

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
focus should be around making sure that

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
our software

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,080
and apps are fast and light to remove as

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
much as possible the need for users to

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
upgrade their hardware to match our

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,680
software needs

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
so now let's talk about how we can

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
reduce the impact of code on our

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
environment

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
step one is to remove unnecessary

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
features

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
and code the same way you would say the

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
best

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,640
trash is the one that does not exist but

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
pollution

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,879
you can say the same about code so the

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
best code slash feature is the one that

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,879
does not

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,519
exist removing userless feature in your

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,239
code will

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
inevitably reduce the impact of your app

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,879
obviously because

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,080
you will need less computing power less

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,599
energy to run it

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,200
and less data will be hosted an example

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,000
of design choices that you need to

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
always remove

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
is autoplay because you use data and

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
energy to run the video

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,640
but might not even interest the user and

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,560
also if you have user that are

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,720
visually impaired and might mess with

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
their experience on your web page

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,640
so you can answer things about following

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
the requirements so for example if you

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,400
use an ai model in your app

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,760
you might have seen that training them

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,799
is quite resource intensive

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,959
so switching maybe from a 98 recognition

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,200
to a 95 or 90

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120
might be enough for your use case and

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
usually the last percent

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
every other want to get so low in the

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,280
bar

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,960
can save quite a bit of energy and while

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,280
designing your app you

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
want to really keep only what is

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
necessary

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
so rethink all of your ideas track what

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,639
feature users use and don't use to only

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
keep the best and most interesting

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,960
feature

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
so that is digital minimalism so now

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
that all

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,199
unnecessary things are removed you want

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
to make sure that the code that is

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
left follows a certain agent that will

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,759
help on social

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,919
economic and environmental areas

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
so first off you want clean and reusable

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,800
code that way the resources you've spent

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
while developing your code so human

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,759
and economic and computing resources

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,520
will not be wasted because you have to

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
redevelop your app

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,400
second you want code that is inclusive

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,960
think of everyone with disability

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,680
we are lucky enough in the web area to

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
have a standard but it's called the wcag

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
2.1

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,039
so you just need to have an aaa rating

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
on this one

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,880
um ibm also made a website

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
available for you with tools to test

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
accessibility

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
of your web page and you also want your

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,479
code to not follow the digital divide

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
meaning make it work for people that are

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,000
not as technology savvy as you are

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
or have a bad internet connection and

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
finally you want inclusivity in your

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,080
illustration

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,800
videos and forms so that everyone feels

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
included

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,680
on your website and stay

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,759
wary of biases in ai models apis or data

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
sets you are working with

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,160
and once you've done all that you will

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
need to optimize your code

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,319
so i said previously most of the impact

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
of digital services happen in the

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
creation

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
of different terminals so the best way

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
of reducing

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
our impact is to fight against

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
obsolescence and having to upgrade the

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,479
hardware to match

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
software needs so when we use more

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,600
ram and cpu our computer usually goes

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
slower

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,319
and that drives we want in consumer to

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
upgrade to a new and faster computer

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,520
which is the main issue we have right

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
now

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,280
so optimizing your code and looking at

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,160
kpis such as cycle count cpu consumption

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,960
memory usage network calls size of your

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
page

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
is the way to go to try to keep

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
resources usage

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
as low as possible and to fight

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,400
obsolescence

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
so now i will show you a few tools that

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
you can use

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,240
right now to give you insights on your

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,000
web page and what you can change

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,720
so it goes from saying if your site

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,919
is fast to best practices that you might

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,919
want to implement

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,120
another way to optimize your code is to

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
use well-known and certified libraries

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
usually they already are optimized to

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,400
the best of what is possible however

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,919
so you do not have to spend your time

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,120
optimizing the code

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,280
yourself however if you do use that

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
just stay careful of possible data which

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,680
is when using public libraries

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
now that we have looked through all of

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
this you might think well

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,639
it's all filed well but i'm not alone in

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
my team

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,880
and i do not have the full creative

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,080
power of the application

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,199
that's true and that's what we'll focus

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,039
on for the rest of the presentation

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,960
so how do we get everyone to be on the

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,879
same team

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,479
so let me tell you about my story and

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,639
the way i started acting

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,720
to make sustainability more of a common

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,879
topic to be discussed

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,479
so that everyone in my team thinks about

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,319
it not just me

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,960
so when i first started working within

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
my company i looked around and i saw so

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
many things that could change

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,919
and that needed to change and and i

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
think

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,720
we all do one of that things was about a

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,199
very specific

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
topic on sustainability and lucky enough

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,080
i found someone

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
else that wanted to do something about

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,759
it around a coffee machine

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,680
so we started getting in touch with the

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
person in charge of such things to

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
discuss possible challenges

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
and while talking to them we found out

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,000
that we had been approached by two other

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,560
people

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
on the topic so i wasn't alone trying to

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
change

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,560
things all i needed to do was to find

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,599
others like me

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,880
and start working on things together so

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,560
as far as gathered

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
and we started talking about all the

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,880
things we felt need to change

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
and let me tell you we were creative and

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,800
at big ideas

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
the thing about big dreams is that you

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
need to put

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
in the rock to make sure that you can

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
reach them

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,959
and the first thing to ask that matter

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,000
was that we needed to be taking

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
seriously

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,279
and not just as idealists as might be

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
the case when it came to sustainability

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,600
a few years ago

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,519
and still do and so we worked hard on

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
making professional presentations the

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
same way we will do

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,959
if we were talking to a client even if

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
it was all about

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,360
internal topics and not a business faded

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,000
on

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
so we started by creating a structure

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
that could scale

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,600
to get more people in and then we made

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
branding so we had a logo and a catchy

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
name that was korean

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,440
with our company's brand so if you do

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
the same make sure that the people

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
in charge of the brand for your company

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
know about your project

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,560
otherwise you might get in trouble

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
because there is

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
a lot of legal aspect linked to branding

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
so that's why we chose to keep our

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,760
branding internal and i'm not showing

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,839
it to you right now then we chose a

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,480
project that we knew would be achievable

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
and that we were passionate about uh but

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
we

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
will be starting to have an impact and

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,880
not just be about talking but

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,079
also action we believe this will also

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
give us more credibility

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,880
when presenting our project later

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,959
especially to executives

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,760
once we had a solid base we started

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,200
expanding and finding people like us

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
that were interesting about

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
sustainability and wanted to act

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
that way we started to grow and work on

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,200
more projects

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
and we ended up with quite a big

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
community so now if you want to do the

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
same

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
i can give you some advice of what i

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
found and learn

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
along the way so first start small

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
then scale this is key because in the

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
beginning you will

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,839
encounter a lot of setback and it will

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,920
require a lot of on top work

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
so you will need to be passionate about

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
what you are doing

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
in order to not lose interest and

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
motivation

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
and so focus on one project with people

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
you trust

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,920
and make it become a reality that way

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,800
you will learn a lot about the internal

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,279
dynamics within your company

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,079
you want also to create a structure that

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,200
will survive

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,880
scaling you want to create a brand to

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,880
have more impact

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,040
we want to find leaders and people in

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,839
position of power that will support

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
and help your project and community

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
otherwise again

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,760
you will not go far and once you've done

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,920
all of that you will then want to find

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,160
more people to work on your project

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
so now let me go into the final tips and

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,880
tricks to creating your community

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,760
so in the beginning do not cont your

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,200
hours creating community takes time you

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,240
have to work on branding

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,120
structure presentation you also need to

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,360
onboard new people and find sponsors so

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,040
as you can guess it takes quite some

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,079
time

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,160
also most people who will talk to one

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
working on project

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
will be on board to help you but most of

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,360
the time you have to remind yourself

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,320
that you are adding

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,279
to their workload so if you want your

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
project to become

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,680
a reality you really need to add them as

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,920
much as possible

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,760
you also want to be really professional

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,200
and treat it like you will treat any

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,839
other business

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,440
and when you are talking to other people

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,720
within your company to

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,560
get their help or support make sure to

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,920
personalize your presentation to

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
the audience a presentation will not be

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,639
the same for

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,440
hr than it will be for a business leader

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
because as you can guess they will be

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
interesting in different metrics

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,920
different kpis

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,839
which is another thing make sure that

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
whenever you discuss your project with

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,440
someone

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,279
the person you ask for help or support

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,399
will benefit from your project

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,079
too always involve the person in charge

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
of a topic in the discussion

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
and trust me on this one it will save

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,760
you a lot of time

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,760
also make sure that you have a way of

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,639
onboarding people and giving them

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,560
clear ways in which they can act indeed

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,800
most of the time people want to help

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
they just don't know how or where to

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,760
start

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
also most of the time what you are doing

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,639
with your community would be on top of

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
your job

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
and it would require a lot of work so

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,680
you need to remind yourself that

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
you need to keep it light and enjoy what

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
you are doing

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
otherwise you will lose interest and

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,519
motivation quite quickly

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
to me the benefit from this community

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
are multiple

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
the first one was obviously to find

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,880
others within our company that wanted to

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
act and we started using our energy and

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,160
passion towards something that was

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
productive

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,519
we ended up working on quite a few

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,680
projects and presentation

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
to teach our colleagues more about

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,360
sustainability

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,920
so this all led to the topic being more

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
and more discussed in regular meetings

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,360
and everyone's starting to think

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,920
more and more about it and also

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
our executives are the employees

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
speaking on this with a common and

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
bigger voice

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
so they now know what it really matters

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
to us

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
so now i'll let stefan walk you through

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,480
his parts on

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,800
how you can engage your team towards the

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
common goal

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,040
wow lucille thanks for your presentation

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,079
that's really so inspiring to

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
to hear it and you know this is a great

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,480
example to follow

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,519
how to actually make something happen

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,839
and and create enthusiasm

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,760
and and motivating people to to bring

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
change right

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,800
and also all those guidelines i think we

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,079
should really look

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,160
more at those uh i really see myself as

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,600
a developer that sometimes

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,720
i forget those so always a great

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,120
um inspiration

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,760
so the next point that comes when you

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,120
have

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,040
created a community and

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,279
you know people are eager to act and

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
share expertise

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,519
how do you actually manage to bring

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,639
change

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,720
in your product in your offering what

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,120
you are actually doing for work

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,399
right and this is very often when it

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
gets difficult

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,040
but why is that actually so difficult

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,639
to make it happen well

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,959
you know one thing is that the dimension

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,560
keep

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,880
increasing you have to take care about

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,680
efficiency you have to make your code

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
secure

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
accessible you know your solution has to

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,839
be 80 core

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,720
and so many other things data privacy

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,279
it keeps getting more complex to solve

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,040
right this is really

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,000
a major hurdle and also whether you want

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,120
it or not

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,120
regulation is coming this is an example

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,240
of a gdpr here

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,839
but on the climate side as well things

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
are not slowing down at the opposite

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,480
they are

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
getting faster and faster and the goals

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,199
are getting stronger and stronger each

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
year

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
so we really have to take new methods

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
for that we cannot

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,920
just do it the old way and just say yeah

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,839
look

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,600
we'll optimize a bit the front end and

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
make the database a bit smaller

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
whatever clean up a build to feel no you

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
really have

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,880
to go to much greater length and rethink

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,959
the way you work

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,480
one thing that i noticed though is that

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,920
bad decision

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,320
are less visible at the granular level

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
and very often they are you know they

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,120
are they are

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,800
full of good intention for example you

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
have this library that improve

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,399
user experience weights only 30

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
kilobytes

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:44,000
uh our page is already one megabyte so

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
this is not a big deal

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,240
and indeed it would actually not be a

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,079
big deal if that was

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,680
the single thing happening but there are

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,240
five other teams that i've seen

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,240
are changing their package and so this

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
is where you land with a two megabyte

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,519
page

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,920
so this is really

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
you know the way the team works and the

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
decisions are taking

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,880
are just not helping a lot so

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,959
what you see here is that responsible

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,959
computing is very much about discussing

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,240
tradeoffs

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,799
recently i also remember

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
on the forum someone saying you know

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,919
developers actually know how to make

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,760
code efficient

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,000
it's just a marketing team that comes

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,360
after them that pull all those

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
trackers and advertisements

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
and this makes the page then slow

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,840
and so that that was an interesting

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
thing for me because this was

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,080
made me think okay there seems to be a

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
problem of alignment with the rest of

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,559
the team like

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,480
not the whole team is the line on those

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,720
goals and if you have the

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
only the developers who care about this

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,559
this won't work

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
and it looks to me like this is often

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,320
the problems that happens in the team

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,400
you have either the developers or a

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
special group of interested people

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
around

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,440
ethic around sustainability around

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,720
accessibility depending of their own

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,200
interest

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,440
but that doesn't map to the whole team

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
and so here in the last decade working

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,799
with designers

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,160
i really learned a lot about how they

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,200
think and how they have

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,200
different methods for getting to success

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,240
and developer probably in my view i have

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,000
a lot to learn from this

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:40,080
so what do designers do generally they

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,240
don't accept to work on a single unit

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,559
problem they most of the time

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
take a look at the bigger picture as the

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,520
overall

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,799
context of the problem so for example

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,640
you would like to you would never

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,039
ask an entire designer in your apartment

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,120
to read you a door caller

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,480
you know you would at least ask them to

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,480
redo one room

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,640
and then what they will do they will

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,880
look at the way you live

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,200
your style preferences your budget

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:21,200
your house environment and all that and

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
and come up to an overall solution

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,000
and so what about if we had the same

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,000
view

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,039
on those coding topics as well

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,720
you know those co those topics that

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,080
actually we thought

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,760
just touch the code

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
but actually they don't they touch the

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,559
whole team

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,480
and i think that's a general a general

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,200
thing in software right now that

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,640
software actually touches the whole

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
society so

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,360
it's not it's not a thing that's hidden

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
anymore and so that's why also we have

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,600
to rethink a bit

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:04,480
about our responsibility in the world

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,320
so how do designer work well they have

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
different methods for example design

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,880
thinking

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
that you might have known or touched or

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,200
tried to gather

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:17,440
already but

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,799
in in our organization we have this

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,720
fantastic guy called

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,559
tom dayton and he used to work at the

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
nasa and

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:29,760
he used methods very similar to design

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
thinking for working with engineers and

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,360
project managers to actually

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,520
clearly define a requirement across a

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,320
broad set of organizations and

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,320
specialties

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
and he taught me the word collaborative

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,240
methods

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
and so i search a bit more about this

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,360
and this is very interesting

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
collaborative methods according to

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,640
wikipedia are the process behavior and

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
conversation that relate to the

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
collaboration

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
between individuals this method

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,200
specifically aimed to increase the

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
success of teams

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
as they engage in collaborative problem

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,720
solving

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
well this sounds very interesting this

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
is really

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,240
about bringing the whole team together

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,120
and having common decision

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,799
in a way that's the most effective that

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,640
brings the best results

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
without wasting too much time but at the

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,200
same time not letting

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
good things on the table

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
so what are the base principles to make

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,200
actually this work

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,840
well one of the things that first

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,080
everyone has an equal voice this is aim

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,400
at flattening the hierarchy

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,200
so of course you cannot change

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,919
everything

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,760
loud people will probably stay loud

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,840
quiet people will probably stay quite a

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
bit

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,480
but many of the processing methods and

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,240
collaborative methods are actually made

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,440
to

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,200
to to to drastically reduce those kind

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,760
of differences

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,520
also the facilitator has a big role to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,400
play in that

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,720
at helping this flattened hierarchy to

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
stay

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,960
but still mainly having those new

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,200
exercises those new way of work

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,320
that are not familiar to most of the

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
team members

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,679
it's usually a good way to reset a bit

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
the expectation so that's the first

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
thing

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
the next thing is that also ids should

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
be additive

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,400
means anyone's id account anyone's id

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,679
can be produced and put on the board

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,280
and if you disagree with an id just

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
write your own id

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
but don't try to talk down the the other

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
ids and again here the facilitator is

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,600
here to

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,679
prevent that kind of misbehavior and

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,799
with that context the flattened

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,840
hierarchy the

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,720
additivity of the ids you

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,039
create a very safe environment where

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,600
everyone can feel

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,600
safe to be creative and and propose

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,039
things that it wouldn't has proposed

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,039
in traditional meeting models

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,600
and so people contribute to a common

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
board artifacts or present the artifacts

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
on a regular basis so that

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,400
everyone knows about what the others are

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,960
doing on a permanent basis

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
that enables everyone to learn on each

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,320
other's

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,320
and so everyone can iterate much faster

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,159
because when you have 10 person

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,760
iterating at the same time and quickly

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
presenting what they have done

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,880
the learning effect in the team is way

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,360
faster than when you

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,400
wait just one day or even one week or

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,760
two weeks

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,120
as i see in some teams and finally

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,279
clustering and voting but

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:45,200
also other methods help selecting

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:47,919
the better ids and that really helps

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,640
alleviating the conflicts because when

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,520
an id

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,440
gets the clear maturity usually there is

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
no big discussion on that that this is

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
actually a valid point to to be brought

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,480
forward

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,880
or at least analyzed and validated to

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,640
the next step

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
so what are collaborative methods that

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
you can use well there are

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,320
quite quite a few of them and so this is

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,120
a very short list here but

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,960
look at design thinking for example i'm

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,919
personally very proficient with design

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
thinking

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,159
uh working with it for the past six

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,400
years it's it served me very well

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,919
and it's it's always great with teams

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
it's very positive oriented that's

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,760
probably

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,679
most of you know uh but

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
the name is a bit misleading it would be

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,840
actually more something like

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
collaborative id

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,919
thinking liberating structure

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,919
uh offers a wide range of exercise that

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
sometimes are pretty much different from

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
design thinking sometimes a bit more

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,039
similar

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,720
but they have also formats like

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,760
one-on-one interviews

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,799
and you know like a model for ids to

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,880
bubble up

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,919
as some kind of a one-on-one discussions

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,600
so it's really interesting as well and

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,559
lego serious play is also

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,039
a very fun and interesting maybe a bit

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,240
more oriented toward

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,600
team organization problems and so on

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,640
but still very interesting and i think

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,960
actually usable in a lot of different

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
ways

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,360
please don't call them workshops

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,640
workshops is it has some connotation and

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,200
especially one

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,799
that i think is detrimental is that it

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
make you think yeah you're going on this

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,240
maybe

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,000
i don't know one week retreat or so

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
and doing a workshop and then you're

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
done and this would be like saying that

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
you would work on your continuous

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,279
integration for

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,520
one sprint and then you you just let it

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,000
as is and and don't work on improving it

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
anymore

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,799
you will be leaving a lot of potential

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,840
on the table in that case

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,240
so my recommendation is you try to use

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,279
it

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,320
on a regular basis maybe i don't know

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,080
once or twice a week at least but in

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,120
small bursts of one to two hours so

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,880
people don't get burned out by it

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,400
because believe me when you are really

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
into such kind

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
of activities this is very demanding you

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,240
have to be fully there

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,720
and so many people are not used to that

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,159
you constantly have to to to analyze the

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
input of others and

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,200
and be creative so this is really

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
demanding very demanding

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,120
you can of course start with a short

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,400
workshop and it's always good for the

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,080
base education

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
for for getting the ball running at the

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,600
start and setting the right goals

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,880
but then a afterwards you should really

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,159
make it a process inside your team

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
so at ibm we actually use even uh design

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,120
thinking

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,039
for designing ai concepts we personally

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,360
in my team we used it for designing the

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,000
the overwatch

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,919
power ranking with ibm watson for

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,760
example

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,200
so this is a method that i know works

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,240
very well

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,919
and the advantage of that method is that

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
you bring everyone together and the

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,679
product managers the designers the data

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,720
scientists the developers the marketing

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,919
and you discuss together about

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,120
the feasibility the pro and cons of each

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,720
id and you try to be to be to be

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,200
creative and bold

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,559
and then bring it back to what's to

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
actually doable

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,640
and you also look at the ethical aspect

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,760
of the solution what could go wrong you

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,159
know what could be the

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,240
detrimental aspects for the user for the

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
business and also for the society as a

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,919
whole

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,520
so for me this this method is a great

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,960
guideline on how we could

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,520
build it out and actually use it for

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:53,200
all kind of responsible computing topic

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:57,360
so collaborative methods are still

00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:01,760
no magic i think they are very useful

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,919
they are a major tool and very important

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,200
but there are no magic for example they

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,360
highly depend on the

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
facilitator you have on board right

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,279
but still they will help you become a

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,880
responsible team

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,919
faster and how

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,080
actually by taking better decision

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,600
because they will look at the full

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,039
picture

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,159
in your own context so

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,559
you will really be able at designing and

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,120
crafting the best solution for you

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,640
what your team can actually accomplish

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,600
and will allow everyone

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,000
to look in the different dimension and

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,480
also those methods are very fun

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,360
so usually they improve the team spirits

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,640
and they allow everyone to have a voice

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,760
they allow the whole team to know who

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,720
whose strengths is in what area

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
and they improve the network inside the

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,320
team so very often it shortens the

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,159
communication path afterwards

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,080
and also the decision path in first

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,760
decision so

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,039
they have really good side benefits

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,440
so with that known i hope that you are

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,600
able now to make better progress on your

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,279
quest to become more responsible and

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:23,120
sustainable

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,120
