Description: 
	Current payment structures on the web are broken and unfair. 70% of digital ad spending go to two of the internetâ€™s highest traffic platforms, which leave out a large population of developers and content creators from making a meaningful profit from their work. Until recently the web did not have native payment functionality built into its DNA, inefficient advertising business models were able to blossom and have continued to bloom. Fortunately, the introduction of Interledger has made it possible to disrupt and equalize existing payment structures. By enabling a web browser to stream micropayments, the Interledger has helped pave the way for Web Monetization, a proposed W3C standard. This presentation will focus on how Web Monetization can help ensure developers and creators are compensated for their work via an open, native, efficient, and automatic way to transfer money on the web.
