	What is Open Source? - Tobie Langel, UnlockOpen

Open source is a deep part of software engineer culture. Yet we struggle to define it clearly. Depending on who you ask, open source is anything from a set of practices and norms to a simple software license. What arguably feels like a fairly pedantic discussion turns out to have real world impact. In the last couple of years, our community has been shaken by high profile projects adopting much more restrictive licenses, which some have started to call faux-pen source. This licensing shift isn't so unexpected when you consider it through the perspective of norms and practices rather than the fairly narrow one of licensing. Approaching open source through this broader and more intuitive lens gives us much better tools to understand the whole open source ecosystem, foster behaviors that are beneficial to its community, and consistently predict bad outcomes early. We should adopt it.

hi everyone my name is tobi lanzo i am a

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,279
consultant

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,280
that helps organizations create mutually

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,759
beneficial relationships with open

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,599
ecosystems

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
today i'd like to address one of the

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
most basic and yes

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
most fundamental question about open

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,960
source

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,279
simply what is open source

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
and i'd like to try and give a more

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
nuanced

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,880
answer to this question that we usually

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,520
hear

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
so there are two reasons that this came

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
up

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,200
the first is we've seen

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
a rise in ethical licensing over the

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
course of the last few years

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
it's being driven by open source

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
practitioners

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,079
who are concerned about how their

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,600
software is used

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,840
and also um we've seen a high

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,640
number of high profile open source

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,920
projects

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,040
move from open source licensing to

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
more restrictive licenses some still

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
open source like a gpl

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,680
and some that really fall out of the

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,240
scope of what is recognized

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,280
by the open source initiative as open

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
source licenses

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
this started a few years back with redis

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,240
then we had mongodb follow suit

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:31,040
more recently elastic and even more

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,040
recently grafana which moved to a gpl

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,920
so if you look up what open source

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,040
is you generally fairly quickly

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,320
end up on the website of the open source

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,640
initiative

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
looking at the open source definition

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,880
but what does the open source definition

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
actually describe

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
well it turns out that the open source

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,960
definition doesn't really define

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,720
open source actually it defines

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,599
what an open source license is

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,239
and as you can see this is fairly

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,800
different

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
right this is not just a rhetorical

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
issue

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,520
um it's not the same thing

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
and if we were in person and i was able

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
to ask

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,720
some of you here in the room

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
what are the features um how you would

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,040
define open source

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
you would probably say wildly different

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
things

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,239
then it's the license of the software

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
corresponds

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
to the open source definitions 10

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,599
criteria

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,319
for example you might talk about

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
the ability of contributing to an open

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
source project

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,599
or maybe the community aspect of the

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
project

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,400
the ability to work together the ability

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,680
to work in the open

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
the ability to learn in public the fact

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,640
that the software is just freely

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,800
available for anyone to use

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,400
the ability to learn from others to

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
network

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
all of the community aspects as you can

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,319
see

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,599
the definition is really broad and

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,480
different people

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,640
different constituencies in the open

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
source ecosystem

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
will have a different perspective and

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,440
think differently about what open source

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,440
is and what it means to them

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
so just looking at this we see fairly

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,599
quickly that

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
although the licensing aspects of open

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,959
source are important

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,480
there's a whole other set of aspects

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
that are important to people too

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,760
and it's interesting to

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
sort of like try to combine those in

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,080
order to

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
dig a bit deeper and if you really look

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
at what

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
all of these aspects are

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
they're really about the norms of open

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,199
source

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,400
on one side and the legal licensing

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
aspects on the other

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,680
so what is this going to look like in a

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,919
two by two full quadrant diagram

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,800
well let's simply put on the y-axis

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,960
whether the license of a project has

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,080
been certified

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,160
by the open source initiative and on the

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,600
x-axis let's put whether the project

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,639
follows or ignores typical

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
open source norms like the ones that we

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,919
discussed before

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,680
so we'll package in this horizontal

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,800
axis sort of all of what makes a project

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
feel open source the ability to be able

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
to contribute

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,600
the ability to be able to work together

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,000
on a project

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,600
etc and we'll

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,720
put only the licensing

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,400
aspects on the y-axis

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
so what does that give us well

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199
essentially um

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,880
any kind of project that has an open

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
source certified license

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,759
will be on the top two quadrants and

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,880
open source projects that follow norms

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,520
will be on the right two quadrants

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
so let's now dig in to each of those

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
quadrants

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,080
more specifically starting with the top

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,880
left quadrant this is

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
um the quadrant where you find projects

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,880
that

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,080
are open source in terms of their

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,319
license

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
but don't really abide by your typical

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,520
open source norms

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,120
um an example of this would be

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,479
for example the android software right

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,479
android is an open source project in

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,440
terms of its license

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,199
but from the perspective of all of the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
other aspects of open source that you

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
would expect for example that the

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,080
project

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,680
is built in the open or that it accepts

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,520
external contributions or at least

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
considers them

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,120
not to mention things like having an

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,479
open governance

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,960
um well that project doesn't meet any of

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,800
these

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
really the only thing that makes it open

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,599
source strictly speaking

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,199
is the fact that it has an open source

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,360
license

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,440
and so um i really like the fact that

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
some people have started talking about

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,840
this and

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
calling these projects nominally open

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,400
source

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:11,520
i sort of think of them as open source

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,520
and letter only not in spirit

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,160
um a lot of the open source projects the

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,800
high profile

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,680
projects that we talked about initially

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,039
were actually in this quadrant

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,759
and have moved

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,639
downwards towards the bottom left

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
quadrant

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,759
as they abandon strictly osi

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
certified licenses um in in favor of

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
licenses that

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,360
made it easier for their business model

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,879
or that's their claim and so this is the

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
second quadrant i'd like for us to

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,680
explore

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,840
which is the quadrant of um software

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,879
um whose um licenses are not open source

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
certified

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,599
and who ignore open source norms

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,360
and this has been dubbed

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,720
open source and for open source

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,440
um is essentially

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
on projects that sort of claim to be

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
open source

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,639
um from a licensing perspective but

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
aren't

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,319
and also really don't respect any of the

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
typical norms of open source that you

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,599
find and this

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,840
is really where you find a lot of the

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,840
um open source vendors

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,360
who are who really see

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
an open source essentially a marketing

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,120
tool we'll come back to this

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,959
so moving up to the top

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,560
right hand side corner what do we find

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
here we find

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
open source projects that are osi

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,120
certified

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,720
right and on that follow

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,600
open source norms this is really

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
the place where you want to be um and i

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
kind of call those community-driven open

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
source

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
but that's a bit restrictive there are

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
projects

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,560
in that space who are not community

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
driven

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,399
for example smaller open source projects

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
really belong in that space in terms of

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
following norms

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,720
and having an open source license but

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,959
are not

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
technically community driven essentially

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,800
because they're too small to be

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,640
community driven

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,680
but the spirit clearly is absolutely

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,120
there and um

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,920
going down from that third quadrant

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,640
right into the bottom right quadrant

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,560
this is an increasingly interesting

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,920
quadrant to me

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,279
why well because you find a lot of

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,480
projects in that space that respect and

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,480
follow open source norms

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,519
but who don't have an osi certified

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
license

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
and there might be a number of reasons

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
for this

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
what's really interesting to me is that

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,160
category is actually

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,760
um way broader right so i i talk about

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
this in terms of like the broader

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
ecosystem of open source

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,600
and i also think that in contrast with

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,200
software that is

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,519
open source and letter only um

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
software in that space is really open

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,120
source and spirit

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,519
right even if it doesn't necessarily

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,720
have an osi certified license

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,040
it really abides by these norms and i

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
think

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,480
if you really go at the very very bottom

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
of of that space you want to actually

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
find their

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,480
inner source right and what is inner

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,839
source well

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,320
inner source is um software that is

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,040
built

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,399
internally in a company or in an

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
organization

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
who is not open sourced in the strict

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
sensor doesn't have an osi

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
certified license cannot be used by

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,880
others

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,920
right but really is built using

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,519
open source practices

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,079
um and so you know and this bottom right

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
hand

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
quadrant you have sort of like this huge

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,399
spectrum

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,959
that goes from um software

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:22,160
that is for example

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,560
a cco license so public domain software

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
that

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,160
doesn't cannot be certified

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,760
by the osi for a number of reasons that

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,640
we're not going to get into today

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
um but that is extremely close to open

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
source

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,560
um in in every other way um all through

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,839
um all of the creative commons um

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
a lot of the creative commons for

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,000
example um um

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,680
the cc by non-commercial because of the

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
non-commercial restrictions

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
um cannot really fall um under the open

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,160
source

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,399
um label but are really close i mean

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,399
it's not code i understand but

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,839
from a a sort of norms and and and

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:07,680
spirit really feels be part of this

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,959
um build on uh remixing

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
uh culture that open source really has

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,959
fostered

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
and then um then you have all of the uh

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
ethical

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
source software which i'm increasingly

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,959
seeing

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:28,000
as open source that is focused around

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,120
maybe smaller communities that don't

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,160
necessarily

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
um want or desire that their software

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,320
goes

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,519
beyond those communities

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
and essentially want to be able to um

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
have some degree of control over how

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,000
that software is used

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
and going down all the way to inner

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
source where

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
it's really a software is really

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
protected by

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,160
um stays inside of an organization or

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
company

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,880
so to summarize and walk

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,399
back through the different categories

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,279
that we've defined

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,399
using that um two by two full quadrant

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,440
structure

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,160
um starting off where i started before

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
which is in the top left hand quadrant

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,120
um

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:24,639
where open source um is and letter only

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,480
um so some projects in that space

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,160
have a license that is certified by the

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,160
osi um

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,600
but they really don't follow the open

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,600
source norms at all

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,800
um it's really only about the license so

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,440
this is where you find

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,560
projects like android but it's this is

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
also where you find

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,880
a lot of those high prof profile

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
projects that have

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
moved to fopen source over the last few

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
years

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,199
like elasticsearch and mongodb were on

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
on this

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,199
in this top left quadrant uh beforehand

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,160
i.e

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,920
they had an open source license but they

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,519
really weren't abiding by the enormous

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,880
that much

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
another really common um thing that you

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,079
find in this

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:14,079
space is um open source projects where

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,480
um community the the the terms

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
don't apply the same way to the

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
community

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,560
as they do to the project um

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,399
vendor the original creator of the

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,360
project um so

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,040
you see this very often with gpl plus

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,680
cla

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,040
where the cla which is the contributor

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,320
license agreement

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,360
actually gives um

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,839
the original creator of the software

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
extra rights and essentially the right

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,279
to re-license that software

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
as they want and this is how a lot of

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,480
projects

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,320
um used to be um monetized in the past

00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:01,040
um where um the owner of the of the gpl

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:05,120
would actually sell non-gpl licenses

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,079
to their clients moving down

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
from that top left hand corner um you

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,519
move

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,720
to the bottom left and this is the

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,240
realm of open source right um this

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,440
is a software that really is there

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,320
because there are marketing um benefits

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,120
um for that software to sort of pretend

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
that it

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,680
looks a bit like um or osi certified

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
open source

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,199
but again here you will not find a much

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,720
in terms

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:40,320
of open source norms

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,600
moving to the um top right hand quadrant

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,600
this is um really um

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:51,040
what everyone thinks of and perceives

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,399
as being true open source software

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,440
an osi license on the one hand and

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,639
of real community open source

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,759
practices and norms probably an open

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,320
governance model

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
or if not um clearly

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,199
very open um contribution

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,199
uh system um so

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,160
the kind of open source software that we

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,120
all sort of know and really like

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,399
and moving down from that top left hand

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,800
corner um top

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,480
right hand quadrant sorry into that

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,279
bottom right hand quadrant

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
is the broader ecosystem of digital

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
commons

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,160
right um and this includes a lot of

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
creative common stuff

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,480
um ethical source and uh moving

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,839
even further down to some degree on

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,120
inner source

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,480
so essentially um software

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,040
um that is built um using

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,160
open source norms but doesn't

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,360
necessarily

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,079
have the osi certification once licensed

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
and so has some restrictions around

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,519
usage

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,519
which might be problematic for some use

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
cases but are perfectly acceptable for

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,919
others right

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,319
and this is a really open source in

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
spirit

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,679
all right so um still using the same

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,799
quadrant

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
i'd like to offer um a different

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,039
perspective

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,919
on this quadrant which is one that

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,120
focuses

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,160
not on the projects themselves but

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,960
actually on the different constituencies

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,120
that um

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,799
are part of the open source community

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,880
let's start with uh the user focus

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,240
so what's really interesting here is

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,280
the perspective of a user around open

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,799
source

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,400
um is really just to make sure from a

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,280
legal perspective

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
um that they comply the license and so

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
that the license

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,240
is actually a genuinely open source

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,760
license

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,200
because that makes compliance a lot

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,200
easier so the focus

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,360
of open source users

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,480
is really essentially the top

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,320
two quadrants um so the ones where the

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,080
software is certified

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,039
um and to some degree regardless

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,720
of whether the software actually abides

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,320
by

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,679
open source community norms or not

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,960
however savvy

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,320
users of open source will

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,520
um check and be wary

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,960
of um software that

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,080
doesn't um abide by open source norms

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,200
and there's two reasons for this one is

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,160
this can really be open source in the

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
making

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
so um typically if if you've been

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,799
betting on

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,360
for example elastic for european source

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,200
project

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
a number of years ago now you're

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,480
probably in the position where you're

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,840
not super sure what you have to do maybe

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,720
you want to rely on the

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,360
fork that amazon is maintaining so it's

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
a bit of a

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,160
um a complex situation that you probably

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,440
didn't want to be in

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,280
so um that is um one reason to

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
um tend to look at not only whether the

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,799
license

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
is um actually open source but make sure

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
that the community

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,120
um the community exists around the

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,480
software

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,280
um and that um the culture of the the

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
project

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,799
really is an open source one and of

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,480
course

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:51,520
the other reason to do this is

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,200
um really from a

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,200
um a sustainability

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,880
long-term health perspective of the

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,480
project right

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,760
if a project has a sustainable

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,679
um multi-um

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,880
user governance model etc it is a lot

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,480
easier it's um you know

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,280
much better position to participate to

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,520
this project

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
fix the things you care about but also

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,520
make sure that the project

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,919
is still going to be there in two three

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,600
four

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,720
five six years um so

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,080
really the user perspective focuses

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,280
on the license um absolutely

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,320
um and and but also

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,320
savvy users focus on norms

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,760
now if we look at open source

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
contributors well their perspective is

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
fairly different

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,640
right because they're much more

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
interested about what the community

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,760
looks like i mean

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,440
lots of people don't mind

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,039
using the beer license or the what

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,039
wtf license sorry

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,679
and why because what matters to them

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,559
is the contributing aspect the community

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,679
aspect of respecting the norms aspect

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,880
and so really you will find these

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,559
um contributors caring

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,720
more about um norms than they will

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,480
about licenses

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,240
and now i'd like to look at the last

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,919
constituency that we're going to look at

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,880
today

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,480
um and these are software vendors and

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,840
while software vendors are kind of all

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,240
over the quadrants

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,280
uh you will find some in every one of

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,760
those quadrants

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,559
um and what so what's really interesting

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,679
is to

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,559
understand how their perspective differs

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,200
and kind of

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
how they're thinking about open source

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
um

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,960
in each of those different quadrants so

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,720
again in the top left quadrant

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,640
vendors are building software that has

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,080
an open source license

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
but the open source aspect is there is

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,840
more of a

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:20,000
marketing gimmick to some degree um

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,600
than really a reason to build

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,640
a strong software together and so

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,240
when project slide from having a

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
northside certified

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,240
uh licensed to having an um a non-osi

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,200
certified license their perspectives uh

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,280
changes from

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
open source is great for marketing to

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
open is great for marketing right

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
so that's kind of where the perspective

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,400
is that

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,440
contrasts quite a bit um

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,880
with projects that see

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,320
open source not so much as a marketing

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,760
strategy but

00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,480
as an engine to build

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,480
really great software um for me the

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,480
canonical example of this

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,679
is of course red hat which really

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,720
sees its upstream open source as

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,840
um um

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,880
a wonderful place to build great

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,919
software

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,200
and its role not so much as selling on

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,240
that software

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,320
but at making it um really

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,679
easy for their clients to be able to use

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,799
that software

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,240
well for their projects

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,280
um and so in that space um

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,559
really the perspective is

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,240
open source is a great way to build

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:50,480
software so that's in the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:54,080
top right hand so this is osi certified

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,440
combined with um abiding by

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,080
open source norms or i mean i should say

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
leveraging open source norms to build

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,039
fantastic software

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,480
and so bottom um right

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,520
well a lot of players in that field

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,520
um actually

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
aren't players that really care about

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,640
open source

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,640
but find it really hard to monetize or

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,799
just concerned about monetizing open

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,120
source software in that space

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,320
but just don't come from that culture so

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,799
for example

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,080
github when it started um i mean still

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
not open source today but when it

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
started

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,640
really sort of felt like it was in that

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,159
bottom right hand

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,760
culture which is um open source is great

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,640
you want to open source as much as you

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
want

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,159
but if you open source too much or if

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
you open source your whole product it's

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,039
going to be really hard to monetize it

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,799
and so instead you should essentially be

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,000
um open sourcing

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,679
um sort of the infrastructure or the

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,799
pieces that made

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,320
um building what you're building um easy

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,000
to do

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,200
so this is um the perspective

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,320
from um vendors

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,919
right um so you see uh

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,120
moving from a culture where open source

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,320
is a marketing

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,960
um strategy to a culture where open

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,000
source

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,960
is really how you build um

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
great software and then wondering about

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,840
how to monetize

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
open source in that space

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
all right so to conclude this

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,880
presentation

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,960
really what i wanted to show to show you

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,919
today was

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,320
that open source is a lot more than just

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,520
um

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,919
its uh license um and this is something

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
that that's a feeling that we all in

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,840
intimately have

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,000
um and i really want to validate this

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,480
feeling

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
open source is about community open

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,440
source

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,720
is about open source norms it's about

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,960
um a shared sense of purpose it's about

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,640
all of these things

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,919
and it's extremely important not to

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,039
um reduce open source to

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,240
just the license um um

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,080
and not only for these uh

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,080
some of the very personal reasons but

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:31,200
also for the business aspects of this

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,919
because um when you stop considering

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
open source more globally and just

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,120
consider the licensing aspects

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,919
you start missing um signals that a

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,039
project is

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,360
actually on a trajectory uh or at least

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,640
on a potential trajectory to becoming

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,080
phobian source

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,279
and and creating a world of hurt uh

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,360
for um companies uh

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,240
developers projects that have been

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,039
building on top of it

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
so um there are really good signals that

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,520
you can pick

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,120
a pick on um

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,559
to avoid putting yourself in that

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,720
situation or

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
at least if you really have to rely on a

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
project that is

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,320
risky from a community health

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,240
perspective do so knowingly

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,080
and these signals are essentially around

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,840
those typical norms that we talk about

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
like is it easy to contribute to that

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,159
project

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,799
um is the the maintainers

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,080
um all from one company is there an open

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,200
governance model

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,880
is the project in a foundation

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,200
or is it really controlled by a company

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,279
um what about the trademarks is there

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
like a lot of confusion between the name

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,840
of a company

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,000
uh that's behind the project and the

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,919
project itself all of these

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,039
are red flags um if if you see those

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,159
thread carefully because um you might

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,000
very well put yourself in harm's way

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,840
in um the mid-term

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,480
right um but to end on a more positive

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,679
note

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,440
i think it's um this exercise is also

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,399
really valuable because

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,200
it shows that one of the key aspects of

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,240
open source

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,360
or all of the community norms aspect

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,799
this is what creates this really high

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,279
quality software

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,399
that we all care about and those same

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,240
practices

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,279
um the the same spirit of open source

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,799
can be used elsewhere elsewhere to great

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,440
success

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,440
whether that is inside of a company i'll

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,279
call it inner source if you want to

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,799
or in projects that are more restricted

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,640
in terms of

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,200
who is able to use them uh for example

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
cc by non-commercial or ethical source

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,559
licenses

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,159
um but still really carry the spirit of

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,200
open source

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,559
because it's the spirit it's these

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,679
um community aspects um

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:11,120
that we really

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,520
um see value in personally and that are

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,039
also extremely valuable in order to

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,159
create um software that is um of

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,520
really great quality so

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,440
thank you so much for your time and uh

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,000
i'm happy to take questions one more

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,240
questions now

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,760
and and to hear your comments about

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,559
this sort of more nuanced answer to the

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,840
question of

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,840
