	Panel: Node.js Package Maintenance Working Group: Year 3 - Glenn Hinks, American Express; Bethany Griggs, Red Hat; Darcy Clarke, Github; Dominykas Blyze, NearForm; Rodion Abdurakhimov, Aspire Global 

It is a challenge to ensure that key Node.js ecosystem modules are maintained, safe, and up to date. The resulting pain is felt by both the users of the modules, and the module authors and maintainers. The Node.js Package Maintenance Working Group was initiated in 2018 to bring together users, authors, and maintainers to work towards solutions for these challenges. This talk will showcase the working groupâ€™s current focuses, guidance, and tooling three years on.
