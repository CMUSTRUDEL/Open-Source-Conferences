Description: 
	Panel: Node.js Package Maintenance Working Group: Year 3 - Glenn Hinks, American Express; Bethany Griggs, Red Hat; Darcy Clarke, Github; Dominykas Blyze, NearForm; Rodion Abdurakhimov, Aspire Global 

It is a challenge to ensure that key Node.js ecosystem modules are maintained, safe, and up to date. The resulting pain is felt by both the users of the modules, and the module authors and maintainers. The Node.js Package Maintenance Working Group was initiated in 2018 to bring together users, authors, and maintainers to work towards solutions for these challenges. This talk will showcase the working groupâ€™s current focuses, guidance, and tooling three years on.

welcome to package maintenance team

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,240
working group

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
year three panel discussion my name is

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
uh glenn hinks now i'd like to start off

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,519
by just introducing

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,000
uh the package maintenance working team

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,160
so the health of the javascript module

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,080
ecosystem in part depends upon the

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,039
ability of the community to

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,800
maintain the core packages within it the

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,680
package maintenance team

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
is addressing these issues these issues

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,439
of long-term maintenance goals

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,079
by offering a place for maintenance

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,120
advice some tooling development

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
assistance to struggling maintainers and

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,840
guidance

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
to folks that depend upon seemingly

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,559
unmaintained modules

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
our goal is to aid the maintenance and

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
health

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
of this software ecosystem i'd like to

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
start off by

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239

that i'd just like to say the the

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,039
opinions expressed in this talk

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
are our own and not necessarily those of

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280

recently acquired last year i'm

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
pretty active in the node community and

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,159
open source

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,239
javascript community helping out with

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,159
opengs efforts

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,280
as well as the node projects wherever i

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,040
can and collaborating with folks here

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
in the package maintenance working group

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,319
as well as the tooling working group

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
and yeah it's a little bit about me

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
thank you very much darcy and my name is

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,400
glenn hinks i work for american express

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,000
i work for the acquisitions division

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,480
and i am mostly a node developer

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
previously no developer we're very much

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,959
a javascript shop and we're very

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,400
interested in the long term health

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,879
of our ecosystems

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,159
i'd like to start off by asking bethany

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,680
to give us a little bit of an

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,799
introduction into the history of the

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
package maintenance team

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
yeah so the package maintenance team was

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
kicked off

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,600
as a result of the call to action back

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,519
in uh 2018 it was actually kicked off at

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,320
the node summit conference

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,240
and at the time it was just after like

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,120
there was already widespread adoption

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
of node.js in the enterprise that was

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
we're reaching a

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
very large number of mpm modules out in

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
the ecosystem

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
and a few folks have found that there

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
were still

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
kind of like barriers to adopting the

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
ecosystem the module ecosystem in the

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
enterprise

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
and this was particularly around like

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
how much choice there was

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,360
and concerns around ongoing maintenance

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,960
and

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,680
support of the ecosystem modules

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
so the team was was announced to get

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
together

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
a bunch of folks who wanted to work on

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
the challenges around

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
module ecosystem adoption with that

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
enterprise focus

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,520
um and this was also stand because at

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,720
the time there were a lot of widely used

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,240
modules

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
that weren't necessarily getting the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
maintenance and

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
um support that was needed um when you

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,479
look at how wide

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,360
properly how wide widely they were used

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,280
and so the team got together then and

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
since then we've been getting together

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
probably every couple of weeks to talk

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
about various challenges

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
and the early the early kind of work was

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
around producing some best practice

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
documentation for module maintainers to

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
follow

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,560
um particularly to help

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,440
bridge the mismatching expectations some

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
folks may have

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,720
between consuming and maintaining

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
modules

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
and and then from there the project

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
started to get um

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
talk about more challenges we found a

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
need to produce some tooling to help

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,440
support

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
and know module maintainers and we're

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
we're still continuing we're still

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,120
talking about new issues

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,680
and building more tooling and figuring

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,919
out how we can help out

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199
thank you very much bethany that's an

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
introduction

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,479
for the team as a whole but what i'd

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,000
like to do is ask

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,680
each member of this panel what are the

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
motivations and the state of the

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
ecosystem

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
from their particular spec perspectives

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,440
as they look in

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,360
at the work of the package maintenance

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,080
team i'd like to start with

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
dominicus

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
uh yeah so

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,840
node's ecosystem is huge right and uh

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
there's a very broad

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,639
spectrum of things happening there um i

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,440
think

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
there's uh from my personal perspective

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
is

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
is my personal interest is to kind of

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639
have

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
uh kind of be able to sleep at night

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
uh quietly knowing that you know the

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,360
modules that we're using

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,919
are high quality and are

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,880
well maintained um i i have a particular

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,240
interest in tooling

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,240
and in ci tooling uh which

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
uh you know been up i've been observing

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
the ecosystem

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,160
how it acts in that regard i think

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,960
we have it really nice in node.js land

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
because mostly we have a very well

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,240
standardized

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
approach to you know how you do tests

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199
for

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
how you run tests for various modules

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
right that you're using

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,599
um if there's npm test as a shortcut and

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,120
uh

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,759
for a very long time we had a very

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
nice open source initiative from travis

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,240
where pretty much everybody used the

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919
same setup

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,800
in ci as well um so

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,000
yeah just watching out for modules to be

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
up to date and uh

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
there was there was also the case that

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,440
around the time that this group started

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,479
there was the uh eslint scope uh

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,919
issue uh security problem

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,520
and you know there's there's people

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,960
moving on there's packages being

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,199
abandoned but they're still

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
getting a lot of use so in terms of

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,440
overall health

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,319
i just want you know for the customers

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
uh to deliver the proper experience and

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720
you know the quality

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,879
modules that they can use

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
thank you dominicus yes everyone has

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,400
their own special

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
interests and perspective upon the work

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
we do

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,639
but we all know it impacts all of us in

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
so many ways

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
rhodium what are your views on the

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,159
current state of the

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,320
ecosystem and your motivation for taking

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,599
part in the package maintenance team

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,399
yeah we all know that companies that

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,640
build a big enterprise level application

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
they desire to depend on the

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
stable maintainable packages with

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,959
predictable releases

00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,480
and smooth node.js version upgrades so

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:04,000
unfortunately we see the situation that

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,399
some critical for the ecosystem packages

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
may not receive required level of

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,080
support

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
because of increased popularity of the

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,040
package

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,920
but in the same time initial

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
maintainers were not reinforced with

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,560
relative

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
manpower to deal with a growing amount

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,240
of

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,720
issues so from my side

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,640
it will be great if companies will start

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,920
to invest

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:39,120
more efforts in support from their side

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,920
in packages that they depend on and

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
that's why our team was created to

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,440
reduce this gap

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,080
between package maintainers and

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
consumers

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,760
thank you rhodium that's very

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
interesting and that's a very common

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,120
view i feel from many people

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,839
the concern about the sheer size what

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,839
happens as people that initiate modules

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,720
and hand off to maintainers what happens

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,360
next

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,279
it is such a vast system and i'm not

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
sure that this really has happened on

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,760
this scale before

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,600
bethany what do you think about the

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,800
current state of the ecosystem and your

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
motivation for

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
participating in a package maintenance

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,560
team

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
yeah one one particular thing is the the

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
widespread choice

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,240
you know with like so many million

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,200
modules to choose from knowing what's a

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,519
good choice

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
and particularly i came from i first

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
started using node when i was at

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
university where i would just look for a

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
package use it and

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
i was like yes this does the job um but

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,720
then joining

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,360
a large corporate company like ibm and

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,480
where we've got lots of folks using node

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
and learning how large organization and

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
enterprise deals with this

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,760
massive choice and that was a big

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,120
learning curve for me and actually

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
sparked a lot of interest

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,320
um in for example the concerns around

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,839
like licenses maintenance

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,480
um what what actually makes a module

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
um supported and maintained enough for

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
you to be willing to stand

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,600
like stand your whole production

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
application on top of it and so that

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
that's really where a lot of my interest

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,040
comes from and why i like getting

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,880
involved because trying to

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,720
trying to figure out how we can

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,440
encourage responsible consumption of

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,360
modules

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
and how to help people choose them

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,440
yes so that is one of the the you you've

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,120
hit a now on my head there are so many

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
to choose from which ones we choose

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,600
there might be five or six that do the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
same thing

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
they might seem equally as popular which

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ones are being maintained

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
how do we know which ones are maintained

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
um

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
you know do we just use the one that has

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
the best readme that's the sort of thing

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,880
we see what this one looks like

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,440
it's the easiest to use um and we may

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600
find

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
down the road that it might not be have

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,160
been the best choice

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,040
so now we're going to talk to dars who

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,000
actually works

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
at npm for his perspective of the

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
current state of the ecosystem and his

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,480
motivation

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,120
for participating in a package

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,720
maintenance team

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,360
thanks glenn um yeah so my original

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,399
involvement was is bit selfish obviously

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
trying to

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,519
stay up to date with other folks in the

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
ecosystem

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,639
and and also trying to hopefully bring

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
discussions

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,560
into a form that is sort of uh neutral

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,079
a neutral form i really like what we've

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
done here with this group

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,160
um from npm's perspective in terms of

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,920
the ecosystem and how it's

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,240
changing evolving we can continue to see

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,839
exponential growth that might not be

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
surprising of folks on this

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
group but we continue to see exponential

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
growth in terms of

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,079
downloads of packages consumption of

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,240
packages

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,040
um in october we hit 100 billion

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,040
monthly downloads uh from the registry

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
the npm registry which is an amazing

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,800
milestone as an ecosystem

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,839
um this uh you know was marked also at

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
the 11-year

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
anniversary of the npm cli so right

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
around the same time we hit about 100

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,920
billion downloads

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,720
so that's that's 11 years and and we

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,360
finally hit that

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,839
milestone uh surprising enough this past

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,079
month we just hit 123 billion downloads

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,800
so you can see that exponential growth

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,000
just continues to climb uh and in terms

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
of the registry the things that are

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,560
actually on

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,600
uh you know and pm uh we have 1.6

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,959
million packages

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
now as of 2021 and uh if you look at the

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,560
numbers

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,920
uh from also github's side who also is

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,720
helping to track things

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,480
their recent uh stats from octoverse or

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
our state of the octoverse or state of

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
the

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,760
repositories that live on on github

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
we saw that javascript continues to be

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
the number one platform in the world for

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,480
for

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
in terms of programming languages and

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,440
typescript is quickly jumping up there

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
as well

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,839
uh hitting you know number four uh in

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,720
terms of of languages

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
uh just behind python and java in terms

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
of

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,880
the state of those projects 94

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
of the javascript projects rely on open

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,959
source

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
they rely on other open source

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,279
dependencies and the median

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,040
uh transitive dependencies is 683.

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,800
if you compare that to other languages

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,350
python is

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
819 roughly 19 median

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,839
[Music]

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,120
transitive dependencies ruby 68 and php

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,360
is 70 the closest to

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,279
you know node and javascript projects so

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,320
that's pretty interesting in terms of

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,040
the growth

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,880
uh and sort of the network that we're

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,079
establishing here as an ecosystem

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,199
and sharing uh projects with each other

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,800
um it's a big web and we're all working

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,760
together hopefully to strengthen

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,760
you know our projects

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
thank you darcy and it is interesting to

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,560
note that sometimes we

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,880
have a let's say a selfish

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,800
self-interest from a perspective that we

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,760
have but that interest actually

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
serves the wider community because

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
funnily enough we all

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
have that same interest we want our

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,440
thing

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,279
to be maintained and to be stable

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,959
but the only way to get our thing to be

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,199
maintained is to do it at a much

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,040
larger level because as you say we have

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
so many dependencies and now

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,800
all open source majority of them um

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
maintained by

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,920
volunteers in in the community so i'd

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,720
like to give my perspective

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
on this ecosystem so i'm going to take a

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,920
little bit of a bigger perspective

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,440
step back a little bit um so i must say

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,639
there was a time when the javascript

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,680
ecosystem was

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,120
actually perceived as not the realm of

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,720
serious programmers

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,959
or real development um that time has

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
long since passed as darcy has said you

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,320
just got to look at the size of it

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,399
it is now the largest ecosystem and the

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,600
barriers to entry are very

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,800
very low very low indeed compared to

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,320
other ecosystems you do not need

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,040
years of experience to make a really big

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,120
positive contribution and this makes it

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
a very inviting community and i look at

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
it and i can see people with only one

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,800
year's

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,279
experience making packages pushing them

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,079
out

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,279
and they're being adopted however i see

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,399
also see

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,399
from everything we said there's a

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,720
downside to a large ecosystem

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,480
we have the most uh dependencies

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,680
transitive dependencies

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,360
and we do see common modules becoming

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,240
less commonly used and as ideas change

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,079
we the common models might change and

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
this is good the ecosystem we're pushing

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,720
this ecosystem forwards

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
however there's a basic underpinning of

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,079
the

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,079
ecosystem um the underpinning actually

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,320
comes from commercial companies

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,920
they pay for us to go to work and do

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,560
stuff and although we use this

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
this thing they have revenue generating

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
sites

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,360
that often depend upon these maintained

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,439
pieces of code and sometimes

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
some modules get superseded by others

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
and these modules that they depend upon

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
are now

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
unmaintained and when we say

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
unmaintained there are different types

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
of

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,199
unmaintained somebody may not have time

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,160
somebody may have essentially ghosted a

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
module and have

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,760
moved on there may be family events that

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,640
have happened

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
and i view this as a chance to actually

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,919
for people to come

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,840
to a a small team and say

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
there's this module it has many

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
downloads many people are dependent upon

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
it

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
i i can't contact maintainers or they're

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
not responding

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,679
what should we do and i think this is

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,559
the first time

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,000
as an ecosystem and i originally was

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,000
looking into the ecosystem

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
from the outside before i joined it and

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
when i was on the inside i realized it

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
was much bigger

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
on the inside than the outside meaning i

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,919
realized

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,799
what it was we're the the first point of

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,120
call i think

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
that's been set up for this actual

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,559
long-term

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
health of the ecosystem so that's what

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
my

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
mine is also selfish i want things i use

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
to be maintained

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
and the only way to do that is to do

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,520
that at this sort of

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
uh larger level so i'd like to thank

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,120
everyone

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,240
um for that taking given us their

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,280
perspectives

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,880
on this particular ecosystem

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,640
i'd like to go into some of the things

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
we've actually done in the package

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
maintenance team i'd like to go to the

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,280
early days this is a three-year look

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
back

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,640
when we first started um obviously

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,480
you know there's lots of interest when a

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
team is first kicked off

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,799
we we are looking to see what our our

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,720
remit was what were we doing

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,640
and we actually started with

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,880
documentation

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
so with many projects the initial phases

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
are characterized by

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,440
long open discussions and we were no

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,679
different we had long open discussions

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
uh we are composed with participants

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
from many time zones

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,240
and our initial goals was to establish

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
via debate

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,799
what we wanted to achieve so we started

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,440
writing things down

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
and some of the the first things we we

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
wrote down

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,760
were really basic things like

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
what license should you have and we

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
looked at licensing

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,440
we actually contacted npm and we said

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,200
what are the most popular licenses and

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,160
they provided us with a nice ordered

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,960
list

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
and from that we made some judgment

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
calls

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,919
and said okay these are the commonly

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
used ones we recommend you should have a

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,520
license we wrote it down

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,640
at that time it was still very early we

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
weren't sure

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,000
how much or how big a remit we had

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
so we started writing down other things

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,640
we wrote down

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,440
what we thought about testing we came up

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,160
with a governance model for our team

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,840
it was very much about starting off and

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
we weren't quite sure

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
what the entire remit was we knew what

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,840
the problem was but how should we go

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
about

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
solving it so we started off by writing

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,799
things down

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,960
but we soon realized what our our role

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,320
was was as a place

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,559
that could be engaged by mostly

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,799
well-known people within the community

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,840
that had an issue with a module they

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,240
would come along

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,000
and they would say this module has this

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,400
many downloads and often there were many

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
weren't they darcy many millions and it

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,600
appears to be unmaintained

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,240
or at least non-respondent in github

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,080
and we wanted to become a place where we

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
could provide some guidance somebody

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,480
could come to us and we could say

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
yes we will contact them we will say who

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,159
we are are you maintained are you not

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
maintained and we would wait

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,240
we pri provides some sort of guidance to

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,000
users it's not just a case of

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,919
maintainers there's also the users of

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,520
those modules

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,760
and then of course this leads into

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,919
what we should do when we actually have

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,200
to support things so

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,919
i'm now going to ask rhodium about the

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,120
package support tool um what does

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,559
support mean to you

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,600
and why is it valuable rhodium

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,559
yes so as a working group we committed

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,280
to

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:20,159
work on processes and tools and tools

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,240
that may reduce the gap between package

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,360
maintainers and

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,600
consumers in terms of expectations

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,679
so it was decided to document a process

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,760
of how package maintainers can

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,840
communicate the level of support they

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,159
are going to

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,200
to provide for the package that they

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,120
create

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,720
and we created a specification

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,280
called package support which describes

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,720
uh how package maintainer can specify

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,159
target version of

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,440
node.js they will to they will support

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,480
and

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,720
how quickly maintainer will respond to

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:06,080
issues and the bacon so how

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,280
package is supported and how consumers

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,799
may help support the package

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,919
and based on this specification we

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,960
created the tool

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,600
called support

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,720
that will help maintainers to create and

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,679
validate the structured support

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
information for their packages and this

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,120
tool also

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,799
can read support information in

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,600
dependencies three

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,400
of the projects so i definitely

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,640
recommend

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,919
everybody to check out

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,120
pkg.js support repo and

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:51,200
start adding support

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,200
information in your packages

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,720
thank you rojan and i'm going to

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
continue this discussion

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,600
we've we just had about support by

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,640
asking the other members of the panel

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,080
how much support do you think uh users

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
should be getting and

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,640
do you think that they've become a

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,799
little bit spoilt after all

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,320
most of these modules are maintained by

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,200
volunteers

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
and we always enter into these things

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,840
very

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,520
you know bright eyed but after a few

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,679
years of maintaining something

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,280
you may become a victim of your own

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,840
success

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,799
do we think that do we see that very

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,799
much in the community

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,960
i can answer the first question right as

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,840
a user of a package you should expect

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,200
zero support

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,240
right that's that's the reality of this

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,720
um i think there's uh

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,760
a lot of ethics of open source to be

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
communicated

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:55,600
to a lot of people um

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,600
on the other hand there is

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,960
a certain expectation i guess between

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
the people that

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,200
overall the community would step up to

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,760
fix major issues and i think

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
this has happened i think there's a

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,080
bunch of

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,200
uh really well known and widely used

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,919
packages

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
that have not necessarily exactly

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,600
changed hands

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,720
uh over the past you know few years even

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,720
even last year

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,799
um that have been receiving security

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,440
reports vulnerabilities cds

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,400
uh that have been getting addressed uh

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,880
and i think that

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
overall as long as you know you're

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
picking your

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,360
modules carefully the community has been

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,880
providing that

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,279
support to to kind of

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,200
not necessarily guarantees but a certain

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,200
baseline of support where

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,440
issues are getting addressed in a timely

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,240
manner in critical packages

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,240
overall right

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,320
yes it's a it's a very interesting thing

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,880
on the face of it

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,720
we're kind of offering an ecosystem

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,200
however

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
currently we're not guaranteeing any

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
levels

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,000
of support and i think many of us on

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
this panel

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
are always amused by the things we read

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,960
in github

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
and the demands that are made upon

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
maintainers who have given their time

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
freely

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,120
that they should provide features or

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,159
services

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,159
uh to people

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,440
part of this team's remit is to try and

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,840
make this process

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
a a bit better

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:37,200
what we've found is if we provide

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,480
a tool that specifies maintenance levels

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,520
then we may have some

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,760
expectations relieve stress on users

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,039
and on maintainers too if it's

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,320
unsupported

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,279
you know they'll get there when they can

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,840
however we do have some modules within

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,320
the ecosystem

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,960
that essentially people do maintain

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,360
and we've actually been developing a

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
tool

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,080
called webby for this

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,640
and i would like to call on uh

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,919
dominicus to talk a little bit about

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,799
what wibby is

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:20,159
and why we think we need this tool

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,960
yeah uh so webby is a bit of an

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
experiment

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,440
i guess there is an overall need

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,760
uh to have a gener a generic tool

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,039
in the ecosystem uh that would be

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,440
similar to

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,480
the scanner in the gold mine tool that's

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,520
available for

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,320
node.js itself whereby uh

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,000
there's nightly builds of node or

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
prerelease cat release candidates of

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,080
node.js

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,520
uh are getting tested against uh the

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
modules in the ecosystem

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
that node.js doesn't break these modules

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,320
and now because we have a very large

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,159
ecosystem

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,080
there's lots of interdependencies

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,360
between modules right one thing depends

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,880
on on another

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,520
and that means that as a maintainer who

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
does provide a level of support to their

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,039
package

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,720
or even just you know uh purely out of

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
selfish interests they're building the

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,960
tool and don't want to brill

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,159
to break other tools uh that they may be

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,840
using themselves

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:20,399
uh because of this uh deep and wide

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
dependency trees that we have in node.js

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
ecosystem

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,799
you want a tool which allows you to test

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,440
that whatever you're building

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,880
does not break your dependence so wibby

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,080
is an attempt at that

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
there have been similar tools in the

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,039
past i think there's some still

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,320
available

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,520
uh what will be does differently is um

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,520
and i guess that's the tricky part and

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,559
that's the experiment part right to see

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,840
if it works

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,440
um is instead of

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
downloading the packages and running

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
their tests locally

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,960
it opens pull requests or pushes

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,520
branches

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,039
into the package repositories of

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,679
dependents

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,960
which allows these tests to actually run

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,480
in the ci environment

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,720
of that package the way it is set up so

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
as i mentioned we we have mostly

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,039
standardized

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,880
in uh node.js ecosystem to

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,440
basically you can test any package using

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
npm test however if you do that locally

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,159
that's probably going to run

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,000
in the node.js version that you have

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,039
installed locally whereas most of the

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,360
packages

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,960
would probably be testing against

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,919
multiple would be targeting multiple

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,080
versions of node

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,080
right so you could have i guess 10 is

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,960
how is it out yet yeah it's probably out

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,200
of support yet

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
at this point but if you have if you're

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
supporting 12 14 and 16

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
and you start to use new features you

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
could be breaking something in node 14

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,640
so you want to test the whole

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,440
run the whole suite the whole system uh

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,480
of tests

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,039
uh with the changes that you're making

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,799
so webby tries to do that and yeah it's

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,840
very much still in progress there's a

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,760
couple

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
of unsolved issues but we're moving

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,760
there and we'll see

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
how that goes right i'm very interested

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,320
to start using it in

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,559
in in real life against real packages

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,440
uh against real i guess plug-in

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,679
ecosystems

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,279
uh and we're we're getting really close

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,440
to be able to do that so

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,640
yeah looking for volunteers to test that

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,279
as well

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,320
yes i'm i'm super excited to start uh

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,799
using the tool

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,919
too so thank you thank you very much i'm

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,720
going to move on to

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,000
darcy now to talk about vulnerabilities

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,840
because

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,559
we all know that vulnerabilities cause

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,799
problems and

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,720
nothing freaks out the enterprise more

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,919
than a vulnerability report

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,080
darcy would you like to comment yeah

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,200
so this is another area in which this

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,640
group was

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,039
uh speaking to security for quite a

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,840
while

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,679
trying to ideate on um different

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
initiatives that we could kick off and

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,600
and figure out how we could get involved

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,679
and and make some recommendations

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,720
along the lines of sort of the supports

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,360
uh json spec that sort of came came

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,360
out of that work and so myself and

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
wesley todd have become the co-champions

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,960
of a new

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,240
um collaboration space in the open.js

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
foundation

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,520
it's the first ever it's called the uh

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
package

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,039
uh let me get the name right it's very

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
long

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,200
package vulnerability management and

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,919
reporting collaboration space

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,600
um and we'll be kicking off essentially

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,880
the first

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,559
session there at at this conference and

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,919
and we'll be talking a little bit more

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
about what we're hoping to

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,000
achieve with that uh group um the idea

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,679
being that

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
we would like to improve the cve

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
reporting and sort of resolution

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,279
workflows that we see today

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,200
um going back to some of the data that i

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,080
i gave before from

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,039
the github state of the octoverse we see

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,840
roughly

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,679
59 of those

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,960
683 transitive dependencies

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,559
um they're up to 59 of them are going to

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,279
get a security alert

00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,840
um within a year of them being active on

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,880
in a

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,559
in a project um so that's that's almost

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
almost a certainty is what we see in the

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,200
data that there's going to be some sort

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,919
of alert come

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,120
by with one of your dependencies and we

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,000
see roughly

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,039
17 of those vulnerabilities that are

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,120
actually filed

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,480
are explicitly militias whereas the

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,120
other 83

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,120
are actually results of mistakes so

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,919
we're trying to like reduce the churn

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,679
and we want to

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,600
essentially bring together security

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,279
researchers

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,880
and organizations with package

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,600
maintainers and

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,399
and tooling authors like like ourselves

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,559
at npm to try to reduce this burden

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,440
and reduce the noise so that we improve

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,600
the tooling and

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,679
secure the ecosystem more so that's the

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,440
idea behind putting together this

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
collaboration space

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,120
and we're working with folks that have

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,159
already been working this space for

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,919
a while and yeah we're hoping that the

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,480
outcomes of that work will be

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,880
you know improved tooling and

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,000
potentially even auditing tooling

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,600
for for the ecosystem as a whole

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,600
so that's a little bit about what we're

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,679
doing that space and that was

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,600
spun out of this group which which is an

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,240
amazing and exciting uh

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,919
initiative yeah it is quite amazing to

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,440
think we've spun off some children

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,480
uh from from the team um and no one

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,720
takes security lightly and you know

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,039
for the health of the ecosystem and its

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,159
adoption within the enterprise this is a

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,159
serious thing

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,600
and it's good to have a place to go that

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,840
we could point those

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,360
organizations to and go we take this

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,240
seriously as well

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
so i'd like to get back to bethany and

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,600
have a talk

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,360
about um what she thinks the greatest

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,240
um achievements for the package

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,200
maintenance team is so far

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,720
sure so um i think great achievements

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
include like the documentation we

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,320
produce

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,679
the tooling um and like

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,519
getting to know the other package

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,399
maintainers but i do think the key

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,640
achievement

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,360
and outcome of this working group is

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,360
that we have provided a neutral space

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,799
where we bring together package

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,080
maintainers

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,880
uh consumers authors and also

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,039
um from various parts of the ecosystem

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,799
so we have the folks from npm we have

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,039
people who are active within node

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,519
project and so bringing all of these

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,120
people

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,320
together to try and figure out the

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,080
problems i think that's probably the

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,240
greatest achievement because we're

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,080
we're then satisfying everyone's needs

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,399
and challenges rather than just like

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,039
a subset of the the uh constituencies

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,200
absolutely so this is the first time

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,440
i've been involved in a party group two

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,320
and you know i just walked up to people

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,559
at conferences

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,159
yeah yeah i'll help um i don't know how

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,279
i help and they reached out to me and

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,559
said okay

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,399
and i said what you don't want me to

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
write code they said no and i think if

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,640
we give that message to people it's

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,600
not just about writing code and majority

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,799
of projects

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,880
need other help too so

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,240
brody i'd like to turn it over to you

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,159
and i'd like you to talk about your

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,559
experience of how you got involved with

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,839
this group

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,359
yes so i joined working group almost a

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,599
year ago

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,560
and i heard that node.js working groups

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,040
have live

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,000
meetings on youtube so i decided to

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,359
check those

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,399
recordings and i found meetings for

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,690
package maintenance working group

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,919
and after that i subscribed to

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,599
[Music]

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:38,320
working group repo on github

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,440
and from one of uh meeting notes

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:46,000
in that repo i

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:48,960
discovered a pkgs organization with

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,679
tooling repositories so i subscribed to

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,879
several

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,240
repositories there and in a few days

00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,240
i think i got a notification that

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,240
some of support

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
tasks was failing on uh some of node.js

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
versions

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,160
so i decided to check

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,280
those tests and fix it and

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,640
yeah so this is how i got involved

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,880
so everybody can start to contribute

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
just make sure to subscribe to node.js

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
calendar

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
visit our meetings subscribe to

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,280
repositories and

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,640
check notifications regularly

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,720
so thank you rhoda and i'd like to

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,880
reinforce that the most important thing

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,440
is not your ability or the level of your

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,920
contribution it's actually just

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,320
participation

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,760
and i i keep saying this to people uh

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
people i work with people i

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,720
kind of it's actually please participate

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,640
you'll find that you're far more

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,960
valuable than you realize no matter what

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,400
your skill level is

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,920
so i'd like to wrap up today um

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,520
i'd like to thank each one of the

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
panelists

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,720
and if if you're listening to this that

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,800
we will be taking questions

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
what i'd like to say is the number one

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,760
thing with any ecosystem

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,680
for its vibrancy is its community and

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,680
i think whatever your level of

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,760
contribution or skill level is

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,800
actually just that first initial

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,920
participation

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,480
often leads to greater and better things

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,599
and all i can say is there's almost no

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,640
downside to participation i can think of

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,599
all i can say is there is an upside

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,119
we are the largest community i said at

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,240
the beginning we were not

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,800
viewed as serious to begin with but i

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,680
think

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,040
everybody knows we are very serious we

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,920
are very large

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,480
and we are certainly a competitor to

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,119
most

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,440
ways of doing things in what i'd called

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,440
a traditional neoclassical way

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,119
we've provided a different way with a

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,240
very low entry point

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,440
for junior developers with that i'd like

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,040
to thank the panelists

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,440
and wish everyone a great day

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,440
