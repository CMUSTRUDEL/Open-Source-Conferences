1. Introduction (2 mins)
     * Who am I?
     * Setting the expectations
1. Working with Geodataframes (5 mins) 
     * Reading Spatial data as a GeoDataframe
     * The awesomeness of GeoDataframes (An overview of some of the amazing things you can do with a single line of code eg: Spatial joins, Manipulations and transformations)
     * Now that we has established our love for geopandas lets map geodataframes 
1. Let the Mapmaking begin (10 mins)
     * Basic Non-Interactive maps with Geopandas and Matplotlib 
     * Creating basic interactive maps with Folium, Plotly & Kepler (GeoJSONPlots, Clustermaps, Heatmaps, H3gridmaps)
          - Conforming geodataframes to a format accepted by these libraries (usually JSON or a list of lists)
          - Setting the right parameters for different plots 
          - Jazzing up the maps with additional layers, custom styles, tooltips, popups, colors etc 
          - Spatiotemporal Maps with Kepler.gl + Jupyter for handling huge datasets with ease
          - Can we make it any easier ?
     * Why can't making interactive maps be as easy as gdf.folium.plot()? 
1. Enter Geopatra (8 mins)
     * The need for Geopatra (Could it be any Easier and Faster)
     * Wrapping up popular mapmaking libraries for GeoDataframes
     * Create interactive maps with just a single line 
     * Future work and Discussion :)

More Info:

Normally mapping a geodataframe with folium

```
import folium
import geopandas
world = geopandas.read_file(geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))
m = folium.Map(location = [4,10], zoom_start = 3)
folium.GeoJson(world.__geo_interface__).add_to(m)
```

With Geopatra all the parameters you set with folium become optional so you don't have to care about folium

```
import geopatra
m = world.folium.plot()
```
