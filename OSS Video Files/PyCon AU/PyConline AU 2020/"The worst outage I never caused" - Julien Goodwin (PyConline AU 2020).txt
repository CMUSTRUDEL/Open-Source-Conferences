In 2017 I came one keypress from causing Google's main backbone to largely fall off the Internet. This is the story of how we used that incident as a learning opportunity, how a lack of buy-in hindered further improvements, and how an existing toolkit of python libraries allowed testing and validation tools to be quickly built, preventing any chance of a recurrence.

welcome back to the final talk

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,480
on this day on this special day and

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,000
track of devops here at pycon au

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,599
2020 extremely online edition

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,080
thank you for being with us all day

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,359
today it has been a fabulous track

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,119
of amazing talks that has gone

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,960
way better than we ever thought the

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,279
entropy levels have been surprisingly

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
and somewhat disturbingly low

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
so we can only expect that everything

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,439
will explode here at the end

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
of the day and we have an appropriate

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,040
talk for you

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
on that very theme which is the worst

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,200
outage i never caused

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
which is being presented to us by julian

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
goodwin now julian

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
is a senior site reliability engineer at

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
google

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,079
in sydney from 2011 to

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399
2018 he worked on google's production

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,800
networks focused on internet routing and

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,559
interconnection when not at work he does

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,520
things like designing custom embedded

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
linux machines

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,719
and modernizing frequency distribution

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,879
systems he's

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
also the current secretary of linux

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,400
australia which is the parent

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,320
organization for pycon au

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
and they are great supporters of the

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
conference for which we thank them

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,200
a great deal i'm personally really

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
looking forward to this particular talk

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,119
i really want to hear all about when

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
things can go horribly horribly wrong

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,040
hopefully everything will run smoothly

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
for the talk out to the end of the day

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
so please tell us all about your

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,880
experience julian

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,159
thank you so just first up this is

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,720
an incident that happened back in 2017

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
things have changed since uh mostly for

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,799
the better pretty much all for the

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,720
better

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
it's to get you thinking about what

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,680
happens when you have near misses more

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,159
so than the actual incident itself

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
so your cast of characters uh at the

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,240
time i was

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,200
a network sre in sydney uh

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
this was during daylight savings time

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
and

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,439
my counterpart was chris over in

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,880
virginia in the us major thing of note

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,960
we are the people with the deepest

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,800
knowledge or were at the time

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,720
of these systems involved we're not

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,440
we were the experts we also

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
aren't in california and in fact neither

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,239
of our teams are in california

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
networking uh very much at the time

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,160
slightly less so now quite a distributed

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
organization across

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
half a dozen sites in different

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
countries

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,440
and you can see the time zones

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
we both overlapped quite a lot because

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,519
neither of us sleep very much but

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,879
normal workouts do not agree

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,680
so what happened well near miss

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,800
got lucky one monday morning and

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
unusually for me

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
i was in the office at 10 a.m which is

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
stupidly early for me

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
chris sends me a poke going hey it's

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
monday morning your time and

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
still sunday night for me would you mind

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,280
rolling this change we discussed out

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,800
yeah right and just kick off the tool

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,000
and the tooling takes a couple minutes

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
so while it was doing it i i just went

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,599
to go

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,280
verify the change and oh look the

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,400
network's running rev5 we're pushing

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
rev8 let's

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,000
do a diff and

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
diff the files and get a big number of

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,720
changed lines which is

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
strange but one of the other changes

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
might have been significant so

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
let's look at the other changes oh first

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,720
change and it's small

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,879
completely reasonable second change

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
small completion

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,799
and now our change is really big but it

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,799
should be small

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,280
so i look again at what we're changing

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,560
and there's the change we're making but

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,640
in the code review we've discussed uh

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
some aspects of it and gone oh hey

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
there's a magic number that

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
we set on everything but it doesn't do

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,640
anything now so we should get rid of it

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,680
and i'd assume that

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
it was something we'd do later but

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,319
okay it got done it got added to the

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,319
change and committed

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,720
and just being extra paranoid

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
i just check what that magic number is

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
because i i know we discussed it in the

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,280
change but

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,440
we hadn't actually um we actually define

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,759
it as the number not the name so i

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,120
did the check myself and discover that

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,240
oh we we had

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
translated the name incorrectly and

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
actually that's very very important and

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
it would have been very bad

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
if we pushed it so luckily just in

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
another terminal the push tool from

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
earlier is waiting

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
sitting there and ctrl c okay let's do

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,080
that

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,040
roll back the cl so nobody's going to

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,040
accidentally push this

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,639
now what would have happened well

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
basically google would have fallen off

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
the internet

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
there's bits that wouldn't have but

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,120
enough would have broken that for

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,720
practical purposes

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
google fell off the internet as a fair

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
thing to say

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
we also know that there's other networks

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
that use reachability to google as their

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,400
proxy for

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
the internet is working and they would

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,400
have fallen off the internet which is

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,680
a little bit unpleasant and

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,680
as a side effect of the way bgp works uh

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
this isn't inherent but it's combined

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,919
with the design of

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,199
uh that backbone which is a fairly

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,720
standard system

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,400
this would have taken effect for

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,199
everything essentially instantly

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
within two or three seconds we would

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,520
have gone from everything works to

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,000
everything is broken

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,000
which not exactly fun

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,479
okay so how did we get there well a

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
little bit of background for those of

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,800
you that aren't network engineers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
uh you've probably heard of a route on

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,319
the internet which is

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,520
a route is an aggregate of ip addresses

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,400
and you can get them

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,680
ins into the internet's routing system

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
pretty

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
easily in a couple different ways they

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
might be directly advertised by a router

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,400
on a lan if you've got

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,840
a network with 10.000

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
you just have that router go hey i know

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
10-0

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that works you might have a dynamic

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
advertisement say your load balancer

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
your web server pool

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,759
advertise that hi my web server pool is

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
healthy so here is the ip address

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,720
of my pool you can aggregate the above

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,319
when you say have your web server pool

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,759
the load balancer might only advertise

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,039
the one ip address but you need to

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,080
advertise the broader route

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,759
and then there's static routes and you

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
may well have static routes advertised

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,000
for

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
reasons that they just don't have a

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,520
localization

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,680
uh for example we have google public dns

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,080
8.8

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,479
we don't have one place that advertises

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,160
that because it doesn't make sense

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,160
so we define it as a static route and we

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,680
advertise this out of the system and

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
this is roughly what the configuration

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,560
looks like it's junos style config

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,199
and it's a bgp route with a bunch of

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
magic numbers

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,560
and that's not the most

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,560
reviewable thing for humans

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
we we have lots of magic numbers there

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
some of them roughly mean this

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
and where we actually got into trouble

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is you can combine them

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,759
and the way the definitions work in

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,280
uh the routing logic is a little bit

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,280
weird

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,039
you can do matches on multiple as

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
a named entity and in fact that's what

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,879
we had we had the magic behavior match

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,520
as a named entity and

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
unfortunately we had some tooling which

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,000
when you went

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,800
oh tell me what this magic number is it

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
would

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
display that it was magic behavior and

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,039
the ultimate bug in that tool was simply

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,840
that

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,840
the last definition with that number was

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,960
used and that was obviously a silly bag

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
easy to fix

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
and in fact we fixed it in a couple of

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
ways

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,240
but it's sort of irrelevant to the

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,240
actual change

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,960
what we were doing is just breaking up a

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,400
big ipv4 address block into some smaller

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
blocks the sort of thing that

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
as networking people we do all the time

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
we get a block of ip

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,200
a big block of ip addresses we end up

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,479
breaking it down

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
assigning it out to usage

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,839
so chris sends me a cha proposed change

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
to do this

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,880
and we end up discussing it because

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,440
it is just wrote generic things but it

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
it happened to tweak some of the

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
uh experimental parts i'd been working

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
with

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
so this is sort of a thursday morning my

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
time we're going well

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
this part over here we're not

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
advertising that to the world so let's

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,480
just not set those values

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,720
and some discussion goes on and then on

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
saturday morning my time friday night

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,440
chris's time

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
he sends an update going hey we've also

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,720
got this

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,640
extra stuff including do this magic

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
behavior should that go

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
twitch my responses along the lines of

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,279
oh yeah we don't need that it no longer

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
does anything we should just get rid of

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,880
it

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,560
and chris darzen submits the change and

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,160
i didn't look at the change after that

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,760
until monday morning

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,760
so that's sort of how we got there

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:44,240
what what are our root causes

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,640
and well we

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
we had obsolete config we simply

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,640
shouldn't have had a definition

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,320
for magic that hadn't worked for years

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
we'd gotten rid of the policy logic we

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,120
hadn't got rid of the definitions

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,880
uh some systems have the concept of you

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
define your constants like that with a

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
tag saying deprecated or other hints

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
that

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,000
they're obsolete this system did not

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
have that

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,680
we had magic numbers that humans needed

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,959
to deal with there's nothing wrong with

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,800
magic numbers

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,959
but if you're making humans deal with

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
them they really should translate to

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,360
something a human can deal

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,720
with there was no tests we had

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,519
some syntax validation but we didn't

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,279
actually validate the content

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,800
we didn't have simulation we had a

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
simulation framework

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,839
it was a bit too complex and actually

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,480
hooking up

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
uh automation injection into simulation

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,959
of some of these low-level network

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,480
elements

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,839
was not a practical thing um

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
we had related testing

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,720
but in general bgp testing where you've

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,680
got multiple devices

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,680
or virtual devices is not something that

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
i've seen great options for

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,279
uh there's a bunch of them where you've

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
got individual elements

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,640
but not i want these three routers with

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,360
these set of policies hooked together

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
is not a trivial problem it had no clear

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,600
ownership

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
we had half a dozen teams that touched

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
it we had about three that pretty

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,040
regularly touched it

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,079
no team would say they owned it

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,279
and it's more because if they said they

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,680
owned it

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
some people on other teams would object

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,519
except they would refuse to own it

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,279
either

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:38,000
so everyone would change it nobody

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,279
quite did the efforts and maintenance so

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
i did some chris did some but in general

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
maintenance was done minimally this also

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,760
meant that people went to make changes

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
in a minimal possible way for their

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
change as opposed to making

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
the cleanest possible change for the

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
resulting network

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
gives us a bit of a haunted graveyard

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,760
this was

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,360
not great and it meant that nobody

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
understood it and we couldn't get rid of

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
things uh there's

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,279
other aspects that who knows i might

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,600
talk about one day

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:19,279
so okay i let's reset back i i had this

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,079
incident it didn't actually cause an

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,480
incident

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,399
so i mean nobody notices a near-miss

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
maybe i just ignore it and move on with

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
my life it's

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,920
just easier i mean i guess i might have

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,120
to do some work or something

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,959
if that would be noticed

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,279
and well yes i was still twitching three

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,639
days later and i

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,480
i am someone that does large scale

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
incidents this is not the sort of thing

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,519
i do

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,519
and it affected me so

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
i i had to do something i couldn't just

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,279
ignore it

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
now when i was writing this up i

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,680
actually got a question

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
from uh someone that was a colleague at

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,240
the time and is still

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,040
in that networking world asking

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,680
would having had would actually having

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
had the outage be better

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
would we trade a press worthy outage and

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,839
this would have been a major press

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
worthy adage

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
but it might have gotten us the effort

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,040
to fix things

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,480
and in this case it would have been such

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
a major ads that i don't think that's a

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,839
fair

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,200
comparison also at the time there were

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,720
some organizational things and i'm not

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,480
sure we would have gotten engagement

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,399
but that's a consideration i shouldn't

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,279
have had to make

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,120
if you treat your near-misses like a

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,760
real adage

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,000
you get all the benefits of learning

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,120
without the cost of the outage

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
so i did write a postmortem i was still

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,360
twitching

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,199
it it helped me accept

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,519
what we had nearly done what i had

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,040
contributed to

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,079
but it was a near miss i couldn't get

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,279
engagement nobody cared

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,920
now had we had an actual outage i would

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
have

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
had meetings with vps and directors

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,320
having to explain myself

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,320
it wouldn't have been penalized we're

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,440
very good about that

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
but there still would have been a lot of

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
interaction engagement

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,720
without it not so much but it was a good

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
opportunity to document the state of

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
network elements this is something i was

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
big on at the time

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,959
was when we had outages involving these

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,160
haunted graveyard elements

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
it's a wonderful time to explain how

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,320
they work in your postmodernist

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
background section

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,279
and to this day we still have a

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,880
teachable postmortems

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
list that includes a lot of these

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
postmortems i wrote

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
explaining how various elements of the

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,519
network actually work

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,360
because we'd sort of forgotten them

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,880
until they broke and then we got to

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,440
learn how they worked again

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,440
in anger and document

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,639
and okay postmodern that nobody reads

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,639
whatever

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
let's write some tests now this is where

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,160
the python comes in so

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,000
we had parser libraries

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,760
and conveniently i can just

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
hook this file up because it's sitting

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,160
in our source code control system

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,560
and that's got all the hooks for testing

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,480
so i just wrote some tests and passed

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,519
the file

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,320
the file is very cookie cutter in fact

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,079
it explicitly should be cookie cutter

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,360
everything should be standard

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,880
if it's not that's bad

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
so let's just make sure it's exactly

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,000
what we expect

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,759
make sure there's routes of certain type

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,759
if we have zero routes advertised to the

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
internet either someone has

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
re-architected things

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,600
and the test is wrong or

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,639
they're going to break the internet

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
we should have uniqueness uh

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,600
indeed we discovered bugs with this we

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
discovered we'd have the same route to

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,560
find twice in the file

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,519
it didn't matter but it still meant that

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,079
the humans would be confused

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
we set those magic numbers only the ones

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,959
we expect

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,440
uh some topological rfc 1918

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,120
once you start writing tests and get the

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
key ones in

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
for a lot of this sort of config

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
elements you can think of some ideas

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,600
that you should test

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,320
and they're quite easy and

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,160
it turns out every time i've done this

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,320
we've found latent errors

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,160
usually trivial sometimes they matter

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
and we've always had at least one

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,360
incident prevented

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
pretty quickly at the very least we've

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
saved someone

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,480
uh making a change going to canary that

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,720
change and discovering it doesn't work

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
that alone has almost always paid for

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
those tests

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,480
very quickly

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,319
now a couple months later

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,439
this this should not have been needed

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,160
this second part because

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,760
we we had this broader config generation

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,679
system that

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,520
uh was at the time an upcoming thing it

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,959
was still used for some stuff

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,959
but we

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,880
we hadn't rolled it out for everything

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
and this was a bit of conflict we hadn't

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559
and at the time of the incident it was

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,160
oh yeah within about six months we'll

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,200
get to this

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,919
uh incident was in april in november

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,919
when the u.s is off on thanksgiving

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,600
things are a little bit quiet

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
and they hadn't started work on this

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,799
generator so

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,720
instead of writing it in their complex

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,600
system i just wrote a simple one in

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
python

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,480
taking uh text protocol buffer this is

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,320
google we love our protocol buffers

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,720
and generate the config file as output

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,919
and then a simple test that just says

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
generated output

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,160
is identical to the file

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,880
which very easy way to make this sort of

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,919
manual generator that's an interim thing

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
work and be reliable and trustable and

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,280
you can see that

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,799
saying as15169 external in text is a lot

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
more readable and trustable

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,600
than magic numbers saying this route is

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,360
global is a lot more trustable than

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,760
27 localized locations

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,960
oh wait it should actually be 30 we

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,480
added some and forgot to edit them

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,840
and this was something i knocked out in

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
two days

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,360
massively improving the state of players

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,240
result

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,559
and it is eventually get being replaced

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,840
but it's certainly paid for itself

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,240
simply because

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,320
every change review is so much easier

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
and of course the better your libraries

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,760
and tooling

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
the better a toolkit you've got to make

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
simple

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,280
more simple tools for yourself the

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,559
easier these are to write

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,080
the better your system gets

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,880
and of course shared libraries you can

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,840
introspect and understand them

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,840
that's actually where this stops so

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,600
this is a story of an

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,240
incident that never happened there's not

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,080
the big

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,919
oh look at the media when we screwed

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,679
everything up

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,480
it's a story of a learning opportunity

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,760
we weren't able to fully use

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,200
because we seemed to only we were

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,600
learning from incidents when we had

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,320
incidents we were much worse learning

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,080
from them when they weren't incidents

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,679
and you get a wonderful opportunity with

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,600
a near-miss

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,240
when you write a post-mortem think about

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,000
your incident without the where we got

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
lucky

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,039
had i not checked that diff had i just

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,240
hit push we would have had an adage

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,080
had i not looked

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,080
triple checked uh the actual definition

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,880
file would have had an adage

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,880
but you can

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,200
you can learn you can fix things and

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,320
that's that's what i want to

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,440
want to share hopefully without needing

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,080
to break everything

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
thank you very much

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,320
that was fantastic um and

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,760
very close to my heart this is this is

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,720
something that i have personally lived

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,559
through so this is

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,080
this is very very close to me and i i

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,360
love this talk um

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,440
a couple of questions um i i have one in

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,360
fact that i would like to ask

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,320
which is around that that you chose to

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,480
do this

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,159
that it was something that you you said

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,640
look we had a near miss things weren't

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,640
actually on fire it didn't burn down

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,679
um i've been in that sort of situation

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
before

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,880
does it does that require just a kind of

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,240
internal cultural

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,400
discipline to to do that post-mortem

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,520
even though you didn't have this massive

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,600
press release inducing event

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,559
or is there a way that you think that

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
you can encourage organizations

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,440
because people don't really like to talk

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
about their failure and that's one of

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,520
the reasons that we actually

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,840
ran this track there's an element of

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,080
autonomy so

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
uh the history of that part of google

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,280
networking would be a whole explanation

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,720
as to why

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,400
but the operations part of networking

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
didn't have a huge amount of autonomy

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
for

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,440
and gained it very slowly over time

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
this was towards the end of that where

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
the operations group really was quite

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
autonomous

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
and the nature of the work i did in that

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
group

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,080
was itself enormous anomalously

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,400
autonomous

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
for that group i found these haunted

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,640
graveyards i fixed them i

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,159
learned them so this was on brand for me

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,159
but this was still the first post modern

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,880
i wrote from first person

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
for an incident i managed i'd worked on

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
a lot of

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,720
major incidents but they'd never been

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,080
incidents that i had

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,080
caused or triggered

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,640
and i guess that was part of the

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,840
different feeling from it

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
but you

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,960
it's helpful to see that people don't

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,120
get punished there have been outages

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
i have seen at google caused by someone

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
doing something silly

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
they shouldn't have done either because

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,919
they didn't know not to do it or

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,840
for whatever reason that is completely

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,240
justifiable and

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,600
having seen that those people we

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,679
celebrate them

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
for the learning opportunity meant i

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
wasn't worried about getting fired even

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,200
if i had caused the adage

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
i was i'm more disappointed that we

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,240
failed the learning opportunity

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,240
than missed nowadays

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,679
and that's something that we were trying

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
to encourage with talks with this track

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,640
is that

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
encouraging people to feel safe to share

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,159
the failure so that we can learn from it

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
that it could become that

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
that learning experience um so this is a

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,880
great example of

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,720
of one of those so thank you for that uh

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
another question we have uh from the

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,799
chat is that did you eventually get

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,039
engagement on the value of the work

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,400
that you've done as a result of the near

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
miss if not from your management

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
structure but from your peers

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
uh i did get some i mean as i say it was

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,799
sort of on brand so this was

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,919
the stuff i was always doing i'd had

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,039
similar where

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
the simplifications unblocked things we

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
were doing

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,799
these sort of conflict generation

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,200
systems

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
simply looking at the proposals for

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
these conflict generation

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,200
systems going there's a whole heap of

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,360
complexity for

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,360
three peering connections out of 30 000.

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,559
do those three matter how about we

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
delete them and then we don't need to do

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,520
all this extra work

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,880
and there were many of those i

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
i mean for the networking people at

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,919
google not that there's anyone here

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,360
there's a whole list of them

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,159
but you event you become able to look

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,679
back at

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,480
work over the over a couple of years and

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,159
go here are things i enabled

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,760
it wasn't visible they were blocking at

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
the time but

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
we have made things easier we have made

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,039
our systems easier

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,840
uh when we shut down networking in

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,200
sydney i was able to finish off a couple

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,520
of projects and that meant

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,360
i didn't have to teach the incoming team

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,640
about a bunch of things because

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,840
they were gone so that made

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
everyone's life easier

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,679
yeah i think that's something that we

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,520
miss a little bit with these

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,520
these ideas of like we're avoiding a

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
failure mode and that that's the only

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,480
reason that we would do this is that

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
there's actually all of these other

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,720
benefits

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,279
that are worth it like well well worth

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
it

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
even if we if it didn't actually avoid

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,799
any failures at all it just has so many

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,440
of these other really good things to it

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,400
um we've got another another couple of

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,799
questions they're kind of

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,760
too too past the same thing as around

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,919
getting this

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,039
getting engagement from other people

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,039
essentially it sounds like getting

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,360
buy-in i think is what's meant here

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,320
um without too much of your own personal

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
investment

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,039
and then balancing how much of your own

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,679
personal investment you put in is it

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,159
kind of a picky battles question it

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,279
really

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,080
is i as i say i was a slightly odd

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:24,720
organizational position where

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,440
this was in my area to touch and

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,840
uh when we had situations where someone

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,960
else caused an outage

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,279
somewhat similar again but this was

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,960
config i owned i would end up taking it

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,320
on and working for them and that

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,600
that was a lot easier for me to stomach

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,919
because it's their mess up that

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,279
had i had an infinite time i would have

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
restructured things so it wouldn't have

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,320
happened

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,799
but often it wasn't something i'd

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,799
thought of

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:58,320
but getting getting help

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,000
to where you need hey devs can you add

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
this feature to make

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,360
make the system a little bit safer it's

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
it's beyond my skill abilities or

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,520
complexity or

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,360
touches too deep whatever

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,640
some organizations have really great

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,720
behaviors and that works wonderfully

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,320
some organizations do not

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,520
in uh in my time in google networking

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,720
quite often popping over to the see the

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,600
people in person was really valuable

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,960
a lot of the more networking-y people

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,080
were

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,360
used to randomly chat email

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,919
contact and consider things

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,880
but more the development people it was

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,919
we worked a lot better in person

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,080
and i i have had cases where

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,840
uh four months of arguing is solved in

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,200
five minutes by flying halfway around

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,320
the world

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,159
and it's silly but four months of our

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,000
time is so much more expensive than

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
flying me halfway across the planet

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
that i always feel silly at the end of

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,960
it and go why didn't we do that

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:07,520
um it's it's funny how often

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
we're so deeply embedded in all these

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,960
computer systems that i'm

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,799
i'm getting old now so i'm learning

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,320
things from a different perspective

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,120
uh the humans are the important part of

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,480
of everything so so often so very very

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,880
often and i think as a

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,880
as a field we are getting a lot better

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
at understanding the human

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,600
side of all of these systems we build

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,080
and and how important the human bits

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,440
are in in making everything else work it

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,200
turns out the computer parts are

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
actually kind of easy

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,720
relatively speaking yeah as fun and

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,880
simple as the machines are

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
it's talking to humans convincing the

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,360
humans it's

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,840
something you see as a junior engineer

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,799
as i want to do this to play with the

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,720
computers

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,480
yes but being a senior engineer means

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
i'm actually programming the humans with

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,520
documents

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,760
so much i love that phrase i'm totally

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,320
stealing that that's great

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,919
um i think we're running up when

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
actually a little bit over time so i'm

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,000
gonna have to wrap it there for

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,520
questions uh

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
now julian i think you are gonna hang

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
around for a little bit and be available

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,120
in the chat

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,960
for questions is that right i will be in

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,240
the hallway chat or the

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,880
uh social vc very cool

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,159
uh so do stick around that's our last

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
talk for the day so um

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,520
do do come and have a chat with with

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,080
julian in the hallway

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,720
chat or in the community bc uh that is

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,880
around there

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
for the end of the day uh thank you

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,840
talk and a fabulous way to end the

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:42,720
devops track here today

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:42,720
