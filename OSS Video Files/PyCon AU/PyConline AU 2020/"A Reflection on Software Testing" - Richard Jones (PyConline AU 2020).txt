This is an opinionated talk about issues I have observed during my career around software testing, including our conversations about it, but also the many materials produced describing how it should be done. One of my inspirations for this talk is the realisation that in some ways we have lost our way with testing, losing sight of some of the very early wisdom.

I will talk about some of those conversations we have, the language we use, but I will also present some advice, with concrete examples, of how we all might improve how we approach and implement testing.
