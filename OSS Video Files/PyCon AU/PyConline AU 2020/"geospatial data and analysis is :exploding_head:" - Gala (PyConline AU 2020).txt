hi everyone and welcome back to the

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,400
science data and analytics track

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,599
next up we've got gala talking about

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
geospatial data

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,480
analysis is exploding head gala is the

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,080
head of analytics at neighborlytics a

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
startup in the urban tech space trying

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
to help those in the city making space

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,600
to deliver better economic and social

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,840
values in community

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,359
communities she is passionate about

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,720
elevating the voice of those who are

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,359
marginalized and spend some

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,039
free time reading and ranting about

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,040
intersectional feminists questioning and

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
planting seeds of thought into those

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,640
helping maintain the status quo and

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
trying to be an overall more empathetic

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
and better human

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,960
take it away gala thank you

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,480
um so

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,399
hi my name is scala um and i am the head

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
of analytics at neighborlytics and

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
today i'm basically going to be talking

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,320
about geospatial data

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,079
um so yeah

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
so how this talk is gonna happen i

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,479
basically have what i call

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,879
snacks which are just kind of thoughts

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,119
and

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280
comments on things that are good to know

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,799
and kind of go back to sometimes

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
then i'm gonna have a little pantry

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,960
slide a couple of slides about

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
stuff to use for like within python and

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
then i'm gonna talk about

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
for dinner what things i'm excited about

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
and i

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,920
i just i guess i mostly want to say that

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,920
this talk is inspired

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
as a way to kind of brain dump things

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,040
that i have learned while working in the

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
space but not necessarily as a way to

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
tell you what to do

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,479
um yeah so it's mostly snacks and then a

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,280
little bit of pantry and dinner

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,119
so i'll start this um this talk by

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
stating that working with geospatial

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
data is really hard

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and that doesn't mean you shouldn't do

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
it but it means you should have empathy

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
with yourself when you're attempting all

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
of these problems

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
i have found it particularly hard to get

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,680
into geospatial data

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
and some of the reasons around that is

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
that it's really hard to get started

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
because there's

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
unlike kind of when you start with

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,880
python um

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,560
with geospatial data it's kind of

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
there's a lot you need to learn in order

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,200
to get started

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,720
um it's also a really messy setup and it

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
tends to be os dependent

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
and when you actually when you use

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,760
software the software is really big and

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
clunky

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,599
um and so it can really slow down your

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
computer and so obviously that makes it

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,800
hard to

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,480
just play around and sometimes there's a

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,720
lot of computation that

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
seems like it should be simple and then

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
all of a sudden it becomes really hard

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,400
and so as i go through this talk the

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,040
main point of this is like here's all

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,200
these things that i have heard about

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
and maybe learned a little bit about

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
that is good for you to kind of have

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,959
there

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,640
as as something to go back to um

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
yeah and the aim is to share the slides

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
afterwards which have a lot of links and

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,480
stuff

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,120
so let's start with some snacks

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,040
okay so i'm mostly going to be focusing

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,120
on vector data there's another type of

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
data in geospatial called raster data

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
which tends to

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
be about images and stuff like that but

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
i mostly play in the vector data space

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
and

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
um the way we want to the way i think

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
about vector data is we have these

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
points

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
we have these lines or i have these

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,319
polygons so in

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
real life it's like where i am a path

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
that i'm walking

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
or maybe an area that i'm interested in

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
or occupying

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,360
and when i talk about these the ways

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
that i want to have like a mental model

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
about it is with a point i like to think

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
about it

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
as a tuple or a list of size two or

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
three so

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
um you can have x y and z you can have a

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
high dimension like for example if

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,959
you're standing at the top of a building

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,640
and one of the things that's interesting

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,319
about points that's good to think about

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,319
is the fact that mostly

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
in geospatial you'll get latitude and

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
longitude but if you come from a math

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,840
background you're used to x comma y

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
and this is opposite so that's something

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
to think about

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
um yeah a line string one of the things

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
that's

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
interesting about the line string is

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
that the order matters and so you

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
basically want to think about it as

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,799
google maps direction so here's a

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
stopping point then you walk in this

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
direction for this long

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
and then another stopping point and so

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,080
the order matters in the line

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,239
and in the polygon you want to think

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,040
about it as a closed loop and

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
and it kind of includes all of the area

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
inside of that

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,040
and it can be a donut but yeah

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
you know it's it's good to think about

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
it as a big closed

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,919
loop with everything inside included and

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
i just want to say all of these things

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,960
depend on what file system you're

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
working on and so they're not always

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,600
true

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,919
um within this

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
like stuff that we have points lines and

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
polygons

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
in geospatial we also encounter things

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
like multi-line

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
and multi-polygon and why this is really

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,919
messed up

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
is because you can have a set of

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
polygons

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
kind of if you think about it as a csv

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
you can have different rows where each

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,759
row is a polygon

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
but a multi-polygon would actually

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
define lots of polygons within the same

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
row

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
and a good example of this is for

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,919
example tasmania

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
if i look at the polygon that is

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,919
tasmania it's actually

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
separated polygons but it's all of it is

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
tasmanian

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
so if i was for example to get a file

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
that had

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
data of australia tasmania might all

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,039
appear all in one row and

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
that can be that can create lots of

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,680
problems when you're working with

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,680
geospatial data so it's something to

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
think about

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
there's also this thing called complex

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
geometries and if you look at this um

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,120
center polygon here one of the things

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
you see there's like a bit of a shaded

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
gray line and so

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
if you think about what we talked about

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,360
in the line as order

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,280
you can start thinking you can start

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,400
kind of thinking about the fact that

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,520
if i follow these points in a weird

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
order i can actually

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,560
cross my polygon and then cross it back

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,160
and

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
that can actually create lots and lots

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,120
of problems and so um

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,199
a good thing to think about and note is

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
this concept of complex geometries which

00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
means

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
basically it's not a simple geometry and

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
a simple geometry is one that

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,639
is you know doesn't have any of these

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
quirks to it

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
um that's something i didn't learn about

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
until like quite far into being in

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,479
geospatial data and it's a really

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,680
um it's it's a cause of a lot of pain

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,600
um yeah so one of the biggest issues

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
with geospatial data is that the earth

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
is not flat

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
and so when you have some geospatial

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
data

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
it comes with what we call a spatial

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
reference system which is the same thing

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,360
as a coordinate reference system

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
and i guess the way i think about this

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
is is like my data

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,039
has some value so i can see some numbers

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,880
um

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
and then i need to know how to interpret

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,039
those values when i look at them in the

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,800
context of the earth

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,680
so these these kind of spatial reference

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
systems or coordinate reference systems

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
you kind of want to think about they

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,759
have two parts they have a coordinate

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
system

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
which tells you how a particular uh

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
coordinate is defined so

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
think x and y or lat long or maybe it's

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,400
an angle and a radius

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and then you have a datum and the datum

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
specifies where the center of this

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
coordinate system is

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,800
and the scale and also the orientation

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
um and there's lots of datums out there

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
just like there's lots of

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
coordinate reference systems out there

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,440
and in particular in the industry we

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,880
like to use these

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,319
epsg codes to kind of grab predefined

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,319
ones

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,479
and these are also sometimes referred to

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
as srids and

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,240
i wouldn't even know the technical

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
difference between these

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
i believe the sr ids there's more of

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
them than the eps g codes but

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,440
the main point is like these are words

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
you want to look up when you're thinking

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
about your chord and

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,000
reference system and this picture that

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
you see here on the right

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
is actually um one that i find really

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
interesting because

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
so in australia as you can see in this

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
picture

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
is that because due to plate tectonic

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
motion australia has actually

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
shifted and so before we used to use

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,400
this um

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,919
datum called gda94 but now we're going

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,400
into gda 2020

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,440
and in particular um this new datum

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,720
will have like a lot of places will be

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,919
1.8 meters

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,160
to the northeast of the gta 94 and

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,479
like this is nuts right we never think

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
about how these things are changing kind

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,720
of

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,720
right underneath us um and so and so

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
it shows you just how important it is

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,519
that you

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,919
know very clearly what your coordinate

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,080
reference system is

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,919
okay so these eps g codes um maybe

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
something that i learned really late

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,279
and that i would like for you to know if

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
you haven't done this stuff before is

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,320
if you're given a file and has latitudes

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,160
and longitudes and

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,920
you're like what's the c you know what's

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,320
the uh crs what do i do

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,600
it's like a good one to start with is

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,160
this one we call

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,000
epsg-4326 now the coordinate system here

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,200
is is latitudes and longitudes and it's

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720
in degrees

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,399
so when you move you're actually in

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
degrees and the datum is what we call

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,080
wgs84

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,080
and this is this is basically like

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,640
telling telling you that you're going to

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,360
be using these latitudes and longitudes

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,760
um and it kind of defines as you move

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
and

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
one of the things that's interesting

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
about this is that because this

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
coordinate

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
reference system is in degrees when you

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,440
want to measure something

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
the measurements will come back to you

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
in degrees

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,680
which is a really messed up thing to

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,360
think about because well at least when i

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,720
started geospatial data

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
all i want to think about is how far

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
things are in meters and i didn't even

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,440
realize that there was kind of a way

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
to think about how far things are for me

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,760
in

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
you know in the kind of degree space i

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
kind of that was something that really

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,240
tripped me up

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
so most kind of proper geospatial files

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
will come with one

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
um so for example in shapefile which is

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
something that comes from esri

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,959
there'll be actually lots of kind of

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
files there's a bit of a package of

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,720
files and one of them contains this

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,720
information um but some of them

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
simply just have it defined somewhere in

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,760
text for example

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,079
um which yeah so

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
okay so the earth is round we need to

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,480
flatten it

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
because we want to start measuring

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,839
things in meters and so

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
that brings us to projections which oh

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,040
no the

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
video's not playing uh it's coming it's

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,120
coming

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,120
yes okay so projections is basically how

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,839
we try and make something round

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,880
flat and i say round but really the

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
earth is not even

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
exactly around so that's how complicated

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,160
this stuff can get

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,920
and so when we make these things flat

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
we have to optimize for a particular

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,839
thing so we might want to

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,720
and and that depends what you're

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,720
interested in

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,839
and so if i'm measuring distance i want

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,959
to optimize

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,360
uh for things that are gonna kind of be

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
accurate in the distance perspective

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,600
and what's interesting about this is we

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,760
actually call that a transformation

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
and this is good to know because when

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,600
you're kind of googling

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
the word to look for is how to do a

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,440
transformation and basically what you're

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
doing is you're going from one crs that

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
is not flat to one crs that is flat or

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,000
projected

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
um a good way to kind of know what space

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
you're playing in is to look at the

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
units of your crs

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
um if it's in meters you're probably in

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
a good spot

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
if it's in things like degrees probably

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,320
in a bad spot

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
um and there's local ones so as i

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,959
mentioned earlier

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,720
um in australia we like to use this

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,959
um gda 2020 nowadays and so

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
that's gonna let you be very precise

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
within kind of the australian area and

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,040
there's actually some defined

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
down to like victoria and down to new

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,600
south wales because

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,959
clearly australia is really large um

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
yeah so i find projections to be the

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,120
coolest but they're also the

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,160
the biggest source of of pain whenever

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,000
things aren't working for me

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,720
all right so well-known text um

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
someone decided to do this text markup

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,079
language which was great because

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
now it's like this is how we define

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,000
geometries

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
in pure text and this is really nice

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
because

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,680
in particular lots of different

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,120
libraries and lots of different places

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
will accept well-known text and then

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
turn it into their own thing that they

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
define

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,120
and and stuff so

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399
well-known text is like total lifesaver

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,399
i really recommend

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
you kind of keep it in your back pocket

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
little chocolate snack

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,800
um cool so

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,360
a pantry let's get into some of the um

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
more kind of heavy python stuff and i

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
say heavy but there's really not that

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
much

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
so i guess i just kind of want to take a

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
little bit of time to talk about

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,600
all the different libraries that i use

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,680
in it every day

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
it doesn't mean that these are the only

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,079
ones there's so many out there

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,760
but these ones are are quite generally

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,680
used and so

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,360
shapely is a library that lets you kind

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,959
of quite easily

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
particularly with the well-known text

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
thing just define

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
and draw geometries quite easily

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
particularly if you're in a jupiter

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
notebook

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,399
if for example one of the coolest things

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,240
is you can make a geometry and you can

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
just print it

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
and it actually shows you the shape so

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,720
if you make a little polygon you can

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
actually see its shape

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
um so it's a it's a really nice place to

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
start shapely

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
um but it's a bit sometimes it can be a

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
bit just kind of

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
at least for me i use it quite

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,800
elementarily like to define a point or

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
to define a line

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
now geopi i like um geopi

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,160
lets you do simple calculations like

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,839
distance and it lets you unders for

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,440
example you can calculate distances

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,760
understanding the world

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,480
as perfectly around or understanding the

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,720
world as

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
an ellipsoid and so it really lets you

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,639
play around with well what happens when

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
i

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
don't think of the earth as exactly

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,279
spherical or whatever

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,959
um geopandas is a mess as its name

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,639
suggests it's just like pandas but it

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,399
has this geocomponent and so it can

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,680
understand each row

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,440
as a geometry and you can also give it

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,000
your crs and so

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,519
it can understand that you know things

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
that you're playing around in but it can

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,160
also do

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,920
stuff like find me the distance to all

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,440
of these places or find me all of the

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,519
all of my rows that are within this

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,279
polygon and so it can be quite

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,600
um useful to do like actually quite a

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,240
bit of stuff um i really like the the

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,560
geojson package so geojson is

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
a kind of it's a json defined but it has

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
geometries

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,560
and so it's um it's actually a really

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
nice way to pass data around without it

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,519
ever getting corrupted and to

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,199
kind of not be specific about a

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,399
particular um

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,880
software and um

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
i like it because when you read or write

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,199
with this

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
library called geojson it will check

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,199
whether it's valid geojson

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,120
um because you will be shocked to know

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,720
that lots of libraries can write

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,920
geojson like text but then it's not

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,519
valid geojson and that is part of the

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
problem in the industry

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
um geo alchemy is something that i use

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,079
with sql alchemy which is an orm and i

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
use this particularly when interacting

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,440
with

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,240
postgres database that has this postgis

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,079
add-on

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,399
which let's it's basically a postgres

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,279
database that lets you have geometries

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
um h3 is this picture that you see here

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,600
on the ride

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,959
oh sorry oh where did i go

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
ah um and it's it's actually posted by

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,759
uber

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,839
but it it it kind of has gritted the

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,040
entire world into these little hexagons

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,040
and their tilings

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
which means there's no space in between

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
in between them so it's a really nice

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
way to understand

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
areas and then for plotting i usually

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
use

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,959
plot layer discardings but i really want

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,839
to say that pg admin for example

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,720
lets you when you're using postgres it

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,560
will let you

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
it will actually plug things for you so

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,279
it's a really useful

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,279
tool that i learned recently

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,560
all right so for analysis and algorithms

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,519
the kind of newest ones are pysol and

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,959
moonpie

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,360
i actually haven't played much with

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,680
these but i mean i was

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,279
literally looking at their websites

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
yesterday and thinking

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
how many days i need to take off work so

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,440
i can start playing with these

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,199
um and they're actually quite um new and

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
advanced and they kind of propose a lot

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,440
of new algorithms that

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,600
before have been a bit kind of not very

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,759
easily to get to from the geospatial

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,120
side

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,639
all right so the community um

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,079
on the right here i put some slack

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,199
channels that i usually i'm playing

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,320
around in and some

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,920
um twitter stuff that i follow but

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
i guess from the community i want to say

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,279
is like it's very dude

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
and white heavy and that can make it

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,199
really hard to

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,959
interact in and um i guess the

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,639
the one main comment i want to make is

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,480
that the geospatial community

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
a lot of the people come from other

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,280
fields and so

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,959
they all have very kind of impressive

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,000
knowledge in one particular area but

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,760
then they'll have like

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
no knowledge on this other area and so

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
one of the things that you get in the

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,679
forums is like

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
you just want to ask a really simple

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
question and the next thing you know you

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,120
have these like

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,760
massive amount of text coming back at

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,640
you with

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,160
so much jargon and so much information

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,160
that it can almost feel like

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,240
it's not it's not accessible um

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
and so that's something to be very

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
conscious about that it's not you

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
you're coming into this community of

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
people who are kind of really deep into

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,039
some particular knowledge

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,120
and um and yeah like i have i have found

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,559
it to be really hard but the more i kind

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
of stay in the same communities the more

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,520
you realize that this

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,039
entire lump of text is what everybody

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,320
gets because this is a problem that

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,600
everybody has

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,280
um even from like installing geospatial

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,200
stuff on your computer

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,120
so so i i guess what i'm saying is

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,600
is take it slowly and and kind of

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,559
don't be don't shy away too fast um from

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,919
the community

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
and it is changing the women in

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,720
geospatial has made a big noise

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
um to kind of bring more women or at

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,919
least highlight the women that

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,400
are in um in geospatial

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,400
all right so my one of my main slides is

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
around debugging so here's some thoughts

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,760
which is basically like

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,360
things are going wrong good things to do

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,039
check your crs

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,320
are you in the right crs and the one you

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,960
want to be do you even understand it

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,559
check your geometries there's this thing

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,400
you can do which is called simplifying

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,080
your geometries it basically means do

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
you really need all these vertices could

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,320
you make it a bit

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,600
simpler and have the exact same shape um

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
if you're having lots of issues

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,640
sometimes your geometry being a multi

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,520
geometry can

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
make problems check that the lat long is

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
actually

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,320
what i guess the right way around

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,160
because lots of places want to define it

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,360
as x comma y and that's fine but you

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
just need to make sure that you have

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
kind of

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,640
that knowledge when you start trying to

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
compute things

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,799
plot something always put a map behind

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
it don't just look at its shape

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,160
make sure it's not in the middle of the

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,280
ocean um

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,640
when you plot it against the map um

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,480
be careful with hidden stuff that's

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,440
overlapping sometimes when you do plot

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,039
it you'll see

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
one point right on top of the other and

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,039
so you'll actually think it's just one

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,919
point why am i seeing five in my data

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,039
um and so one of the tools people use

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,039
for this is to try

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,760
and do jittering so that you can

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,520
actually see all the things there

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,600
a lot of times you go and plot stuff and

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
you get absolutely nothing

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
i think this has this has to do with

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,799
like error checking like

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,720
people giving good error messages in the

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,679
libraries but nothing usually means

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,799
there's an error

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,200
not that you have nothing um i really

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
like

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,760
opening the file in some sort of

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
software so i tend to use qgis

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
blast i mentioned before pg admin shows

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
you geometry so it's actually a really

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,559
nice place to go look

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,240
make sure you read the docs just

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,159
literally a week ago i was like

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
i had this frantic moment thinking about

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,400
geometry versus

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,120
a geography so make sure you understand

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
what the different

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,520
things mean um by the way a geography

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,200
means you're kind of

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
in the lot long space and um a geometry

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
can mean anything

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
including something that is flat um and

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,240
invest in learning how to use the

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
library lots of the libraries have some

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,360
sandboxes and stuff so

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,919
make sure you take some time to kind of

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,240
look in there

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
all right so some things i'm excited

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
about and i kind of skip through these

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
a little bit fast and make sure there's

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,080
room for questions but

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,159
i'm in the urban planning space so this

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,919
city to city translating

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
um is actually really cool which it

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,320
basically says it kind of tries to

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
take from natural language processing

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,480
and say if i give this data

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
and i um put it in in a common vector

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,720
space then can i find

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,559
um two things that are similar via um

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
their vector space representation so

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,400
that's a really

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
out there and cool idea because it means

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,000
we could find

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,559
similar neighborhoods or similar um

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,320
cities across the world

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,919
another thing that i really liked was

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
this um person who

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,200
kind of took all the open street map

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
data and and started

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,480
kind of plotting it in in ways that were

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,880
kind of

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,840
talking about its form from the urban

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
side and

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,200
in particular it shows here they

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,679
analyzed basically our streets pointing

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
north um east south or west and how many

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,799
of them and so the ones that look

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,080
exactly like crosses tend to be really

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
gridded cities or

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,159
they actually are really great cities

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,840
and then um you can see other ones

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,280
um like on the top right corner where

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,720
it's like it just looks like a filled up

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,679
circle which means streets are

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
nuts they're going all over the place

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,240
cool and

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
the last thing i want to say i mentioned

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,000
this before but this montpai

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,679
is um it's a library for quantitative

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,760
analysis of urban form and

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,520
what it's doing is it's kind of it has

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,039
all of these really cool algorithms to

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,320
try and understand

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,679
um space and kind of places around them

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,120
and and

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,799
um and yeah it takes it's kind of

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
pre-coded a bunch of the algorithms that

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,760
are used in the industry so

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,120
i'm really excited about them so

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,120
that's it for me um i

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,000
just want to say that we are hiring so

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,280
please find me somewhere in the chat

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
to talk to me about that and yeah

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,960
thanks for listening sorry that was a

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,360
bit of a ramble but had a lot to share

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,880
thanks carl that was a really great talk

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
um quite a few things that i wish

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,960
actually knew

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,919
two or three weeks ago now

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,159
we have a few questions in the chat um

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
okay

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,280
um one from jeff why work with a

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
projection why not just try and answer

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,159
your questions

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,919
like how far between a and b without a

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,280
projection and only use a projection

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
when you want to visualize things for

00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
users

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
uh yeah i mean why not when you're

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,640
playing in the

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,080
kind of i'm in round space like um when

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,400
you're on the sphere

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
sometimes a lot of this computation

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,760
becomes math heavy right

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,520
and so um when you kind of go to do

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
things flat you can then do lots of them

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
really fast

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,000
um so i mean like as i said i'm not

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,919
telling you what to do in this talk i

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,559
think part of it is mostly like

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
know about projections i find it really

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,400
hard to think about

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,440
um maybe i'm just a local thinker and so

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
when i think about

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
standing on the beach i kind of think

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
about how flat everything looks around

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
me but clearly i have an understanding

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,039
that if i go far enough

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
it's round and i have to start

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,000
considering the roundness

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,200
um so i like playing in a space where i

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,240
can check things

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,760
and so flatness lets you do that um i

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
mean obviously roundless lets you do

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,159
that but

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,919
in flatness there's a little bit more of

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
intuition i can grab from previous

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
experience whereas in brownness that all

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
becomes a bit harder

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
so maybe as a way to start it's nice to

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,960
be flat but yeah i mean

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,360
there's lots of stuff to be said around

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,559
staying in the kind of spherical

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,120
space thanks scala and just one more

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,240
quick question before we run out of time

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,640
um any tool recommendation full

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,559
from sorry about my pronunciation

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
any tool recommendations for looking at

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
raw data straight out of csvs before we

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,360
start working with it

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,400
you know what i mean i really like qgis

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,159
because you can just kind of

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,520
drop it tell it where's the lot where's

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,480
the lawn and then

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
it just plots it um so i guess in that

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,760
sense

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,000
i am a sucker for like if you just want

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,640
to get something faster just look at it

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,159
uh doing that like with python it does

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
kind of take some knowledge and a little

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
bit

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,039
of setting up now with that said as you

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
work with this data

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,320
for a while you kind of start developing

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
all kinds of kind of

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,919
functions that you build up that you're

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
like this lets me plot something fast

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,880
but

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,159
i i i like starting with qgis because

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
you literally can just

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,320
drag a file in and then you can see it

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,120
and you can just put a map behind it

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,320
really easily

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,080
so um i know that doesn't sound so

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,760
coder obsessed but it's true like i

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,279
really like using the software cool

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,440
well thanks for that excellent

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,360
introduction gala um

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,120
we have a we're at time now so we're

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,919
going to have a 10 minute break

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,720
and then we're going to come back for um

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,799
to hear about

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,760
the software engineering part of data

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,600
science um

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,279
everyone else applause and

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,840
i'm sure god will be around for the rest

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,400
of pycon so try and find her in venulis

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,480
and

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
ask some more questions if you have any

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:53,679
well see everyone in 10 minutes

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,679
