Attendees will learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks and other Python tools to engage the public to create meaningful outcomes and positive social change. The Notebooks weâ€™ve created serve to empower interested members of the public in participatory learning about industry-related pollution that is meaningful to them and their networks, as well as creating strategic, compelling, and informative reports of environmental injustices to inform community action. Our goal is to create a future in which justice and equity are at the center of environmental, climate, and data governance. 
No environmental justice knowledge required to attend.

hey everyone it is our final talk of the

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,680
afternoon here in the flip-flop operator

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,879
auditorium and i'm getting better at

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,240
saying that i think

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,960
but it's taken some work um

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,519
our final talk is a pre-recorded talk by

gonna be talking to us about jupiter

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,039
notebooks

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,120
uh so she will be in the chat uh

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,200

hello everyone my name is malvika bott

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
and today i am here on behalf of the

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
environmental data

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
and governance initiative or edgy for

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
short

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,640
today i will be speaking about using

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,280
jupiter notebooks to empower the public

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,280
with environmental data

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
i hope to give you some insight into our

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
project's goals

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,119
and our approach to data processing then

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
give you a demo on one of our jupiter

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
notebooks

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,400
talk about our use of notebooks at

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,200
public events other uses for our work

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,280
and our next steps but first a little

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
introduction to edgy

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,159
we are a network of over 175 members

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
from more than 80 different academic

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,040
institutions and non-profits

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
across north america composed foremost

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
by grassroots volunteer efforts

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,600
we are an international organization the

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
most of our membership is based in the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
united states

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
edgy through an effort to protect

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
environmental data in the wake of

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
president trump's

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
election in 2016 has served as a

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
watchdog group

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720
as he created an unprecedented project

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,600
to duplicate and monitor repositories of

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
public data

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
that are vital to environmental health

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
research and knowledge

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
more broadly our organization aims to

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
work with the productive frictions

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
between data justice and the

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
long-standing principles of

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,479
environmental justice

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,240
environmental data justice is a movement

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,039
which calls for increased

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,239
open and participatory data to document

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,400
environmental racism and inequality

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
earlier this year we developed a group

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
within edgy called the environmental

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
enforcement watch

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,599
or ew for short here are the goals

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,239
to draw large-scale public attention to

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,280
the lack of environmental enforcement

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,599
and to inform epa visions of alternative

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
forms of public engagement

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,760
you may be wondering why now violations

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
of federal

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
environmental laws are chronic and

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
routine

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,440
former united states environmental

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,920
protection agency employees themselves

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
have spoken out in criticism of epa

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
efficacy

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
and enforcement has declined

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
precipitously under the trump

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,599
administration

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
until very recently just the beginning

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,040
of september

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
enforcement was effectively on hold due

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,959
to covet 19.

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,280
however data about environmental

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
enforcement is legally available to

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
anyone

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
the united states community right to

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
know act allows us to see all of the

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
violations

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,400
enforcement and compliance data for our

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,480
nation this data can be used to inform

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,319
our activism

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,560
specifically we can see data on the

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,159
clean water act the clean air act

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,480
and the resource conservation and

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,400
recovery act which governs hazardous

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,720
wastes in the united states

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
greenhouse gases are not regulated in

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
the united states

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
the data from the greenhouse gas

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
reporting program is available

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,920
unfortunately the data is only

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,560
accessible through an epa website called

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,319
echo

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,080
which stands for enforcement and

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
compliance online

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,519
you can find it at etho.epa.gov

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,040
but the way echo is organized is not at

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,360
all user friendly

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
only the last 12 quarters are visible

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
through the epa interface

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,879
the records going back further than that

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
are only accessible via really

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,319
complicated

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,159
csv downloads it is important to note

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,439
that the data is organized based on how

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,080
the epa itself

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
works if we ask the question who is this

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
database for

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
we can see that it's built to make it

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
easy for facilities to report

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
and specifically not to make it clear to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,000
communities what impacts they might

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
experience

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
from it this includes things like how

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,160
worried they should be about

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,759
non-compliant facilities in their areas

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
of concern

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
and if you're not an expert

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,639
understanding this data is incredibly

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
difficult

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
so what's the good news edgy has made

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
this data

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,840
easier to query to answer specific

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,040
questions people

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,600
and communities might have all workshops

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
begin

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,240
by making a customized report on

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,919
violations inspections and enforcement

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
of environmental laws in the

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,000
congressional district

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,960
state watershed or city of interest to

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
participants

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
so reports are based on data from the

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
epa's echo database

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
and are aggregated through our jupiter

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,919
notebooks edgy effectively copied the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
epa's data

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,840
into our own database hosted at stony

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,919
brook university

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,199
it is updated every two weeks we

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,680
archived it like this

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,919
instead of querying the epa directly in

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,080
case the epa decided to remove the data

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
under the new administration

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
and then we use the jupiter notebooks

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,039
written in python and hosted on google

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
co-lab

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,320
which allows people to easily pull

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
results from edgy's

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
copied echo database and create tailored

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
reports

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,479
based on state or municipality the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
notebooks allow people to identify

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,080
specific facilities

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
and areas in least compliance with these

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
federal laws

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,520
as well as add some contextual data that

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,080
helps paint a picture of what is going

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
on

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
such as demographics prison proximity

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,199
watershed and more

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
the limits are only the epa data itself

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
and as far

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,919
and as fast as we can code

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
edgy has worked with university classes

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,039
local environmental groups

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,800
and held discussions with other

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,960
environmental organizations

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
and former epa administrators using

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
these notebooks

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
one notable partner is the sunrise

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
movement the group which spearheaded the

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
green new deal

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,160
the green new deal is a congressional

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,240
resolution that lays out a grand plan

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
for the united states to tackle climate

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,720
change

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
introduced by representative alexandria

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,199
ocasio-cortez of new york

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
and the senator edward markey of

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
massachusetts the proposal calls on the

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,880
federal government

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
to wean the united states from fossil

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,160
fuels and to curb

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
planet warming greenhouse gas emissions

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
across the country

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,440
it also aims to guarantee new

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,520
high-paying jobs in clean energy

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
industries

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
now i will show you a demo of one of our

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
jupiter notebooks

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
this is our jupiter notebook which is

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
right now being hosted in

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
google collab and it was made for an

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
event in partnership with sunrise boston

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
so all of the congressional districts

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,319
have to do with massachusetts

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,199
i've gone ahead and run the first two

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
cells which just take a little bit

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
but are basically importing the main

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,080
code libraries

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,599
and then after that we can go ahead and

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
choose a congressional district to

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,000
further look at

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
and we use the folium library to create

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
these maps

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,520
um here you can hover over it and see

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,800
that this congressional district 4

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,440
8 and 7. let's say i want to take a

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
further

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
look at congressional district 4 so i

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,880
can

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,840
go to the next cell and that gives us a

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,840
drop down list of all the options

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
this next cell takes a look at what kind

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,639
of facilities the epa tracks

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,639
within this district and across

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
massachusetts so we can go ahead and run

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
this

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
this might take a little bit just

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
because it's sorting through so many

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
facilities but here we can see that

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
there are

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
24 000 facilities in massachusetts

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
currently being tracked by the echo

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,280
database

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,800
and within this district there is only 2

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,800
282. under that there's a breakdown of

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,120
how many facilities are regulated

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
under specific acts and we can take a

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
closer look at each and every one of

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,879
them

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
let's say right now we want to look at

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
the greenhouse gas emissions in this

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
district

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,599
so we can run over to the next cell and

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
choose how we want to zoom in on the

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
data

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
this is great because we get some

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
context about what the epa looks at and

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,840
everything is linked to the epa website

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
as well

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
let's run this cell

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
greenhouse gas emissions is already

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,039
chosen in the cell which is fantastic we

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
can move on to chart trends

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
so here we can look at the data from

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,080
this district compared with

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,080
massachusetts as a whole

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,000
this shows us that and then we can go

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,800
ahead and rank and map facilities within

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
this district

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
this will show us the top 20 facilities

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
but like we saw before

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
there are only 14 facilities within this

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,760
district so it shows us those

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
and then this next cell gives us a

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,839
better visualization of where these

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,839
facilities are within the congressional

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
district

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
this is nice because we can hover over

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
it and get a sense of where everything

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
is

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
this last cell just shows us how to

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,160
access our files

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
so all the images and data tables we've

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,839
created by running this notebook

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,160
can be saved and accessed at a later

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
time

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
i also wanted to talk to you about some

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
of the other notebooks we are in the

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,200
process of creating and finalizing

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
we are working on an environmental

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
justice notebook which i am so excited

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,120
about

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,959
the epa defines environmental justice as

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
the fair treatment and meaningful

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
involvement of all people with respect

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,399
to the development

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,399
implementation and enforcement of

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,560
environmental laws

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,800
edgy says that this goal will only be

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
achieved when everyone enjoys the same

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
degree of protection

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,800
from environmental and health hazards

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
and equal access to the decision-making

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
process

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,399
to have a healthy environment in which

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
to live learn and work

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
the government and corporations

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,560
perpetuate environmental racism

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
through the placement of oil pipelines

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
chemical plants

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
toxic waste dumps and polluting

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
factories which expose low-income

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,399
minority communities

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,160
to known carcinogens contaminated water

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
and other harmful pollutants

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,399
at a higher rate than predominantly

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,959
white affluent communities

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,680
this is all documented so it is critical

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,760
for us

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,000
to make that data publicly easily

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
accessible and understandable

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
the data visualizations in this

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,360
environmental justice notebook

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,279
will explore the disproportionate impact

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
of environmental hazards on people of

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
color

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,360
we are also working on a congressional

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
district report cards project

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,959
the report cards will analyze and

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
present data on violations of

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,800
environmental laws

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
inspections of polluting facilities and

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
enforcement actions

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,560
by the epa for the congressional

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,279
districts of each representative on the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,040
house energy and commerce committee

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
the goal here is to shed light on the

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
chronic and routine violations

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,160
of environmental laws and the failure to

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,240
enforce these environmental laws

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,079
the environmental enforcement watch will

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
format the data for each district and

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,040
state

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
into a public report card for release in

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,360
october

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,279
we will compile an online repository for

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
these report cards of the 76

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,320
congress people who sit on the house

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,440
energy and commerce committee

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,040
let's talk next steps

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
we really want to experiment with using

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,120
the pi spark api

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
we hope to use pi spark to avoid having

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
to maintain

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,600
either the my sequel or postgres

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,160
databases

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
with pi spark we can store the epa echo

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
csvs

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,560
in a google drive folder that is much

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,560
more intuitive to interact with

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
we hope to continue hosting

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
environmental enforcement watch events

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,200
and workshops

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
during which we discuss data science

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,279
data visualization

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,120
report making research contextualization

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
and story gathering

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
the workshops will continue documenting

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,480
and analyzing

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
all forms of environmental harms

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
including corporate and government

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
practices

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
of manipulating and withholding data as

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,240
well as government failures to

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,000
adequately collect and use data

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,320
we want to keep facilitating this

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,240
collaborative action-based research

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
that creates civic technologies

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
environmental data infrastructures

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
and equitable and transparent data care

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
practices

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
with goals of data transparency we

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,200
recognize that justice looks different

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,760
in this age of datification

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
we can use the tools at our disposal to

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,680
advocate for better data practices

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
and intelligently critique the

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,519
limitations created by this

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,079
facility-centric approach that the echo

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,959
database provides us

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,279
a long-term goal of edgy is to inform

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
epa visions of alternative forms of

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,639
public engagement

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,519
basically a green new deal of

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,839
environmental data

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,760
our projects are all open source so we

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,320
would love for you to join us and be a

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:37,720
