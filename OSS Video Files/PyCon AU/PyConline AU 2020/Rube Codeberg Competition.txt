00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,080
hi everyone and welcome to the

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,879
the judgement uh or judging i guess

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,440
uh of the the rube code web competition

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
um

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
so i have here with me the four judges

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
that have looked at all of your

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,840
submissions we have lily ryan

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
tom eastman murray macleod and russ

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
keith mcgee

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,240
um they've been spending the past

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,120
hour enjoying or being horrified by or

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
hopefully both

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,960
all of all of your lovely conditions i

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
haven't seen any of them

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,680
um i've gotten a few minor spoilers

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,360
um in the process of setting this up and

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,039
getting all the screen sharing working

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,800
um but i other than that i haven't seen

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,759
anything so i'm going to be like the

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,159
the sort of like reaction video youtuber

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,640
in the corner as they show us

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,760
everything that without that um

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,599
and as you can probably tell by

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
the amount of the amount of arms and

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
hours and the uh the untidiness of my

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
point of the wrong way

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
the untidiness of the couch behind me

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
where this is

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
as as sprint's often a little bit more

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
laid back

00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,640
than uh the the past two days

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,760
so we have yep with that said

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,200
um i am going to go over to lily ryan

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,880
who's gonna get us started awesome

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
thank you lee um yeah we we've had a

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,760
very good time

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,800
judging these um so

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,240
i've invited um tom and marin here

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,839
specifically because they were the

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
instigators of the great flip flop

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,440
reader incident of 2018

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,600
and um therefore

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
highly qualified to judge competitions

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
of this sort

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,320
um we had 17 entries that were in before

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
deadline

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
and several more that came in just after

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
the deadline which makes me sad because

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
some of them look so awesome

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
um but we we've kept it to the 17 that

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
we're in before deadline

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
um i know some of you will have had a

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,880
look at some of them uh we have had a

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,519
lot of fun

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
looking through them and we have chosen

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,839
the outcome

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,360
but before we get into it i want to read

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,640
the rules to remind you of what they

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,880
were

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
your program must print hello world on

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
the screen

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,200
somehow we don't care how it doesn't

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
have to be the console as a result of

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,079
being

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
executed it must be written for this

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
competition and to prove it you must

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
import and

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,399
use the beautiful soup library in your

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
entry i know that there was one

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,680
entry that was very cool but imported

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,480
but did not use the beautiful soup

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,760
library

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,519
and sorry it must be under 200 lines

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
all comments are part of the line count

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,800
there were some

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,279
some entries that had scripts that were

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,440
under 200 lines but also then included

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,519
many many other files that bumped it way

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,959
over 200 lines

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,000
but you know we can be a little flexible

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,240
um it must be understandable slash easy

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,279
to pass by humans

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
um which i think most of them were we we

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,959
got there

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
um it must actually run successfully

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,360
this was yeah this was interesting we

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,880
had a few

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,399
um dns issues because it's always dns

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,120
with some of the entries um

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
but we did manage to run i think all of

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
them

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
successfully must be written in python 3

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
and it must abide by the code of conduct

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
so it must be malware as far as i can

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
tell

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
none of this was malware except in in

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
the sense of it being mull in that it

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
was bad it was all very bad

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,000
and terrible is that what's been going

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,000
on with my computer since i ran that one

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,839
russ has had to reboot like three times

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,399
in the last 20 minutes yeah there's

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
either

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,640
sure it wasn't you guys we we basically

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
believe in you there's either no malware

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
or very good malware is what we're

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,880
saying yes

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,839
yes yes please like don't

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,839
don't give us where it's bad

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,560
before we go on um where have been one

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
or two questions in the chat about what

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,079
exactly the flip-flop rating

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399
is um and someone has already kindly

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
jumped in with our link to our in-joke

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,800
documentation

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,600
um but um why don't

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
tom and marin could you give us a

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
60-second overview of the flip flop

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
arena

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
will that we'll let mirin take that one

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,920
i i had nothing to do with it

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,040
that's not the lie i didn't say a word i

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,959
didn't say a

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,440
word about it a talk where he mentioned

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,639
that in ruby he learned about

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,040
uh flip floparader and uh

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,040
and ruby

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
and then he came up to me and because i

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,800
uh

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,639
you know write ruby um he asked me to

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
give a lightning talk on the topic of

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
the flip-flop operator

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,079
which is a um very rarely used well at

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,560
the time it was a very rarely used

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,480
um and deprecated function and now it's

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
not there at all um

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
but i really learned so i gave a five

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
minute talk about the

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,200
how this thing worked and i learned a

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,800
lot about the

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,440
um the cheekiness and the

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
dedication to shenanigans of the

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,600
australian python community

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,200
because there were some some truly epic

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,440
efforts to implement this um

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,360
this questionable idea of a operator and

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,320
clearly our community has not learned

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
because they came back

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,399
so i think we're really um yeah

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,519
this is showing the dedication to

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
shenanigans

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
i'm learning from from from katie

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
mclaughlin in the chat

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,600
that uh the the flips operator is

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,440
has been under deprecated is that right

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:52,240
popular demand i'm sure

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
i don't i know miriam is now cited as as

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
a source on wikipedia

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,760
um as a result of that that talk as well

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,079
um

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,199
but um i didn't know that either if you

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,680
would like to know more about the pixel

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,680
operator

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
if you go to that link uh the culture

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,560
link that was posted earlier in the chat

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,040
i'm sure someone will post it again

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
very shortly um there is a direct link

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
to both

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,440
the original talk and the talk where

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
mirren tom and zach hadfield dodds who

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
isn't on this call

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,199
uh points out the ruby developers

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,760
flip-flopped on the decision

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,760
oh kathy oh

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,560
betsy's impressed okay so

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,199
the fifth operator it happens in 2018.

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,720
today we are doing something far more

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,240
simple we are doing hello world

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
so shall we kick shall we kick off

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,130
hello world to its credit has not been

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,839
deprecated

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:54,480
[Laughter]

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,760
who are we looking at first um well i

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
thought what i might do is

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,920
uh go around each of the judges and get

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
them to talk about one of the entries

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,600
that they enjoyed the most

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,519
because we had such a good time looking

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,480
through all of these which is why

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
we were running a little late here um so

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
tom

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
would you mind kicking off what did you

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,160
enjoy the most

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,800
um out of the ones that we have you know

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,360
okay so we had we yeah we had we had a

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
couple

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
um categories of things to happen and so

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
i just want to give a shout out to there

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
was an idea that came up a bunch of

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
times which was um

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,480
trolling through uh web pages like

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,600
um wikipedia to find

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
either the words hello and world um to

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,920
pull out

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,079
or um or

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,079
i think a lot of people really went to

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,800
the literal extent of the rules

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
and used beautiful soup to go to the

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,959
rules page

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,839
to grab the string hello world out of

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,800
the rules for the competition which i i

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
felt was

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,199
the most beautifully literal

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,639
interpretation of please print the

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,759
string hello world

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,839
you got what we we got what we have this

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
one here

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,120
so there was there was there was several

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
entries that did that and i want to i

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,839
want to shout them out

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
the one that i want to demonstrate for

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,120
people is the entry by james constable

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,279
so um if my terminal window

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
if my terminal window is visible okay

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
cool

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,880
so we have we have we have

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
rube codeberg right here and i'm going

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,560
to

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,519
run it

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,880
okay it works as advertised it it does

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,160
the thing i used

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
sorry just to prove to you that that was

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,680
python three python three

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,040
runs it okay cool let's just make sure

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,800
that it is the right

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,320
length we'll do a word count on it

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,199
um it is 199 lines so it is

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,839
just right there okay so let's just look

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,839
at the source code

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,160
what you're looking what you're looking

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,839
at here what you're looking at here

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,039
is an entire maze

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,120
encoded in the comments

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,240
to the left to the right of the source

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,000
code

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,120
now you'll see that the maze

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,919
has html characters in it

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,720
but you'll see that there's a giant p

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,400
there

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,160
y c o n

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:47,280
a u 20 20.

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,600
right down here on the on the 199th line

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
um

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
this is why we didn't tell them

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
it works by doing a depth first maze

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
traversal

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,799
all the way through the maze and picking

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,039
up the characters as it goes along

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,840
just like pac-man it eats up an html

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,160
file

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,760
and then it prints out the html file and

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,960
it uses beautiful soup to parse it and

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,440
it spits out the title

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,280
and the title is hello world and that is

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,880
just magnificent

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,640
however these are not doc strings

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
it's not a well-documented program i'm

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,160
really sorry james you

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,120
you you came so close it was magnificent

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,840
but

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
oh man you got to document your code

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
dude

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,080
[Music]

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
that was my that was my favorite i

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
really wanted to shout that one out

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,320
before we get to the winners who

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,559
who would like to show one off next um

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,679
russ do you want to go next uh i won't i

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,720
won't show off uh

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,160
um i will however point out a couple of

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,880
the couple of uh entrants

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,960
did uh thoroughly embrace the the

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
enterprise nature of what we're talking

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
about here

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
uh we had a couple of entries that

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
generated

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,679
uh html documents or xml

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,160
sgml documents that registered entities

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,919
for the characters and then would use

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
beautiful soup to pull out the counts of

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
the

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,960
character and and uh entities that were

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
in the document and use that to look up

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
in an ascii table

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,600
which i think should deserve to be

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
thoroughly uh uh supported as an

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,080
enterprise activity

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,640
um there's also uh only one applicant

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,679
who

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,160
who generated a a full test suite for

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,760
their code inside the 199 characters so

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
uh so brian may

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,200
uh did generate a full test suite fully

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,799
not complete coverage of test of code so

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,120
possible deduction of marks there for

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,760
not not full coverage

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,039
but having coverage at all 78 and some

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
of those may have been blank lines

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,160
like we had to couldn't really dig into

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
exactly why they were getting the test

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
failures but

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,240
you got to test i do think exactly well

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
exactly but

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
it's very honorable that you went to the

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,280
effort of testing at all

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,240
trevor peacock's entry also had tests in

00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,840
it

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,919
oh did i miss the test i don't know if

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,440
we didn't check sorry

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,159
yes oh i don't think we did coverage

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,159
checks on that but it did have tests

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,440
i do apologize trevor you also get a

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
gold star for testing

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
the title sounds yes

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
zach wants to know if the tests were

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,039
written by hand or generated as well

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,360
they they were not hypothesis tests no

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,440
so we there is no no fuzzing or any any

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,960
confirmation here so zacchaeus you know

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
i'm afraid

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,520
these these may have edge cases that are

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
not being caught

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,960
we need to run high high quality from

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
our

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,559
terrible silly code indeed indeed

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,720
um are there any that you looked at that

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,840
you want to call out specifically before

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,240
we get on to our um

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,960
finalists so with the

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,159
the name of the um the the competition

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,280
the um

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,320
i felt that there were a number of

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,159
entrants that really um evoked the

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,360
spirit of a rube goldberg machine

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,480
by going to ridiculous lengths

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,360
to do a very simple activity um and

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,600
often

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,360
you know in quite a beautiful and

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
thorough way and some of the um

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,799
some of the same ways that some of the

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,080
same ones that that tom

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,559
and um and russell have pointed out um

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,559
i'll see if i can um

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,360
uh oh bring up um

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,640
yarkov's one can you see my screen can i

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,120
share that

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,559
uh yep i just gotta press the button i

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,360
think i might have actually

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,640
um made some kind of mistake in my

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,640
terminal window because it didn't used

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,120
to look this cool when it came out

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
uh before until i increased the font

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
size but if i go

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,799
like this um you can see the

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,640
the intensity of the uh

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,080
the programming that's going on here

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,960
there's some kind of

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,960
uh some kind of hash deep

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
and you know what i respect that

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,799
uh so there are a couple of there are a

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,679
couple of them that had um

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,440
some slightly different uh some slightly

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960
different outputs so it wasn't

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,480
quite a lot of them just said hello

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,480
world in the output just hello

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
sorry katie has just posted curly queen

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
in the chat which is we need to we need

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
to

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,400
i love it yeah yeah

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,760
uh but some of them did it a little bit

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,360
more interestingly

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,000
so um should i demonstrate uh

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,440
i can't actually remember who's this is

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:55,840
but

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:55,840
uh oh no sorry that small one

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,120
looks really neat in the terminal and

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,840
also

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,840
is running um running a server

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
okay yeah so hang on hang on yeah this

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,840
one this one

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,440
this is uh andrew mcgee i believe

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,640
yeah yeah okay i feel like i feel like

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
we should just page through the source

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
code just quickly to

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,200
to to show what's happening here because

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,159
what's happening here is

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,840
bat is bad i was about to say that

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,039
bat guano so what's happening here is

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,039
that guano should we shall we switch

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,960
let me just okay so i don't know what's

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,720
going on with this first part

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
it's got some list stuff a lot of people

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,440
have like crazy this stuff okay

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,120
but but i i thank you for the

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
documentation it's not dog strings but i

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,640
like dark strings but anyway

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
okay so unpacking the dictionary in the

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,880
list of lines we can print

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,360
then we are constructing html out of

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
that

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,919
but we want to make sure the output is

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,440
pretty so we use beautiful soup to

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,000
prettify the html

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,600
then we spin up a web server so we spin

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
up a web server to serve up the html

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
that we just uh

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,799
brought up but rather than use requests

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
to fetch the uh

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,200
to fetch the html we we spin up our own

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,919
terminals

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,559
our own telnet server sorry telnet

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,080
client

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,720
to connect to our http server

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,720
in a thread

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,400
okay and then we retrieve the pretty

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,240
html we process it into a list of line

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,720
index character tuples

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,120
and then we shuffle all of those and we

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,400
pull up the curly boy color scheme

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,960
kudos for that curly boy colors in

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,880
in terminal escape codes we randomize

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
them with some extra bits and pieces

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,400
we have some software engineering here

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,760
because you can tell it's software

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,080
engineering because it's a

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,039
curly boy color getter factory factory

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,440
factory

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:05,039
um some other stuff happens

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,520
i lose track of time and what you get

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,919
is that magnificent sparkling um

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,440
sparkling hello world so so that is

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,640
spectacular well done that's

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,880
gorgeous um and

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,480
um this leads me to my next point which

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,799
is that we had so

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,520
many good entries that we could not

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,279
choose a single winner we chose three

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,320
um and this was one of them so andrew

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,880
mcgee

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
with sparkly telnet thank you and

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,320
congrats because you are

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,600
the first winner of the first rupa

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,799
competition ever um

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,320
so the second winner

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,679
um which is yeah um

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,080
russ you have uh you have a bit of a

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,760
you have the physical uh yes we have we

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,440
have yes so this is a case of uh be

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,520
careful what you ask for

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,799
uh because we asked someone to print

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,080
hello world

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,440
and so they printed hello world

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,919
uh they they actually opened up a uh

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,360
a browser put a document a html document

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,120
with a with an svg

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,640
uh curly boy across the bottom of the

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
page which you probably see if i hold a

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,919
little closer

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,840
uh and then and then directed the the

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
web browser to open its print dialogue

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,080
which

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,360
i was able to spit out at the printer

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,840
down the hall uh

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,440
so yes uh so badly horrible uh

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
absolutely gave us exactly what we

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,880
wanted uh we got a printed hello world

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,440
they printed out the world successfully

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,640
they they when they they went a

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,400
win one of the coveted prizes as well

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,279
um and i'm sorry can we just

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,039
uh uh and once again looking at the

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
attendee chat draw attention to the fact

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,240
that of all of the presenters uh thanks

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,279
katie for pointing this out bus is the

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,279
one that has a printer

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,200
i feel like i'm enterprise grade i'm

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,039
telling you i was astonished too

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
yeah genuinely children who are of

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,960
school age so

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,559
i'm pretty sure this is the oldest one

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,200
in this chat right so like he'd be the

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
one with the printer

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,559
i am business dad i think i think you

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,919
also

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,559
are the person who should take us

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,399
through um

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,919
oh i don't have the source code oh yeah

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,320
ready to write the last one i think i

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,080
think

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,679
oh yeah sorry you went on a little bit

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
of an adventure so how about you take us

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,039
through how this last one was

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,080
implemented and you tell us all about it

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,720
right okay so uh the the last winner

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,760
is uh cynthia del rio uh who who wins an

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,120
award for the most

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,799
thorough usage of object orientation uh

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,279
they've they have gone to the levels of

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,279
defining classes for each of the of the

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,200
letters that are being printed

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,960
uh which when instantiated uh

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
print themselves appropriately but don't

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
just print themselves they also go

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
through the process

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,799
of rendering themselves through uh

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,320
through a factory mechanism

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,840
to make sure that they've been printed

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,720
uh appropriately and and

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,159
and prettily uh they they go and they

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,600
get the character they they

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,480
they go they generate each character as

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,840
uh an ascii art uh letter and then

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,440
prints it banister like a vertical

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,760
banner style um

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,799
but every time that it does it it uses a

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,279
different font

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,960
for every character so you get a

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,159
different rendering every time you print

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
hello world

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,600
uh which i think marion you had you had

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,720
the the sample text

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
did you have it there or yep

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,640
that's the button yeah so here we go

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,720
so can you embed in that please man

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,600
that's magnificent

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,039
so if we have a look at each of these

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
and it does it differently

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
uh each time that it's font every time

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,279
yep

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,080
yeah so we've got this lovely l r

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,559
oh this is i guess you could call that a

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
w

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,919
yeah uh a different o

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,520
um that's quite a nice h we run it again

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,399
um we've got some oh that's a very good

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
r

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,919
different o tiny little oh yes

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,600
so truly like some some wonderful

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,720
typography

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,320
at uh at work unless yes

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,679
in this machine amazing

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,279
yeah so um that those are our three

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,320
winners so we have cynthia del rio

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,600
andrew mcgee and

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,440
buddy harborough and uh we are

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,039
really really pleased with all of the

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
entries we got we wish we could have

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
seen

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,559
all the ones that snuck in after the

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,120
deadline as well because

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
they looked i think that was a cli game

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,240
got mentioned

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,240
a couple of other things which sound

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,120
amazing

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,159
um but yeah um i wasn't even sure that

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,960
anyone was going to enter the

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,240
competition

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,520
but i clearly underestimated the um

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
the appetite of this audience for

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,840
shenanigans so

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,600
a very good time this afternoon and my

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,159
dog wants to play now okay

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,679
i'm so so glad that we did this thank

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
you so much lily

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,000
for organizing this and putting this

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,120
together um at the 11th hour

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,640
and thank you tom marin and russ for

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,440
helping judge and thank you everyone

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,720
that entered this is

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,159
ridiculous oh yeah that's right adam's

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
saying in the chat if you want to run

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,159
adams

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,919
um it will only work today

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,679
and it's impossible that it might not

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,679
work at all if you if you have some

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,559
particular dns

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,360
problems yeah no no adam adam we need to

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,679
we need to talk

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,720
because um is this an honorable mention

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,000
are we going to go through this on on

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
stream

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
oh yes honorable [ __ ] yes we can

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,240
definitely point this one out

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,039
um i tried to run it first and it didn't

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,760
work

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,080
and i couldn't it turns out yeah so it's

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,559
not

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,200
like and i'm on mac and and tom's on on

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,799
unix so

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,039
it wasn't that but for some reason

00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,919
example.org

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,360
doesn't resolve on some computers and i

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,039
first i thought it was just because the

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,159
gremlins that are in my computer at the

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,679
moment but no it's

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,200
my gremlins are so good they got into

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,000
tom's computer so

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,559
adam's adam's entry requires being able

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
to

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,320
fetch html from example.org from

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,370
okay i think i think systemd won't let

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,650
me or something

00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,279
[Laughter]

00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,360
[Applause]

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,279
um yeah and someone's asking if there's

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,640
a list of all the submissions um you can

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,679
have a look in the rube

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,799
code submissions channel

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,720

this and venueless is reloading uh

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,000

22nd delay uh and he's posting uh in all

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,440
capital caps

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,840
what i preached example. because it

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,840
works

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,640
it was dns it was always dns

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,840
i'm gonna think of a special um special

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,840
mention for flakiness

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,159
yeah there's no example.org on on my

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,399
browser

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,600
on on firefox or chrome it ain't there

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
yeah

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,279
um no and it wasn't dub the dub versus

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,919
no dub dub dub and it wasn't we tried

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,080
that

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,880
um it was just um if you if you told me

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,279
yeah i have no examples i don't know

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
what to say

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,120
anyway we're less of a bad example and

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,120
more of a horrible warning

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
tobias would like to remind us all that

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,799
the real dns

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,240
was the one that we found along the way

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:01,120
and then we've got some people pasting

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
an rfc into the chat for this is what

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
happens

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,720
which will be the example now you know

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,039
it's getting serious

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
yeah where people are facing some rules

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,919
lawyers kicking in here

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,120

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,840
dns set might be a bit broken with

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
example.org

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,480

that where

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,280
bugs in rfcs relating to dns

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
are out of scope for the hello world

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,640
competition is a sentence that makes

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,640
sense and i
