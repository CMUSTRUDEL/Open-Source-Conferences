We've all done it. Setting up a Slack to chat to our colleagues when the proper system doesn't cut it. Forwarding a document from work to our personal email address so we can read it on the device we want to. Building out experimental services on our personal AWS accounts because we couldn't get the permissions we needed on the company's systems.

Every organisation's infrastructure has its shadow, the unofficial system of servers, accounts, and hardware that crisscrosses and bypasses the sanctioned pathways. It is every security department's nightmare and every development team's open secret. From the newest graduate to the CEO, we all know at least some of these shortcuts.

This talk is a space for both confession and redemption: in it, we will delve into the psychology that leads to the development of shadow IT, the opportunities that can grow out of this corporate underground, and how to get these systems out of the shadows and into the light. Developers and security professionals alike will emerge from this talk with the tools they need to build the systems they actually want.

icon line 20 20. um

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
it is really nice to be here with you

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,559
and hopefully

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,639
be heard by you even if um being here is

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,040
really my house where i've been hanging

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,960
out for the last six months anyway

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
but it is really nice to be here with

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
you more to the point

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
um i'm lily ryan i am a penetration

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
tester from melbourne

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,240
a board member of digital rights watch

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,960
australia a former historian

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,720
and a current cyborg this is also the

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,359
first talk that i'm delivering to a

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
camera

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
instead of a live audience in the same

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
room so i apologize

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
if my delivery's a little awkward and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
rough around the edges

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
everything is a learning experience and

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
before that you panic

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,760
before we panic that our av setup is

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,800
having any problems besides the sound

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,800
no i do not have any slides i don't know

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,719
about you but i've spent most of 2020

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
looking at a screen so for this talk i

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
would like to give you

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
the chance to give your eyes a break

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
just look out the window um

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,760
watch the birds in the clouds whatever

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,199
you have available to you and listen to

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,559
this talk instead

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,119
or swap to one of the other talks you

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,280
know i mean i'm not going to judge

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,040
today's topic is what we do in the

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
shadows where we're going to dig into

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
the motivations behind the creation of

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,119
underground corporate infrastructure

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
what's commonly known as shadow i.t

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,560
and how we can create workplaces where

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
we shouldn't have to feel like we need

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
to work around the official channels

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,799
just to get things done

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
initially i was intending to make a

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
bunch of vampire jokes

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
because the title kind of lends itself

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,159
to that theme but to be honest the more

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,320
that i wrote about the topic the more i

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
realized that the vampire theme

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
wasn't going to fit no matter how i made

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
it i tried to make it and

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,600
given that we're in the 20s again i

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
decided that it made more sense

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
to talk about this topic through the

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,560
lens of prohibition in the united states

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
in the 1920s

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
because i feel like 100 years is a nice

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
time for check-in point

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
and i cannot resist the historical

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,360
analogy which many of you will know

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,399
anyway more about that later

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,960
firstly what is shadow i.t

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
it gets called many things shadow i.t

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,000
shadow infrastructure

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
feral i.t or my personal favorite

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
hedge info all right hair jennifer is

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
not actually a thing that people say

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
whatever name you use for this concept

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
it's referring to the unofficial

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,599
system of software infrastructure and

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
services that people in organizations

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,120
set up of their own accord that exist

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,800
outside the purview of the usual it team

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,239
and this could be things like the

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
whatsapp group that you chat your

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
colleagues in and use to coordinate

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
coffee breaks

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
the dropbox account or the google drive

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
folder where you and your teammates

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,440
share files that you want to access

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,599
outside of work

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
the personal aws account of one of the

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,319
devs which was used to experiment with

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
new infra because

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
requesting company resources was taking

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,840
too long

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,440
or the slack instance that someone set

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
up for your workplace that nobody's

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
actually paying for because it's too

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
expensive

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,080
as an aside i'm pretty convinced that

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,360
the majority of slack's business model

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
is getting people to sign their

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,440
organizations up with the free thing and

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,040
then

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
being so useful and awesome and

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
indispensable to the internal

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
collaborative process that

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
the companies eventually forced to pay

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
the incredibly expensive percy costs

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
or risk another company holding

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,560
everything but the last ten thousand

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,400
messages hostage

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,720
but i digress shadow i.t

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
is all this stuff that's kind of cobbled

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
together around the edges for

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,080
convenience or out of desperation

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
that nobody's supposed to talk about but

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,799
somehow everybody from the grads to the

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,080
execs has used in some form or another

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,920
maybe without even realizing speaking of

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
someone whose job it is to investigate

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
systems and report on the existence of

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
things like this

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
shadow infra is also a security team's

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
worst

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,959
nightmare if the company can't control

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
the systems that are being used to

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
transmit sensitive information

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,879
whether that's actual confidential data

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
or just leaking interesting information

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,599
about business processes

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
then they have no way of realistically

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,799
containing data breaches or

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
patching the things that are being used

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,840
or making sure that people are removed

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
from the system

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,159
when they leave the company and yet

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
security teams are also made of humans

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,000
you probably find us on the unofficial

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
slack as well we get frustrated by

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,040
opaque processes and rules

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,120
just like everybody else sometimes

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
we end up being the prohibition era cops

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
drinking cocktails at the speakeasies

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
after hours

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
just like everyone else which brings me

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,040
to prohibition

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,520
so for historical context in january

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
1920 the 18th amendment to the u.s

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,199
constitution came into effect

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
banning the sale and manufacture of

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
alcohol in the united states

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,919
this amendment had come about as the

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,560
result of decades of campaigning on a

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,360
complex a complex tangle of issues

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
moral arguments around alcohol is a vice

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
the need to deal with

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
uh the toxic culture that's centered

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
around saloons

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and the rate of crime domestic violence

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
and abuse that was linked to executive

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,919
drinking

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
prohibition was hailed by many as the

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,120
noble experiment

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
it was a way to solve all of america's

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,680
problems at once

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,320
but by 1933 it had been repealed by the

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,400
passage of the 21st amendment

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
and when we think of the 1920s now we

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,160
might think of

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,400
al capone or moonshine flappers and jazz

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
of speakeasies and decadent parties and

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
fancy cocktails

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
and we associate this era of what was

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
supposed to be

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
the golden age of temperance with these

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,800
kinds of things

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
because the business of alcohol drinking

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,639
never stopped

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
many people made bank on selling bootleg

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
liquor all up and down the country

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,080
and those affected by alcoholism only

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,199
became more desperate as they were

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
denied real help

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
and forced into illegal situations that

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
often put them at greater risk than

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,880
before

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
like any analogy this analogy is not

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
perfect

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,440
by a long shot my time slot today isn't

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,199
infinite so

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,199
i'm going to be glossing a whole lot of

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,400
extremely complex topics in historical

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,840
events which means

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
there are points that i'd really love to

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
get into discussion with you about and

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
the questions in the hallway track

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
afterwards

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,520
but i like analogies anyway and the

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
story of what happened with prohibition

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
in the 1920s in the united states

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,720
has a great deal in common with that

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
document that you just forwarded to

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,360
yourself

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
out of your work email so that you could

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
access it on another computer

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,440
strict rules implemented without

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,919
consideration of for reality

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
often force very human behaviors into

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,800
the shadows and create a totally

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
different sometimes set of more

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
difficult problems than the initial one

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,520
that they tried to solve

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
so when you've got when you have

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
security procedures

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
blocking your actual work left and right

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
it's pretty easy to get frustrated

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,720
and wonder who they're actually

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
protecting and why they're there

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,520
i'm willing to bet that there's a

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
non-zero number of you listening to me

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
right now who have been frustrated

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
by a company laptop that has the usb

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
ports disabled because

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,479
viruses or something but that really

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
means that you can't get a copy of the

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,960
document to the person who needs it to

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
do their job or having to fill out two

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,880
separate forms to try and get permission

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
to install a program on your own machine

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
something that you need to do your job

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,400
today but that probably won't be seen by

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
anybody until next week

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,240
because bureaucracies are like that by

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
which time the concept that you needed

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,639
to prove

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
or the deadline that you needed to meet

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,199
has passed

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,280
it works quickly bureaucracies often

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,360
don't it turns out to be easier to go

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
rogue and share a snippet on github than

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,240
to wait for your account to be given

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,639
commit access to the repo that you need

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
plus anyone with a background in user

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
experience

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,440
is probably itching to tell you that the

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
data that we get from examining what

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
people

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,599
actually do in the shadows can lead to

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,319
really important insights about the way

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,080
that people want to work together

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,680
ux specialists have been talking about

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
this since forever

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
by observing how people actually work

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,759
with your systems you can get an idea of

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
what they expect

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
to be able to do and then go and build

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
that thing to support them

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
you might hear people talk about desire

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
parts in this context

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
a desire path is that patch of bald

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
ground worn by the feet of thousands of

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
people

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,560
taking the same shortcuts every day

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
between paved walkways

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,759
some public planners have started to

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
pave these over to create better

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
resources for people to get

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,759
where they're already going other

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,680
planners even let their population

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
do the planning for them at one

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
university in in the united states they

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,720
didn't build any parts across one part

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
of the campus

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
at any at all for an entire semester

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,880
they waited for the desire paths to form

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959
naturally as students went about their

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,519
day and then they paved them all

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,479
to make them official so this is a

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,360
pretty 101

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
ux concept but security is also kind of

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
infamous for its lack of user experience

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
consideration

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
when our job is to see adversaries

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
everywhere

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
we often think about what we need to

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,480
prevent well before we realize what we

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,440
need to allow if we

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,040
take the time to think about it at all

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
and if we live in this mode long enough

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
we might sometimes forget to take that

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
security hat

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
off and think about it like a normal

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,880
human

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,640
so we block and we ban and we prohibit

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,800
the thing about prohibition is though

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,959
that it never really works

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
it's a time-tested economic principle if

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,959
you ban something that was providing a

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,720
mutually beneficial exchange in some way

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
the ban will most likely fail to achieve

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
its goal

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
the lesson that came out of the 1920s in

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
the u.s was that if you crack down

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
really hard on a particular thing

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,519
then you end up creating an underground

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
where that particular thing becomes less

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
regulated and even more dangerous

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,360
even if it looks like by some metrics

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
you might be succeeding in your original

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200
goals

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,200
by criminalizing the sale of alcohol

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
prohibition advocates were actually

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
successful in reducing the per capita

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
rate of alcohol consumption

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,800
simply because alcohol was harder to

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,240
come by rates of absenteeism at work

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,399
also plummeted as it became

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
more difficult to openly justify time

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
off due to drunkenness

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
or having a hangover that you weren't

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,120
supposed to have

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
several alcohol-related health issues

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,519
like liver disease also declined

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,680
but as it became illegal to produce

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,279
things like beer with a lower alcohol

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,440
content it meant that when people

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,440
did drink they ended up drinking things

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
like moonshine and strong spirits that

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,399
were easier to distill quickly and in

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
secret

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
they got drunker faster and sometimes

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,600
without intending to

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,440
or realizing the impact that that drink

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
was going to have

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,680
people also ended up drinking industrial

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,760
alcohol which was still legal to produce

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
and when they did they often ended up

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,120
severely ill

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,880
blind or dead because of the poisons

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
that were introduced into the alcohol by

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
the government to try and make it

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
undrinkable

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
and jail cells and criminal courts

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
around the country filled up at

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
ridiculously high rates

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
and developed incredible backlogs due to

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,560
the increased number of alcohol-related

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
arrests

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
arrests which also predominantly

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,079
targeted people of color and other

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,839
minority communities

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,519
it's hard to tell just how much

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,320
prohibition actually increased

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,920
corruption and criminal behavior because

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,000
a lot of speakeasies and bootleg

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,320
operations didn't keep good records

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
because they weren't supposed to exist

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
but the fact that we still associate the

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,360
time period with guns and gangs should

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
tell you something about the way this

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
behavior permeated the public

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
consciousness

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
it's also really hard to get data on how

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,079
much shadow i.t exists or how far

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
it reaches because when these systems

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
are banned outright

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
they're forced to exist outside of

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
official boundaries and the lack of data

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,200
makes it harder to work out what people

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
want to be able to do in the workplace

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
or to get the benefits out of these

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
systems because we have

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
no easy way to measure digital desire

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
paths the way that a town planner might

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,040
see the tracks across a public park

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,959
so we don't know what we need to support

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
and by banning these things we end up

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,640
creating

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,399
backlogs for ourselves if we block usb

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
ports on laptops we push people towards

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,360
setting up dropbox accounts to share the

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,560
documents the way they want to

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
and vice versa if we block both people

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
might just start using

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
a different laptop entirely or really at

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
the end of the day they quit the

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,040
organization and we lose

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,760
a good worker i don't know about the

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
rest of you

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
who work in the security industry but i

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,399
don't think that most people get

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
into infosec to become life ruiners who

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,760
ruin lives

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
um sure we don't all work in corporate

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
i.t security teams because this is a

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,839
very large discipline but

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
a lot of us do end up there and while

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
you do occasionally get

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
unlucky in an orc and end up dealing

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
with a security team that contains

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
paranoid people on a power trip

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,079
more often than not the team is

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
implementing their rules for a reason

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,200
to understand it it might just be that

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
we need to think our way into their

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,079
perspective

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,600
it is literally the security team's job

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,680
to protect their organization from

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
hackers information leaks and

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
attacks and like most fundamental roles

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
it's most noticeable

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,839
when it fails and your organization ends

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,120
up on the front page of the internet

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,519
while you might be frustrated with

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,519
things like multi-factor authentication

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,560
in order to access your email or having

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
to request

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
access to install a program you probably

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,880
aren't seeing the mail rules that stop

00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,920
your inboxes filling up with get rich

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,079
quick spam or

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,279
having your services constantly taken

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,760
down by drive by script kitty attacks

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
you're most likely concerned and rightly

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
so

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,160
with making sure that you and your team

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,839
can do what you do easily

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,680
but a good security team will be

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
thinking about organizational risk

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,040
management as a whole

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,839
and trying to balance those larger scale

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,480
needs against the more specific use case

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
that you might personally have and while

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
amendments and exceptions can and should

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,200
be made because

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
policy should be a living document not

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
holy scripture

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,680
it's not always practical or possible to

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
think of

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
all of them ahead of time so you end up

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,480
with having to request

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
special permission for things you need

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
to do your specific job

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
which can sometimes take longer than you

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
want

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,639
from this side of history it can be hard

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
to make sense of why

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
the prohibition laws of the 1920s were

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,959
actually considered at all

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,480
let alone how they passed it's easy for

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
us to only see the particular brand of

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,199
corruption and hypocrisy that grew out

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,959
of this situation

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,279
the politicians who wrote prohibition

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
into law stockpiling expensive liquor

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,680
for their own personal

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
use before their own laws came into

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
effect for example

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
but you don't get an amendment to the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
u.s constitution just because

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,440
there were plenty of people from all

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,360
parts of the political spectrum

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
who advocated for prohibition for a

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
plethora of reasons

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
and had been doing so for over a century

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,880
to that point

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
one of the things people often forget is

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
that many of the folks who supported

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,199
prohibition

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
were first-wave feminists who fought

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,560
equally as hard for the women for

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
women's right to vote as they did for

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
closing down distilleries

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,920
this wasn't just a matter of women's

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,160
delicate sensibilities or

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,600
rigid ideas about morals although those

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
things definitely played into the

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
campaign

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,480
but because the problem of alcoholism

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,399
and domestic violence that drunkenness

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
could exacerbate was an exceedingly

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
gendered one

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,360
and women and children who often weren't

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
permitted into the spaces where alcohol

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
was served and consumed

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
were sometimes only ever seeing the men

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
in their lives coming home drunk

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
sometimes unable to work and in the

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
worst cases violent

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
because divorces weren't easy to get in

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
those days and because it wasn't

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
easy for women to earn enough of an

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,279
income by themselves

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,320
to support a family banning the sale of

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
alcohol was seen

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
as a way of resolving the situation if

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
people couldn't get drunk

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,320
then it followed all the other issues

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,560
linked to alcohol would also go away

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
and it seems like a simplistic way of

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
looking at things to us now

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
knowing what we know about how events

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,040
transpired but

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,759
it's important to understand how

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,839
tempting it is to feel like

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
things might be able to be solved in

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
such a straightforward way as just

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,600
banning the behavior without actually

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,800
addressing

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,240
it wasn't as though the women of the

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,440
time were prayed to this kind of magical

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,199
thinking either

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,199
for many of them it was the only level

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
they had the power to pull

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,560
white women were only granted the right

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
to vote the same year that prohibition

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,519
came into effect and for women of color

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,199
and many others it took

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,639
far far longer and all women were still

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,720
subject to social structures and

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,040
expectations that kept them in the home

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,519
as mothers rather than being able to

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,360
choose their own paths through life

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,040
campaigning for prohibition gave women a

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,199
socially acceptable pathway into

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,560
politics for basically the first time in

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,000
the united states

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,920
and among many there was the hope that

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
after prohibition they would have laid

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,199
the foundations to make many more

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,880
nuanced changes that would benefit

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,320
everyone

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
the rules that end up being enforced in

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
our workplaces might also seem too

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
simplistic and broad and naive

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,519
but sometimes these too are because they

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
were the only lever that someone could

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,880
pull

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,000
workplace politics is in some ways even

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,639
more cutthroat than

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
actual politics people go in with the

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
best of intentions

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,320
but they have to start from somewhere oh

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,000
they have to start from somewhere

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
and hope that they can do the best they

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,680
can with the tools that are available to

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
them even if that tool is a blunt

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,160
instrument

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,399
so yeah at the end of the day

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
the 18th amendment was repealed and in

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,800
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,199
people were legally allowed to

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,199
manufacture and sell alcohol again

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,800
prohibition had partially solved some of

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,720
the issues that it had set out to solve

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
but it simply didn't work in terms of

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
stopping people drinking

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,199
and in many cases it created even bigger

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,959
problems

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,520
and then made it illegal or difficult to

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,679
talk about them and address them openly

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,439
it still stands in the history books as

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,520
the only time an amendment to the u.s

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,799
constitution was ever repealed which is

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,319
generally considered a

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,000
pretty big deal in my view

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,400
one of the most important things that we

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,079
can take out of prohibitions repeal

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,720
that applies equally well to tackling

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,679
the problem of shadow i.t is this

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,960
complex problems require multifaceted

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,280
solutions

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,039
and active informed collaboration in

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,799
order to be addressed

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,880
this means that broad solutions are

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
always going to be kind of broken

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
and will never really address what

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
they're intended to address no matter

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
how

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
people care prohibition wasn't just

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
trying to solve the problem of

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,640
alcohol it was trying to solve the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
problems of women's rights domestic

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,559
violence

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,880
addiction ethnicity class race poverty

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,440
morality religion

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
issues that we have by no means solve

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,160
today

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,440
similarly shadow i.t isn't really just

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,760
one problem

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
it's about accessibility security

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,480
convenience

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,720
collaboration needs organizational

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
politics and it's often juggling a

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,480
complex mesh

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,160
of threat models some of which conflict

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
with each other so external threats such

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
as

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,080
hackers nation states corporate spies

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,840
and competitors

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,039
internal threats such as disgruntled

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
employees honest mistakes opportunism

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,960
we solve this not by enacting blanket

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,280
bans or blocks but by addressing

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
individual problems as they come up

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,640
no matter whether you work in security

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,120
or you work as a developer

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
or you work in a totally different role

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,919
here are the main things that i'd like

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
you to take away and think about from

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
this whole

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
bucket of ideas and analogies we've just

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,440
meandered through

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,280
one banning things outright doesn't work

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,960
prohibition is one example but there are

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,760
many others throughout history recent

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,039
and ancient you just have to look

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,039
two most problems aren't a one-and-done

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
kind of thing they're ongoing

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,320
maintenance issues and they need to be

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,400
treated that way

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,679
security policies need updating and

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
regular care just like

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,679
getting a haircut or mowing the lawn

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,760
times change

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,520
tech changes and the way people want to

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
work with each other changes

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,960
so good security policies should be

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
living documents with space for all the

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,720
messy and brilliant

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,600
things that human beings are rather than

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,760
unchanging gospel

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,000
three it's important to try and

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,320
understand the perspectives of others

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,160
this doesn't just apply to work but it

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
definitely does apply here

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
sometimes you might reflect on a rule

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
and suddenly realize what the rule is

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,760
actually trying to solve

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,760
sometimes though a security rule might

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
be unnecessarily burdensome

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,880
and sometimes the security team might

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,200
think so too

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
perhap but perhaps it's the only lever

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,280
that was available

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,720
for them to pull at that time see if

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
you can work with them to address the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
actual issue see what's blocking them

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,320
from making more practical rules

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,679
it might be a policy that was imposed on

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,280
the business a long time ago and has

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,120
never been updated

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,960
maybe it was a policy framework that was

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,600
never even tailored for your business at

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
all

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,720
lots of frameworks suffer from

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,000
boilerplate applications in places that

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
they don't really fit

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,039
see if you can work together to

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,440
understand everyone's needs and make the

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,840
thing

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,480
fit properly and on that note four

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,000
the best approaches aren't authoritative

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,000
they're collaborative

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,280
if your security team is behaving like

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
the computer police

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
blocking everything they're not going to

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,960
be doing the best job that they could be

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
and most of the time they probably don't

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,039
want to be behaving like that anyway

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
ideally we should be able to see each

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,120
other as partners with a common goal

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,559
rather than adversaries it's going to be

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,679
a different starting point for every

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,600
organization but

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,080
have a think about what you can do to

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,559
get to that place

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,400
this talk isn't intended to be an

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,200
exhaustive exploration of the topic of

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,520
shadow i.t

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,760
and definitely not the full story about

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
that or about prohibition

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,120
but the topic is one that i feel very

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,200
passionately about

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,320
so i'm hoping that you'll all have a lot

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
of questions and thoughts for me

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,760
afterwards because i would really like

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,520
to continue discussing it

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,320

thank you so much for that enlightening

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,880
talk despite the tech issues you handled

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,240
that like an absolute champion

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,480

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,080
