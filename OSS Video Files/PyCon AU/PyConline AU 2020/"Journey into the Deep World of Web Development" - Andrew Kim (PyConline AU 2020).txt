Are you from a non-tech industry but want to learn web development? Have you tried doing the official Django tutorial and had no idea what was going on?

This talk is a story about how I learnt Django and Python coming from a non-tech industry, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will cover tips for beginners on how best to get started with Django and Python.

I will be sharing about mistakes that I made, resources that I found useful, and how I created connections both online and offline.

hi

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,320
everyone thanks for attending virtually

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,920
to this presentation

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
it's my first time attending and

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
presenting at djangocon i'm really

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
excited to be here and i'm grateful for

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
this opportunity

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,320
before i start i would like to ask a

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,840
couple of questions

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
are you watching this presentation

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
because you just started learning django

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,840
have you tried the official django pulse

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,000
tutorial and had no idea what was going

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,000
on

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
to introduce myself my name is andrew

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
kim and i'm not

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
a professional web developer i actually

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,360
work in the building and construction

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,200
industry as a project manager

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,399
today i'm going to talk about how i

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
started learning django

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,520
and my journey into the deep world of

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
web development

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
as someone not from the tech industry so

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,680
if you're just starting to learn django

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,520
i hope that this presentation will give

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,000
you some tips to help you

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,079
help you on your journey

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
this is my backstory i moved to

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
melbourne earlier this year

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
and when the pandemic hit i was made

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
redundant

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
i was unemployed for a couple of months

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
i was stuck at home

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
having a career existential crisis and i

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
was thinking

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
about all the crappy and super expensive

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
software that i was using

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
for project management i thought how

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,759
about

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,439
i build something myself and so the

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
journey began

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
i decided to build project management

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
software specifically for client-side

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
project managers

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
and architects in the building and

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
construction industry

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,119
and when i decided to learn web

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,560
development i thought you know because i

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,360
i know html and css i've made a couple

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
of wordpress

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
websites here and there that web

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439
development will be easy for me

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,720
and so i installed django and i tried

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,560
the official django poles tutorial

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
it took me four days to get through it

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,360
and in the end i still had no idea what

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,360
was going on

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
so my first advice is this the journey

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,959
to web development is long but very well

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,200
traveled

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,360
to be honest i underestimated how

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,480
complex it is to learn web development

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
maybe you know some html css maybe you

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
can make some wordpress websites

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
but back in web development is a whole

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
different level it's complex

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
it is constantly changing so don't

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
expect to learn django overnight

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,920
it's going to take you months and months

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
but the good news is that

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
this is a road that many people have

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
already taken

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
if you're feeling frustrated and

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
confused take comfort that you are not

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,080
alone

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
many people would have felt the same way

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
when they started

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,720
learning web development just takes time

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,440
and you just need to keep going

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,840
tip number two django is a good choice

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
so you decided to undertake the journey

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
and you realize there are so many

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
programming like languages and

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,440
frameworks out there

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
so so what language or framework should

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
you choose there's django

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
ruby on rails node.js and there are

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,120
front and from

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
frameworks like react angular and the

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
list goes on

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,319
when i started i spent some time

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
researching different tech stacks out

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,599
there and i

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,760
just ended up choosing django because

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,560
the tagline really resonated with me

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
the web framework for perfectionist with

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
deadline

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
and i'm glad i chose django django has

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
been a great choice

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
and it could be a great choice for you

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
too django is open source meaning it's

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
built and maintained by volunteers

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,159
so you can install it and you can

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,360
install it for free and get going

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,680
straight away

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,840
like this kind of concept of open source

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,440
is mind-blowing as someone coming from a

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,360
building and construction industry where

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
you're kind of expected to pay for any

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
kind of resources

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,879
it is a mature framework it's been tried

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,959
and tested with many many websites

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
it provides good security protection out

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
of the box

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
it has a large community this is

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,480
important because it means

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,920
django is more likely to be supported in

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,680
the future and there are a lot of

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
resources and people out there who can

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
help you

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
it's also built on python which is a

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,239
very popular language for beginners it's

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,239
clean and readable

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,759
when you're developing django it's kind

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,040
of expected that you know a little bit

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
of python

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
i personally don't think you need to be

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
an expert but i do recommend spending a

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
couple of days learning

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,919
python i did the free codecamp tutorial

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
python tutorial on youtube and i found

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
that very useful

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
so maybe you can check that out by the

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,759
way i'll be

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
putting the slides on my website with

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,280
links to all the resources

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
that i mentioned in this presentation

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,680
tip number three have a project in mind

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
you decided to learn web development and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,919
decided that django is a great choice

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
and you did some python tutorials

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
my advice is have a project in mind for

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,280
me

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
i wanted to create a project management

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,759
software for client-side project

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
managers

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,440
i was able to visualize how it should

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,680
look like and work as you can see

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
in my sketch sketch over there so

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
anything i learned going forward i was

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
thinking about

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,960
how to apply it to my project for

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
example when you create a model

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
i was thinking about oh i can have a

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,160
construction project as a model with

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,039
attributes like title address owner etc

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,639
or i should use uuid as primary keys for

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
comments

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,639
so think about the industry you work in

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,039
and think of a project which could make

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,479
your life so much easier

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,639
maybe it could also be profitable

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,000
could it be something about reporting

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,840
your organization internet

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,960
if you have a project in mind you'll be

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,840
able to apply the learnings directly

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,440
tip number four django official polls

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,479
tutorial is hard

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
try other tutorials first for people who

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,759
have just started learning django

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,479
have you tried doing the official pose

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
tutorial for me it took me four days to

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,680
get through it

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
django pulls tutorials more tailored

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
towards intermediates

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
my advice is try off with tutorials

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,039
which are actually written

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,800
for beginners there are a lot of

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
tutorials out there but here are a

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,360
couple that i tried

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,440
so mozilla's django tutorial where you

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,880
get to build a local library website

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,720
and i also bought it bought an e-book

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
called django for beginners by william

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,960
vincent this book is really good because

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
each tutorial is like a little project

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,000
you get to build very simple things like

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
blogs and message boards

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
tip number five learn the tools and

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
write down the commands

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
so you'll be spending a lot of time

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,199
writing commands in your terminal

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
i highly recommend you to write down the

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,080
commands line somewhere easily

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,560
accessible so you don't forget

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,120
in order for you to use django you need

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
to

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,720
learn how to use basic terminal commands

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,639
at least learn how to change directories

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
you will also be using keys of django

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
commands and it will become almost

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,000
second nature to you

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,039
things like python manage dot py start

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
project

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,000
run project create super user etc but

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,680
when you're starting off i suggest you

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,599
to write these down virtual environments

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
so virtual environment is like

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,720
putting all the packages you need to run

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
your project

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,960
into an environment and if you don't set

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,680
it up and activate it

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
the project will be using the packages

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
packages you've installed in your

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,160
computer

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
in a lot of tutorials they highly

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,720
recommend you to

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,520
set up a virtual environment and as a

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
beginner

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,800
it might you might find it a little bit

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
confusing

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
like it seems a little bit unnecessary

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,599
to

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,840
activate the virtual environment every

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,759
time you work on your project

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,080
and you might think that you might not

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,440
need it because

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
because you're the only one working on

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,280
the project

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
my advice is get familiar with virtual

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
environments now

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
because once you start sharing your

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,479
project with others it's going to be so

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
important

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
because virtual environments tells other

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,599
people exactly

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,599
what packages are required to run your

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
project and then they can emulate this

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,599
on their computer

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,199
and this becomes increasingly important

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,199
if you start using third-party packages

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
for me i'll probably never be able to

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
remember the command line to activate

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,440
the virtual environment

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
but i've written it down as you can see

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,800
i copy and paste it across to the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,599
terminal every time i want to activate

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,599
the virtual environment

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
following on git git is also a little

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
bit confusing

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
git is a is a version control system and

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,680
you need to learn it

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,080
in order for you to push it and pull it

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,000
from github

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
check out this website summarizing some

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
of the most important git commands

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
and when you're using git don't forget

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
to put git ignore file

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,040
as well git ignore file specifies

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,839
files and directories which shouldn't be

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,959
committed such as your installed

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,120
packages when i first started

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,200
i was experimenting with node.js modules

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
i didn't have a git ignore files and i

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,440
was committing

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,959
everything to github repository and i

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
was wondering whether really

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,680
whether it was really necessary to be

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,279
committing hundreds of megabytes to

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,880
hundreds of megabytes of modules into

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,920
the repository

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,240
turns out no and you shouldn't

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,080
so yeah check out github's git ignore

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,080
file that you can use for your django

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,120
python project and django documentation

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
django documentation is massive and can

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
be intimidating

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,839
don't you hate it when someone asks a

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
question on stack overflow

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,680
and people respond with ah just read the

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
django docs

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,200
lot of the time these kind of these

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
answers are a little bit unhelpful

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,680
for beginners because despite reading

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
the documentation several times it's

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
still

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,880
very hard to understand but sometimes

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
the answer is actually clearly spelled

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
out

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,480
in django documentation my advice

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,600
is figure out which pages in the

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,519
documentation is actually useful

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
and i suggest you to check out a blog

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
post by matsugal

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
who has written about how to read django

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
docs

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
learn these tools write down the command

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,000
lines in your notes and learn how to

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
search for answers in the documentation

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
tip number six use a linter and a

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,240
formatter

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
i wish someone told me this earlier but

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
did you know there is an automated way

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,040
to format your code

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,079
and check for style and programming

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
errors before i was formatting html

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
codes manually

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
tabs here and there and then i

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
discovered you can automatically do this

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,600
you can install packages on your text

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,320
editor to style automatically and check

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
for formatting errors for html css

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,480
js python codes and also you can

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,440
also set editor config file to say

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,839
for html files put two spaces as indent

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
and for python files put four spaces as

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
indent

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,920
i i was manually setting spaces

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
preferences for each files for like

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,079
three months until i discovered you can

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,800
automatically do this so

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
if you are manually formatting your code

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,519
stop right now

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,480
and look for solutions it's going to

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,240
make your life so much easier

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
i use sublime text so if you're using

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
that check these links out

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
tip number seven connect with web

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
developers

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,399
i studied architecture engineering and i

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,959
work in the building and construction

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,120
industry

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
so i don't really have any web developer

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,519
friends

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,800
maybe this is the same for you too

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
so how do you connect with web

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
developers i would start by asking your

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,279
friends if they know of anyone who's a

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
web developer

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
my high school friend recently

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
introduced me to her boyfriend who's a

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
web developer and now i chat to him

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,000
about web development

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,279
when i was traveling in chile i also met

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,480
a guy from reddit

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,839
he posted a website that he made and it

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
was a website about the

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
town he was living in i i happened to

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,480
come across this article and i was

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,279
planning to visit that town anyway so i

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
messaged him

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,720
saying i really like your website it's

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,920
really helpful

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
i'll be traveling there in a couple of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
days do you want to meet up and we did

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
and we kept in contact ever since and

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,160
now i also chat to him about web

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,519
development

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
i believe that people are more than

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,120
willing to help you if you ask the right

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
questions and one advice

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
obviously they're not going to do the

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,079
work for you but

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
people are willing to help whenever they

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
can

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
so if you personally don't know of any

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,160
web developers ask your friends if they

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,240
know of anyone

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,880
and connect with people online maybe at

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,880
this conference

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,399
tip number eight you can either choose

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,720
to spend time or money

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,880
now this really depends on your goal for

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
me i work full time and i'm a little bit

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
time poor

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
my my aim wasn't to become a master in

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
django but to know enough django to get

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,959
started

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
at one stage i was really stuck on

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,160
things like related names and context

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
data

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
and i worked on them for a few days i

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,920
still didn't get it

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,760
so i just decided to go on upwork.com

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
and pay someone to fix my problem and

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,600
for

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,360
me that was the best decision ever now i

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
have a couple of developers that i paid

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
to help me

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,760
my workflow goes something like this so

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,079
i try

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,320
code something and if it doesn't work i

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,000
give it to the developer

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
and then they fix it and then i review

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,360
the code and see how they did it

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,920
so check out upwork.com if you're

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,399
looking for freelancers

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
it might take a couple of tries to find

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,959
a developer

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,560
who meets your working style in your

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,800
budget

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,440
so how i approach this was i gave i

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,279
first gave them a task for a fixed price

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
and if they did a great job they

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,160
provided good service

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,959
and i got along with well with them

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,720
i hired them on an hourly basis with

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,360
capped hours and i sent them a list of

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,399
tasks each week

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
also when you're working with

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,880
freelancers make sure to manage and set

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,480
realistic expectations

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
so if it's the first time working with

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,399
them don't promise them that you'll be

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
giving a lot of work in the future

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,240
because things might change and also

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,320
give them enough time to actually work

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,639
on the code

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
so the choice is yours you can either

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,839
choose to spend time or money

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
tip number nine keep learning there are

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
so many great resources out there to

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,399
help you learn more about web

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,519
development and django

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,880
twitter twitter is not a thing in the

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
australian building and construction

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,760
industry

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
but when i was checking out a lot of web

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
development websites everyone's a

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
i found out that everyone's active on

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,199
twitter so i also got twitter

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,959
and since then i've been following many

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,680
people and organizations in the web

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
development space

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,639
i also bought three scoops of django

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,440
it's a very good book

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
it's aimed more towards experienced

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
beginners to advance people

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,800
it talks about best practices and the

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,880
reasons why and i highly recommend it

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
i've also been listening to djangochat

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
podcast

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
they discuss a whole range of things

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
from specific topics like urls

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
they also interview people who

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,199
contributes to the django framework

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,839
and people who uses django

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
professionally

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,240
there are a few blogs that i've found

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,040
i've found to be good and i follow

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,639
so matt lehman simply is better than

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,240
complex.com

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,519
mat cigar and i'm sure you know this

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,959
already as you're listening to this

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,880
presentation but

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
there are djangocons all around the

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
world and they're great talks on youtube

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,600
and so yeah highly recommend you to

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,600
check out youtube

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
last but not least my final tip number

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,199
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,399
keep it simple if it's your first time

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,160
building a web app

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,800
i would recommend just stick to django

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,399
in css framework like bootstrap obama

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
you might read things on twitter like

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,160
react view angular next

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,639
dot js nux js

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,959
honestly you'll most likely be able to

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,320
just use django and html in a css

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,720
framework to create

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,399
a project you have in mind so instead of

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
being swayed by all these new and

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,360
shiny things you read about just focus

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
on your product

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,320
so this is where i am on my journey i've

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,680
been working very hard

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
on my app called constant

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,040
i paid a couple of developers to help me

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,079
throughout the process i

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,079
started in april and now it's september

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,920
and i think i'll be able to launch for

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,399
beta testing next month

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,360
i've used django bomber css and a lot of

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,360
third-party packages

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,079
for my personal website i switched from

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,760
wordpress to wagtail cms

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
which is a django content management

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,880
system

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,600
it's a multi-site so it hosts hosts both

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,319
my personal website dear android kim.com

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,240
and also buildingproductivity.tech which

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,559
is where it's which is a blog where i

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,280
write about actionable productivity tips

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,919
for building and construction industry

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
yeah um

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
using wagtail cms and actually deploying

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
it it's been a great experience

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,880
seeing it right from the beginning to

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
the end because i could see the whole

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
process

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
so in summary the journey to web

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,200
development is long but very well

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,919
traveled

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,200
django is a good choice have a project

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,400
in mind

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,400
try easier tutorials learn the tools and

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,440
make notes

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,840
use a linting and formatting tool

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,400
connect with web developers you can

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,480
choose to spend either time or money

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,480
keep learning and keep it simple

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
if you're from a different industry and

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,559
want to take on the web development

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
journey

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,840
i highly recommend it although it will

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
be

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
frustrating at first you learn so much

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,520
about the web you'll

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
you'll encounter higher highly

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,600
knowledgeable people and engage in

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,200

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
and you'll have the skill to potentially

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
create a profitable software for your

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,880
industry

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:43,679
