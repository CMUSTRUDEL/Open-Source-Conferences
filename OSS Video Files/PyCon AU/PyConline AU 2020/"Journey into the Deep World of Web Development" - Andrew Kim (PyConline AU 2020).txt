Are you from a non-tech industry but want to learn web development? Have you tried doing the official Django tutorial and had no idea what was going on?

This talk is a story about how I learnt Django and Python coming from a non-tech industry, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will cover tips for beginners on how best to get started with Django and Python.

I will be sharing about mistakes that I made, resources that I found useful, and how I created connections both online and offline.
