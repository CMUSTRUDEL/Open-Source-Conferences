This talk is for anyone who feels alone, sitting in front of a monitor, with a mask hung on the door to the outside. Technology can't solve all our problems, and we shouldn't try, but the collective action of aligned communities can change the world. What has the Python community done, and what can we work on doing next? Where should we spend our resources, and how should we agree on priorities? What is investing in our present and what is for our future?
