Title: "Opening Keynote: MirrorWorld" - Heidi Waterhouse (PyConline AU 2020)
Publication date: 2020-09-08
Playlist: PyConline AU 2020
Description: 
	Heidi Waterhouse

https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/WAY9J7

This talk is for anyone who feels alone, sitting in front of a monitor, with a mask hung on the door to the outside. Technology can't solve all our problems, and we shouldn't try, but the collective action of aligned communities can change the world. What has the Python community done, and what can we work on doing next? Where should we spend our resources, and how should we agree on priorities? What is investing in our present and what is for our future?

this event and python more broadly is an

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
amazing source of company and community

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,880
the community is why many of us keep

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
coming back but our first keynote

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,599
speaker heidi waterhouse oh yeah this is

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
a segue

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
wants us to ask ourselves how we can

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
take advantage of that what have we done

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
what can we do next and who are we going

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,720
to be this year

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
i've been looking forward to hearing

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
this talk since i first saw the abstract

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,840
so please join me as we welcome heidi to

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,840
the virtual stage with mirror world

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,079
hello pycon eu friends it's so good to

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,239
see you this morning and i hope that you

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
have a great conference

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,160
to get started i want to talk to you

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
about how we are

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,200
living in mirror world but before that i

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,199
want to tell you that this talk has some

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
topics that may be disturbing for people

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
so take it easy and take care of

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
yourself

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,680
i'm going to address subjects like brush

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,039
fires

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,400
violence covet 19 and general

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,799
2020-ness for lack of a better way to

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,760
phrase it

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
we are through a mirror the world that

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
we have now

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,240
is not the world that we expected i

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
expected to be

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,520
in adelaide with all of you giving this

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
talk

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,040
except it would have been a different

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
talk it's a different thing on the other

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,080
side of the mirror

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,320
the other side of the looking glass

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
we've fallen through this looking glass

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,040
and we need a map

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
to teach us how to be in this place

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
lewis carroll's through the looking

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
glass is slightly less well-known than

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,040
alice in wonderland

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
but it's more relevant to us to what we

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
are experiencing

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,640
right now we're in a strange place

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,759
with strange rules that we didn't

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
understand

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,360
when we got here and are only beginning

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,040
to think we understand

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,759
now we have to run as fast as we can

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,560
just to stay in place if we don't keep

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,360
moving

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
the landscape leaves us behind and we

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,560
are lost

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,319
and alone and confused we have

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,959
our own jabberwock covet 19

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,879
twas brillig in the slithy toves did

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
gyron gimble in the wave

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
all mimsy were the bora groves and the

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
moam wraths out

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,720
grabe beware the jabberwock my son

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,720
the jaws that bite the claws that catch

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,879
beware the jubeju bird and

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
shun the frumious bandersnatch

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,519
we have to practice the impossible to be

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,400
pro-social by being as anti-social as we

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,720
can

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
to love people by not touching them and

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,440
being nowhere near them

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,160
every morning we get up and check if we

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,760
should be wearing masks for viruses

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,640
or wildfires or tear gas

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
if that's not impossible things before

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
breakfast

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
i don't know what is

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,879
these mirror experiences these

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,760
strangenesses are driven by things

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,560
in the real world just as alice

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
experienced

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
rose thorns that were actually the claws

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,920
of the kitten on her lap

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,040
we are experiencing racism inhumanity

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
and fear

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
through the mirror affecting us in ways

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,400
that we never anticipated

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,599
the drivers are real the sensation seems

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
strange

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,840
but we figure eventually

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,599
we're going to understand what's going

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,680
on

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,159
you can't give nerds a talk about

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,440
mirrors without saying something about

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,560
the original star trek mirror mirror

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,000
episode the simplistic reading of this

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
episode is that everyone

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,640
is nasty and brutish when they are not

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
tamed by civilization

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,360
but the more interesting take for right

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,319
now is that we are all responding to our

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,159
environment

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,360
to our fear to what is incentivized

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,280
the twist is not that spock has a beard

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
but that earth is an empire not a

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
federation

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
and that difference drives everything in

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,319
the show

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,440
when we think of ourselves as an empire

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,000
we do terrible things to each other when

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,720
we think of ourselves as a federation

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,160
incorporating many different worlds and

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
experiences

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,560
even if they seem alien to us then we

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
can be more humane and kind

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,000
even though we are in this mirror world

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,199
we have fallen through the looking glass

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,240
we must be aware that we are dreaming

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,240
and keep track of what matters to us

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,240
we must wake up eventually and we will

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
that doesn't mean that what's happening

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,880
right now is unreal

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,800
or meaningless but it does mean

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,840
that the futility and the difficulty of

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
our dreams

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,759
is not the only thing that's true

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,639
robert frost wrote a poem for our times

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,280
a long time ago

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
some say the world will end in fire some

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
say an ice

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,440
from what i've tasted of desire i hold

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
with those who favor fire

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
but if it had to perish twice i think i

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,479
know enough of hate to say that for

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,039
destruction ice

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,039
is also great and would suffice

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,680
i feel like we are being told that these

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,280
are our only options to end in fire

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,400
or to end in ice to to burn

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,160
with those that are burning with the

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,120
desire for things

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
or to shut ourselves off from the world

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
and

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,639
isolate ourselves and become

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,639
caged in safety

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
the world is literally burning we can

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,520
see

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,199
the smoke from space we know that

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
irreplaceable ecosystems or cinders

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,440
we can see that our cities have

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,160
combusted not spontaneously

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
but with the justifiable anger of people

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
who have run

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
out of polite ways to request that they

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,919
be treated as humans these pictures

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,759
are the third precinct in minneapolis

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,479
burned by angry protesters and

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,680
australia's bushfires this year and

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
california's

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,039
wildfires right now the world is

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,600
literally burning

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,720
and sometimes that makes it really hard

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
to care

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
about software or even about

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,639
volunteering

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
or even about doing things for each

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,520
other because

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
it makes us so scared

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
it feels like we are running to stay in

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
place that

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,599
all of our energy is going to not losing

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,199
ground like we should get an award for

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
rolling out of bed in the morning and

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
facing whatever horrible thing the day

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
is bringing us

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,479
it feels like we have nothing to pay

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,800
toward advancement

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,680
or for each other we're running

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
homeschools

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
we are all hating grocery shopping

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,400
online we are all lying awake at night

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,680
worrying about the future

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,440
it feels like we have nothing else left

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
alice said to the red queen who's

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,319
hauling her along by the hand

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
well in our country you generally get

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,280
somewhere else

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
if you run very fast for a long time as

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,440
we've been doing

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
and the red queen says to her a slow

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
sort of country

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
now here you see it takes all the

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
running you can do to keep in the same

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
place

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,800
if you want to get somewhere else you

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
must run at least twice as fast as that

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,039
i was fascinated when i found out that

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
there's actually

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
a socioeconomic theory called the red

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
queen's waist

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
or race schneiberg's political

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
capitalism

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
is also known as the treadmill of

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,039
production and it's a model of conflict

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
as well as cooperation between three

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,440
abstracted groups

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,319
the state capital especially exclusive

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,360
monopoly capital with larger fixed costs

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,800
and organized labor the desire for

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,879
economic expansion

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,199
was found to be a common political

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,240
ground for all three of these groups

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,280
everybody wants the economy to be doing

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,319
well

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,000
everybody wants to get more

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,719
this allows them to surmount their

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
separate interests and postpone conflict

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,120
by agreeing on something

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
therefore there's this grounds for

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,800
political alliance that says

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
a rising tide lifts all boats however

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
the acceleration of this treadmill the

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,720
desire for more and more

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,800
actually degrades both the

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
ability of these groups to hold each

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,320
other in check and

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,440
the ecology the climate that we live in

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,200
the acceleration was not merely a

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,480
formal a lot an informal alliance

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,320
it is a necessary thing that all these

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
parties contribute to

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,800
and the environmental damage caused by

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
all of this capitalist expansion causes

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
a decline

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,959
in value for everyone and value isn't

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,560
just money

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
value is how you're living and what

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
you're living like this is a really

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
interesting book

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,560
i didn't read the whole thing i promise

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
i just skimmed it

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
but i thought it was really interesting

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
that he talked about the red

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,200
queen's race that we have to keep

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
running

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
just to stay in place to keep up with

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
the joneses to maintain our status of

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
living

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,240
to do all the things that we expect and

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
a little bit more

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
i've been talking to you for 10 minutes

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,720
and i haven't said the word python

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,279
what does all of this mean for

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
pythonistas

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
it means that we need to remember we're

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
not separate

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
the way i remember to spell separate

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
correctly

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,360
separate it's about partition it's about

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,320
taking things apart

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,519
it's about being isolated and there's

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
this resonance

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,640
of the partition of india where i think

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,839
about

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,120
how uprooting and violent it was to have

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,760
a country

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
divided and have people trying to cross

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,360
the border

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,959
frantically to end up in the right place

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,079
a partition

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,640
is a way to keep things apart but we're

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
not

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
apart we're not separated it feels like

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,519
it i know it does

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
i am missing so many aussie hugs that i

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,440
have literally cried about it

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,160
but also here i am and here you are

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,120
we're here together in this this

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,680
numinous space of onlineness

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
we are no more separate than we choose

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,240
to be

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,240
in our meeting of the minds

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,959
i wonder sometimes if doing software

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
does anything to change the world to

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,120
make it better

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,279
and i have this to say of all of the

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,320
technology communities that i deal with

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,240
and it's a lot i talk to a bunch

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,640
thousands and thousands of technical

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
people every year

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,040
python is the community that i think is

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,680
the most solidly identified

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
as a community and as a community that's

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,040
interested

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,200
in doing good work for each other and

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,959
for the next people after you

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,720
your focus on making statistics

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,959
accessible is so vital

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
so shout out to the pi data and the

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,240
jupiter folks

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,760
and shout out to the community that

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
always feels like they're holding their

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
hands open for the next generation to

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
come along

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,839
to send the elevator back down for the

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
people who are waiting at the bottom

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
i've been to python conferences in

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
portland oregon

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
and the dominican republic in petaluma

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,480
california

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,320
and in melbourne and i've been to dozens

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
of other conferences that have python

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,560
people at them

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,839
and python people are consistently

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,880
doing the tedious repetitive and

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,360
vital work of inclusion

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,600
these pictures are just some that i've

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,959
taken at different conferences

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,760
that say python is making a real effort

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,040
as a community to reach out and make the

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,880
world better

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,639
i'm friends with thursday bram you may

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,160
remember her she's spoken at pycon

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,760
australia before

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,519
uh she wrote and helped edit

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,920
the responsible communication style

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,680
guide which is a lovely resource on how

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,320
to talk respectfully

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
about your fellow humans and now they

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
have

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,399
a supplement for age and for python

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
and one of the things that thursday

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,760
talks about

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,079
in the python supplement is that python

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,800
is language has a lot of in-jokes

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,480
and they're very funny but we also need

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
to be careful and remember to be

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
inclusive of people who have not

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
actually watched monty python

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
when we're naming all of our variables

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,519
in all of our

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,000
projects i think this is

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
like not only something we need to

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,320
remember but i think it's great that

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
it's something

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,639
we're talking about as a community it's

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
something that would get dismissed out

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,120
of hand in other communities

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,120
because well if they don't if they don't

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
like the joke they don't need to be here

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
but python as a community cares that

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,839
people

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
feel included and like they get to be

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,160
here

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
i'm sure there are times in the world

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
that we've needed open access to

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
to statistics more but i can't think of

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
them

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,440
it is really important to me that i be

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
able to tell

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
what the transmission numbers in my

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
community are and

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
it's really useful for me to know that

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
i'm getting them

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,920
in a way that i can mix and match them

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
so that i can understand exactly what's

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
going on

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
forward motion on making everything as

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,160
accessible and usable

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
as possible is not just convenience it's

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,480
politics

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,279
and python is doing a great job at that

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
we care about making sure that things

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,519
are open except

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,839
and accessible and i think that's really

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,880
meaningful

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,839
it matters it matters to give people

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
access to data

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,560
and teach them how to read it it matters

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
that you never worn a new programmer off

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,639
starting in python because of the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
community

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,760
and i've heard that happen with other

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
language communities

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
it matters that there's a foundation to

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
help start new conferences

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,880
it matters that python community

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,920
organizers are so

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,079
often not the most privileged people

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,279
it matters that pythonistas can be found

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,360
all over the world

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,199
talking about important tech adjacent

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,920
problems like contempt culture

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
or data center eco-activism or inclusive

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,160
language

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,519
not just about python but about the

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
world that python

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
is living in and being part of

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,160
i know that each of these things feels

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,680
like an enormous amount of work

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,639
with an uncertain payoff but arthur ashe

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,880
reminds us to

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,639
start where you are use what you have

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,519
do what you can we need

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
the mirror world we can't dismiss it we

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
can't go

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
without it the mirror world is essential

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
even though everything feels hard and

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
backward

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
if you've ever tried to do mirror

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,720
writing you remember how

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:43,360
how clumsy it felt to try and do it

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,199
i had surgery a few years ago that

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
disrupted a bunch of my skin and nerve

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,720
endings

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,720
part of the therapy to remap the nerves

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,800
was to look into a mirror and touch the

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
relocated skin

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
it sounds kind of ridiculous and

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,240
mystical but there's actually a lot of

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
neuroscience around it this is also a

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,000
treatment we use for people who are

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,079
having pain after amputation

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
or are trying to rehabilitate after a

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,000
stroke

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
our brains believe things that they can

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
see

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
in a path that is outside of logic or

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,120
cognition

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,399
i had to see things in a mirror to

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
convince my brain

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,720
and my body that they could coordinate

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,360
that they could remap the nerves

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,959
that these things could be put in from

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
one place to another

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,680
that we could plug them together again

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,279
it's kind of amazing

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,199
and it's not the only thing we need

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
mirrors for

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,800
we have mirror neurons that exist to

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,199
make us better at being social animals

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,759
if i yawn you will feel an urge to yawn

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,440
even reading the word yawn makes you

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,279
kind of want to yawn

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
if you hear a laugh track you'll be more

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,600
inclined to laugh along

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,880
mimicking the behavior of other animals

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
around us makes us

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,240
safer and more secure as the part of the

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
group

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,079
it's both reassuring and very dangerous

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,959
what if what we're laughing at is not

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,079
something

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,640
funny what if we are

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,839
tacitly agreeing with something harmful

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
i always found this

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,600
fascinating because there's you know

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
a genre of things that we laugh at that

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,240
may not

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
be funny um we used to call it like

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
america's funniest home videos or

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,679
blooper reels

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,439
things where people fall off their

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,320
skateboards or

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,400
whatever and get hurt and we tend to

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,440
laugh at it but

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,120
we misparsed that as laughing because

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
something was funny we also

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,880
sometimes laugh because we're

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,200
uncomfortable because we've projected

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,039
ourselves into that situation

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,600
and we don't know what we would do in

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,600
that situation and we're sort of

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,080
emotionally scared and so we

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
have have flattened out this concept of

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,960
laughing to assume that it's always

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,880
about something funny

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
but no uncomfortable laughing is an

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,840
important part of understanding

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
what laughter is and how it works so i

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,039
think it's really

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,799
interesting to think about how we are

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,799
mirroring each other whether

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
we're laughing at funny things or

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
unfunny painful things

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
whether we're yawning because other

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
people are yawning or because

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,880
we are in fact tired and stuck in a

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,880
stuffy room

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,280
we tend to mimic the people around us

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,919
but how should we honor that

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,480
impulse while being aware that it can

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,280
lead to horrific behavior

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
we need to hold this mirror of standards

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,160
and

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,440
expectations up for ourselves and for

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
our community

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,480
and name things in the boldest and most

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,360
uncompromising terms possible

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
my community which i am part of is

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
detaining

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
and separating immigrant families my

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,880
community

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,880
which i am part of is reducing access

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120
for the poor

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
we may not agree with these activities

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
but we are part of that community and it

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,120
is a thing that is happening

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
we have to hold that mirror up to

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,600
ourselves

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,559
and our communities and it's horrible

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,160
i'm an american and it is horrible to

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
know that my postal service is being

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,520
dismantled

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,440
that i may not be able to send my kids

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,320
to school in person this year

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,280
and that police officers can kill people

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,840
without consequences

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,720
norman rockwell is a famous american

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
painter

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,200
and he did these two paintings and the

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
one that i was thinking of

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
was this image of the girl holding her

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,320
prom dress up

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,960
and imagining herself as a more adult

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,799
more feminine woman she looks really

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,039
skeptical about it i don't know if this

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,520
is what she actually wants to do

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,200
maybe she does maybe she doesn't but it

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,480
is a future vision

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,240
of herself the painting

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,240
on the other side is one that i hadn't

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,200
seen before i started doing research for

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,880
this talk

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,320
and it portrays the killing

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
of freedom riders in the south these men

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,480
had gone

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,919
to help other people vote and then

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,280
they were attacked and shot and killed

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,320
and in this moment

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,000
that man is holding his friend

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
in the same way the girl is holding the

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,760
dress

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,880
this is a mirror these are both mirrors

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,640
we are looking at ourselves

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,200
and if we can't see all of the ugly

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,799
things

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,320
about our society if we if we cover the

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,880
mirrors of our mind

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,640
then we can't fix them we can't do

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
anything about a problem that we don't

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
see

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,600
the mirror is dark and i want to look

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,320
away

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,360
looking at the world right now is so

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,159
overwhelming

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,600
and i want to look away i want to play

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
trivial games

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,840
i want to do anything

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,080
other than stare into this and in truth

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,440
nobody can stare at it all the time

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,960
or will get lost in it it's dark

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,039
and i want to look away but

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,520
if i stop doing the work of looking in

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,400
the mirror it's easy to miss the things

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,280
that need to be changed and can change

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,559
i need to preserve myself i look away

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,679
sometimes

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,200
but i can't cover the mirrors and deny

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,799
reality i need to be aware of it

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,120
i need to know what's going on in the

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,120
world

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
so now that i've really depressed you at

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
the start of this wonderful conference

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,840
which is going to be amazing by the way

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,200
i'm really excited for all of the

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,720
presentations what is the takeaway what

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
is the call to action

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
this whole delicious conference is ahead

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,600
of us and i'm looking forward to the

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
community and the talks and the ways

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,760
that we can bounce off each other and

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,960
see each other

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,840
we have to remember in this conference

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
in this year that we cannot stand still

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
not technologically

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,760
not emotionally not politically the

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,679
world will keep moving

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,039
feeling like our lives are on pause

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,760
because of quasa

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,039
is an illusion things keep happening

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,720
even if we're not outside to see them

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,880
we have to practice regular

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
self-analysis we have to examine

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
ourselves

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,320
and not assume that we are okay because

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,600
we're doing what was enough

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,240
in the before times we have to keep

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,039
learning and

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,320
iterating sometimes things were not the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,080
worst problem before

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,400
but we've solved the worst problem and

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
now it's time for these other problems

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
so first before you do anything else

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,039
before you take action

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
look at yourself are you listening to

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
the quiet voices

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,280
that means both that inner voice that

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
tells you what matters to you

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,200
and the voices that are sort of

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,559
suppressed and quieted

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
by the way we consume media are you

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,440
working

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
to improve are you working to improve

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,919
yourself

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,600
are you working to improve conditions

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,120
for others i'm not

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,799
asking for heroics i'm asking you

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,840
to do something every day to make things

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,600
a little better

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,919
because that's how we're at least going

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,159
to hold ground

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,679
are you walking past something you can

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,360
fix

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
that's a really hard question because we

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,960
can only fix so many things each of us

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,679
only has finite time but

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,360
our standard is what it is we're willing

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,919
to walk past

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,600
and we need to really consider what

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,360
we're walking past and if it's something

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,440
that we can fix

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,320
maybe it's not even something we can fix

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,520
or solve permanently but we can address

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,640
maybe we need to buy a sandwich for the

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
guy on the corner

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,760
maybe we need to take a deep breath

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
and write to the teacher about how our

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,200
kid is having trouble

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,120
maybe we need to eject a community

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,840
member who's behaving badly

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,320
and diminishing the experience for

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,720
everybody

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,480
whatever it is that we need to do we

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
need to find the courage to not walk

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
past it

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,480
next look around yourself

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,760
are you contributing to your communities

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
and contribution doesn't necessarily

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
mean code and it doesn't necessarily

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
mean

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,960
emotional labor and it doesn't

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
necessarily mean technical writing

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
although of course that's awesome you

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,600
knew i'd say that

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,760
contribution sometimes just means

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,679
going through and filing things or

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,799
sorting or making it easier for the next

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,200
person to do a little bit of work

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,000
are you taking reasonable chances and

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,159
this is

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,400
a balance in both directions are you

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,159
taking chances that are reasonable

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,039
based on the amount of risk they will

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,520
cost you and are you taking chances

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,120
that are reasonable based on what they

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,600
don't cost you that are

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,039
that are accessible are you taking care

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,760
of yourself are you not over betting

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,840
and when you're looking around you are

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,720
you making it about you

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
because i've asked you to do the inside

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
work

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
of looking at yourself but when you're

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
doing the outside work

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
maybe we need to be careful not to make

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,919
it about ourselves maybe we need to make

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,440
it about

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,440
what other people in the world need

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
heal by observing and mirroring each

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,520
other

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,960
touch real things this is both

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,320
a an injunction for more crafting and

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
a meaningful thing that says we need to

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,159
acknowledge

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,200
that all of our work on computers

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,039
can feel very intangible to us

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,799
maybe we need to take some time to touch

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,960
real things

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,919
we need to look out for each other

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,279
because

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,279
nobody's coming to save us but us so

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,600
in the moment we need to help each other

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,720
out even if it's a little boost or a

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,159
little nudge the most that we can afford

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,200
and draw your circle wide there's a

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,520
spiritual

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,039
that i was thinking of when i wrote this

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,440
how wide is your circle

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,440
the bigger the circle of people that you

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,720
think of as your family

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,919
as your community as humans the more

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,039
likely it is

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,799
that you're going to come up with

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,799
something just and equitable for

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,520
everyone

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,520
i love this phrase and i looked up as

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,279
much as i could about it and

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
probably it's completely apocryphal and

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,320
has nothing to do with anything

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
but it says before enlightenment chop

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,559
wood

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:44,159
and carry water after enlightenment

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,240
chop wood and carry water i'm not

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
asking you to change everything about

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,360
what you're doing

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
we still have to chop wood we still have

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,400
to carry water

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,799
we still have to make our kids attend

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,720
school no matter what it looks like

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
we still have to send emails that are

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
both awkward

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and difficult we still have to take care

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,720
of our friends

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
look after our family and care about the

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
people

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,679
who are in our circle none of that

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,159
changes

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,039
but i think it does matter that we think

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,240
about how

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,440
big we can be how big python can be

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,200
how big australia can be how big the

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,480
world can be

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,520
if we are all carrying water

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,480
for each other so

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,679
if this talk was too long and you read

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,120
your email during it because

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,360
first thing in the morning and you

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
needed to get to it let me leave you

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,039
with a

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,159
quote from kurt vonnegut

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,279
hello babies welcome to earth it's hot

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,919
in the summer

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,600
and cold in the winter it's round and

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
wet and crowded

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,159
at the outside babies you've got about a

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,320
hundred years here

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
there's only one rule that i know of

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,159
babies

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,159
god damn it you've got to be kind

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
go to it pythonistas have an amazing

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:17,840
conference

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:17,840
and remember to be kind to each other

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,679
thanks so much for that heidi um how are

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,279
you doing

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,840
i'm okay it's it's not an easy time but

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,679
i'm in a lucky place so i really

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,000
appreciate that

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,039
yeah so um one of the questions that we

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,399
had from the audience

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:40,080
uh is how can people get involved

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:43,120
in helping outside the python community

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,279
that's a great question so i'm in

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,120
america and of course my resources are

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,320
sort of american-centric

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
but in general if you are in a low-risk

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
group

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
see if you can volunteer for food

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,039
shelves if you can't afford to

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
if you can't afford the exposure of

00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,919
volunteering see if you can afford some

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,600
money

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,360
because there are people who are going

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,039
hungry because they can't work

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,159
and like that's just fundamental we need

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,720
to feed people

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,000
we have to feed people so i would start

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,880
with food shelves and

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,360
i would start with mutual support in the

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,760
u.s

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,919
we have something called neighborhood

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,640
emergency response teams

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,520
and they help communities build

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
resilience

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,679
and prepare for emergencies not just

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
like the emergencies we're having now

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,320
but

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,919
earthquake response and fire response

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,600
and all sorts of things like that

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
and it's a it's a way to meet your

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,360
neighbors and

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,880
connect with your community and i would

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,279
hope that there is something like that

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,919
in everybody's community so that you can

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
get a little

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
basic training and get to know each

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,039
other so

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
when we're thinking about what we can do

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,440
to respond

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,799
a lot of it can but doesn't necessarily

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
mean stepping out from behind our

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,880
computers

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,640
i mentioned thursday bram earlier uh

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,120
she's not going to the protest in

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,840
portland but she's organizing

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,360
uh bail assistance and she's helping

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,559
collate a whole bunch of links and

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,640
resources

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,080
and that is using her organizational

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
powers

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,120
to to leverage a lot of other volunteers

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,159
so i'm not saying you have to be

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
out there and able to do 100 work i'm

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,799
saying

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,120
look around at what you have and what

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,039
you're good at and contribute a little

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,080
bit of it

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,679
cool thanks so um related to that um

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,600
i've got one question which i can sort

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,720
of relate to as well um

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,440
as someone who gets overwhelmed easily

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,880
what's the best way to not completely

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,320
shut down like what's the best way to

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
sort of keep looking into the mirror

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,360
um and part of me and maintain the

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
level of self-preservation that you need

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,760
to

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,000
be able to do that uh

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,520
i i will not lie i sometimes use

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
chemical assistance for this

00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,559
um talk to your doctor um

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,320
that said i think one of the things

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,360
that's sort of our downfall

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,200
as technologists is we've been trained

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,720
to look at the big picture and the

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
architecture and the infrastructure and

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
all of the causes and to understand the

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,039
whole problem before we code anything

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,760
and that's not actually useful

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,760
for us to deal with an emergency what's

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
useful for us to deal in emergency

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,120
is to basically write unit tests of

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,320
action

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,240
can i sustain my household for a day do

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,600
we have enough water do we have diapers

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,600
and medication and stuff

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,960
saved for a day if i had to pick up a

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,919
bag and go would i be okay for a day

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,600
how about a week can my unit test extend

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
to a week

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,360
and if you write these small things it's

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,080
not like i need to change how government

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,919
works

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,279
it's like in the us we have a thing

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,440
called resist bot

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,880
which helps us remember to text our our

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
representatives

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,120
um something like that where you're like

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,760
okay every day i'm going to write

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,919
one postcard i'm going to do one

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,200
affirmative action because

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,840
none of us can solve it all but all of

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,519
us

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,200
can solve a part of it and if i think

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,399
about the big picture if i think about

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
like a creeping

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,200
fascism all over the world i freak out a

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,360
lot and i just sort of like

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,320
unplug and go hide under a weighted

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,799
blanket and

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,799
uh play stardu valley a lot which is you

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,120
know a valid coping technique

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,559
but also isn't making me feel better in

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,440
the long run because i haven't changed

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,000
anything

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,840
i mean besides growing some really great

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,960
like fruit trees

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,320
so i try and make i try and understand

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,320
it less from like a continuous

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,120
integration viewpoint and more from like

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,640
a

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,640
test driven development viewpoint

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,640
thanks so um for those of you watching

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,519
if you have any more questions please do

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
pop them in the chat

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,120
um because then it was feeding me

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,159
questions

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,080
and would like more um but

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,360
while we're waiting for for the delay to

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
happen and for some more questions to

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,320
come through

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,919
to sort of um something that i've been

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,440
thinking about a lot myself and it sort

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,000
of rips off both of those first two

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,480
questions

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,039
is so i'm a uh

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,640
a white transgender woman in tech and

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,840
that sort of puts me

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,720
uh at the sort of intersection of a of

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,080
sort of

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,559
uh disadvantage and privilege and so

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,840
it's kind of a really weird place to try

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,120
and navigate with all this sort of stuff

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,399
going on do you have any sort of

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,480
thoughts on

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,919
how to navigate that intersection and

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,080
how to

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,120
um how to

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,600
navigate the bad bits and still leverage

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
the the the privileges that we still

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,320
have

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,679
for for good yeah so

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,440
i think that it's really useful first to

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,480
understand that privilege and dis

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,600
privilege

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,000
are intersectional kimberly crenshaw

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,640
wrote the definitive text on what

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,440
intersectionality means but

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,320
at its very highest level it says that

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,480
all of us

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
have cultural advantages and

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,240
disadvantages

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,240
and they interlock in ways that we may

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,440
not understand if we are not

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,240
part of that small venn diagram like for

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,839
me to be

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,720
a white woman in tech is a slight

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,760
disadvantage uh

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,839
and for me to have a neurodiversity

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,200
issue i have adhd

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,679
um it's a different advantage

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,560
disadvantage and i need to understand

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
that you know

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,000
disability sometimes applies to me and

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,520
privilege

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,720
also applies to me and how do i

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,760
under use my the the privilege that i

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,280
have

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,040
to pull other people up um

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,159
i don't find it valuable to spend a lot

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,119
of time

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,879
sort of railing against the machine um

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,560
the machine is very big and it wants to

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,400
squish me

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,359
instead i was looking at this conference

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,920
and the speakers and i think my new

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,680
metric

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,760
for like internal professional success

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,119
is there are six conference speakers

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,320
here who

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,520
i have been able to help who i've worked

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
through a talk with

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,800
or given some career advice to or helped

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,079
with a job lead

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,119
and if if i use

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,520
that as a metric like we always we

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,320
always accomplish what we measure right

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,960
if you pay programmers based on lines of

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,480
code you get extremely verbose code

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,079
uh so if we are going to accomplish

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,240
things we need to think about what

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,960
metrics that we're setting

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,240
that make our accomplishments meaningful

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,599
and worthwhile to us

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,400
so like maybe for this year my metric is

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,119
how many people can i get on stage

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
because

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,359
i feel like being able to speak and

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,480
being on stage

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,000
gives you a wide range of advantages not

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,800
just like sometimes i get to go to

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,440
australia

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
but also you're not going to freeze up

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,680
when you're giving a presentation to

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,320
30 people at your company and that's an

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
advantage

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,440
that's a privilege that you feel

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,280
comfortable

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,119
putting together a slideshow and saying

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
hey here's why we need to provision more

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,000
this year

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,200
so i want to say

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,160
that that as people who have some

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,320
privilege

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,119
we need to make sure that we are

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,920
distributing it as widely as possible

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,040
and when i say i don't want to always

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,520
rail against the machine

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,880
that's not to say that i don't want to

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,920
use my privilege

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,119
up because that is also important uh

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,359
at my company right now we're having

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,560
some serious discussions about pay

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,880
transparency

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
and we ask about pay transparency six

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
months ago and then they were like

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,520
ah coveted can't think about anything

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
which just may

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,800
may or may not be what's going on

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,240
um but since i'm in the original cadre

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,440
of people who started work at this

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,119
company i'm not going to get fired for

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,359
being an agitator that way

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,880
or i have a much longer runway than

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,079
somebody who's only been here six months

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,760
or a year

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,200
so that's what i'm going to use my

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
privilege to do is

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,920
ask questions that might be more

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,520
dangerous for somebody who's newer

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,320
and asking questions is not

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,000
nothing asking questions induces

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,760
discomfort

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,520
or at least if the questions that you're

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,839
asking are

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,599
meaningful they cause a little

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,200
discomfort

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,599
and you may have noticed that even in

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,599
your relationships like the really

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,160
meaty should we stay together kind of

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,760
questions like do you want kids do you

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,320
care about religion tabs or spaces like

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,400
we have to discuss these things and and

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,680
it's uncomfortable for us like

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,839
because we have these deeply held

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,640
beliefs so every time we're asking a

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,359
question we're

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,800
we're forcing people to justify their

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,040
worldview

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,800
and the reverse of that is every time we

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,520
ask someone with less privilege

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,200
a question we are also asking them to

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,839
justify their worldview

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,760
so every time someone says no where are

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,640
you really from

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,280
were you born a girl is that your

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,640
natural

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,280
hair color we're saying i don't believe

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,440
your worldview i'm challenging it

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,040
i think that's really an interesting way

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,720
to think about

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,720
who we want to induce discomfort in

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,280
yeah so um i've noticed that through

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,079
sort of thinking through a lot of these

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,440
things i

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,880
i see um some of the experiences that

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,920
other disadvantaged groups

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
have and go hey i can relate to that and

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,480
then

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
go but if i talk about

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,680
how do i relate to that and how do i

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,680
make sure that i'm not

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,400
talking over people do you have any sort

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,680
of advice on that sort of thing

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,119
um i think that

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,000
with every it's hard it's really hard

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,880
because

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,119
we have this desire to like i learned a

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,160
hack for this let me help you

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,640
um is not always the solution that

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,800
people want

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
so i think that one of the things we can

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,520
do when we're thinking about how not to

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,880
talk over people

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,240
is to ask if people want input

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,960
so i have this thing i i'm like the mom

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,200
friend and i end up giving everybody

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,320
relationship advice

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,480
and um that means that i frequently

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,079
they say something that i have a piece

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,320
of advice for

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,240
my first job the first thing i say is

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,480
not well you should

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,320
it is do you want advice or sympathy

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,079
and if you can separate those two

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,800
your advice giving gets so much more

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,040
valuable because people only

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,480
you only tell people who want it

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,760
sometimes you're complaining because you

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,520
just want some sympathy

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,119
the bus drove by you and splashed you

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,240
and also you dropped your

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,359
your parmy in the wastebasket

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,520
accidentally like

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,200
it's a terrible day i don't i don't need

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,800
any advice about like staying away from

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,240
buses and not dropping things

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,119
thanks um i need

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,640
i need some sympathy but if you're

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,520
having a thing where you're like

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,920
i'm really frustrated with my my manager

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,760
and

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,880
i don't know how to get around this

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,160
roadblock that he's put up

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,480
take a deep breath and say do you want

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,520
advice or sympathy

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,920
and asking that every time

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,280
positions you as a person who is like

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,119
willing to give advice

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,800
but not insistent on it as your identity

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,240
maybe what you just want is listening

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
so relative to that we've had a question

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
from the chat

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,400
about uh friends and family and

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,960
community and

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,319
how to to sort of draw the lines and

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
prioritize energies and

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,440
define boundaries and balance that

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,760
without

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,880
burning out do you have any thoughts on

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
how to best go about that

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,960
i think that

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,560
it's a very religious answer so i'm

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,480
sorry i think

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,440
that we are

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,920
given so much to handle sometimes but

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
also

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
if we look around we are mostly given

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,560
the resources to handle them

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,440
maybe not gracefully maybe not well but

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,440
if we can

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,319
get over ourselves and ask for help

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,880
i think that helps a lot so like uh

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,520
yesterday my wife was running an errand

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,440
and i was having a terrible day and i'm

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,839
like will you please pick me up

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,839
like a tall cold soft drink and she went

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,319
i don't know five miles out of her way

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,599
to pick me up a cherry limeade

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,000
and that made me feel really loved like

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,839
was it work for her yes but it was work

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,359
that she could afford

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,960
and so when somebody in your

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,520
in your course circle somebody that you

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,119
think of yourself is responsible for

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,119
asks you for help and it's not something

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,920
you can afford

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,960
it is your responsibility to say that

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,800
which is really

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,480
really hard i love you i don't want to

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,680
say no to you i

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,000
i dedicated my life to you and if you

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,720
don't

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,079
stop talking to me the minute i start to

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,599
drift off in bed

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,599
i will smother you with this pillow

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,079
same life seven hours apart um

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,760
but i think that that we all have a

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,359
personal energy budget

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,359
and we all have things that fill our

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,839
bucket and things that empty it

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,440
and we're willing to scrape a little

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,359
deeper for people we love but there

00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,319
comes a point when we have to say

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,319
my bucket is empty i cannot help you

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,960
please let's let's find another way and

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,079
this is especially difficult

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,760
for parents or people who have dependent

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,119
relatives

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,560
there's not a time that you can say

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,160
stop crying for 20 minutes baby

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,760
like the baby is not going to stop

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,400
crying

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,960
there is a time you can say if i walk in

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,920
there

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,200
when the baby is crying i will not be a

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,359
good parent

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,280
maybe the baby has to cry for 20 minutes

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,680
and i have to go sit in another room and

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,079
cry myself

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,040
if that's what it takes to be the best

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,200
parent you can be

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,560
i give you permission to do that and i

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,960
give you permission

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,920
to cry about school and i give you

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,200
permission

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,800
to sometimes skive off

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,319
like zoom calls for school because

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,119
it's so difficult and what we have to do

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,760
is

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,240
remember that we have a long ways to go

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,640
we have

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,640
months and months of this left and we

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,760
have to pace ourselves

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,440
yeah so another question that's come up

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,359
is uh the someone wants to know

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,599
how to navigate the sort of tension

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,280
between excluding someone by sort of

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,119
drawing attention to their differences

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,240
their transness or their race or their

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,000
hair colour

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,920
and between not acknowledging it all

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,960
and sort of erasing their experiences um

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,200
do you have any advice on how to

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,560
how to walk that line oh so this is a

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,920
classic problem and so

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,400
my wife is also trans and there was a

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,720
time

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,240
when i was doing this this terrible

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,240
problematic thing where i'm like

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,680
wow you really look like a girl i don't

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,839
know no

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,839
no

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,720
um it was it was a learning experience

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,319
for both of us

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,920
um i think the the thing is

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,079
it depends on what the community is here

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,200
for if the community

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,079
is here for we're gonna work on this

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,640
jupiter notebook

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,079
together then maybe it's not relevant

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,960
that you notice something different

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,920
about them

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,119
but if the community is here for this is

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,000
a working support group

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,359
because i have the focus of a squirrel

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,480
on crack

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,000
then maybe you can say hey this is my

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,440
therapist

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,119
if you're interested i know they have

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,560
openings

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,440
um or even like oh yeah my kid does that

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,640
too

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,200
like the closer you are to somebody's

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,040
difference

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,040
the easier it is to sympathize with it

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:43,760
yeah so um another question is

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,319
about speaking up to protect other

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,520
people

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,240
when to draw the line uh

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,000
or the the question is when is my own

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,640
comfort and safety more important for me

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
to protect

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,880
than theirs where do you where do you

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,800
stop speaking up

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,040
if it's at all possible i would talk to

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,680
the person you want to speak up for

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,400
so i'm a remote employee we're talking

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,040
about this whole

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,800
like location based payband thing i'm

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,000
kind of upset about it because

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,359
it could affect my salary my teammate

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,640
is not remote and he said would you like

00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,880
me to

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,280
talk about that question because it's

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,359
less personal to him and he can stand up

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,880
and say hey this payband thing seems

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,760
like a terrible idea

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,599
um without it being like me being

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,560
defensive

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,000
and so that gives the person that you're

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,599
trying to speak up for

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,520
the autonomy to say something about it

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,440
like there are people who would really

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,520
like it if you did not stand up for them

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,240
they are just really tired of the

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,440
backlash that they know they will get

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,359
uh this happens all the time online like

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,480
a prominent woman in tech will say

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,680
something

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,760
a bunch of guys will be and it's

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,599
it's guys i'm sorry it is a bunch of

00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,560
guys will be super negative about it

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,119
and then like defenders will jump into

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,720
the

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,200
the fray and try and help out

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,119
it's not helpful um especially if the

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,160
person hasn't asked for help

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,960
it just makes the dog fight keep rolling

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,800
it's like

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,920
instead of breaking up the fight which i

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,560
think is what people think they're going

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
to do

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,240
you're just adding more dogs to the pile

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,720
and it's no good

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,760
so if at all possible when you're going

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,240
to stand up and defend

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:32,000
somebody check with them first because

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,000
we aren't living their experiences

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
thanks so

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,480
sorry i'm having to take some technical

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,240
issues it's all good

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,680
bueno can i please have the questions

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,240
that i have answered down the bottom of

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,200
the screen please

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,119
so um i did want to ask um sort of some

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,760
more questions about

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,400
technology and sort of our our

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,200
communities

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,920
um someone asked very early on uh said

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,960
that the

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,440
the claim about python being one of the

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,800
most

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,280
community oriented communities is a bold

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,000
claim

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,280
and that they've noticed r and haskell

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,079
have some pretty interesting communities

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,200
as well

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,400
um what sort of can be

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,319
is there anything that you've seen in

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,000
other communities that you think python

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,359
can learn from

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,839
i think that's a great question and it

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,960
is a bold claim and i i am willing to

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,160
stand corrected

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,200
like i have not been able to immerse

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,960
myself in all

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,640
you know say 30-ish modern languages

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,720
um i think that uh

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,680
one of the things that i'm really

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,040
encouraged

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,720
um seeing from

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,640
um other other community organizations i

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,319
really love the write the docs group

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,040
like we talked about the pacman rule

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,079
earlier that's eric holster who's also

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,960
pythony but is

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,400
is right the doxie too and one of the

00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,559
things i thought was really interesting

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,319
is they explicitly said

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,760
you don't have to be a technical writer

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,119
to come to this technical writing

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,880
conference

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,200
all you need to do is care about

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,960
documentation somehow

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:14,880
and i feel like lowering the

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,440
the apparent bar is really important to

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,800
to allowing community members in i you

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,280
know

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,880
how how do i feel coming to a python

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,240
conference as a person who doesn't

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
program python is that

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,000
something that i feel like i'm going to

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,640
get content that's useful

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,520
and meaningful even if i don't i don't

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,440
know your

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:38,480
your syntax yeah and so i guess

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,160
off of that and um off of the

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,599
the sort of ideas that eric was writing

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,079
about when he wrote about the pacman

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,680
rule

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,119
and the rule that i introduced in

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,800
the video that you just watched the name

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,839
of which i've forgotten actually filmed

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,040
about a week ago

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,920
snowflake snowball yeah something snow

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,520
related that's it

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,400
um so um i guess one of the things that

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,400
i've noticed

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,400
um is that um like

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,839
we a lot of us that have been in in the

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,640
pike on a you community for years and

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,800
years we have

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,000
sort of this lovely experience of first

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,160
joining the community

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,680
and being sort of welcomed and included

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,760
and sort of brought in

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,160
and now we're sort of we're part of the

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,960
the core group we're part of the clique

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,079
um

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,400
and uh the community the

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,520
the size of the event is so much bigger

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,760
and it's been going

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,359
for uh this is the eleventh year of

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,000
pycon at u and it's

00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,599
my ninth personally and when i first

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,520
came it was the second

00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,119
how um how do you go about

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,200
uh do you have anything sort of more to

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,240
add to what what eric was saying about

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,319
making sure

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:51,440
that we don't turn into a clique

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,079
as we sort of grow and evolve

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,920
have we ever considered chaos testing

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,520
conference organizers

00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,319
i i feel chaotically tested right now

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,280
right but i feel like what if three

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,480
months out

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,800
somebody said okay you're off duty

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,240
it's gonna be fine you've trained up to

00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,559
this apprentice

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,800
or taking your computer away we'll see

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,000
you at the conference

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,040
you're terrified right and yet

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,480
and yet this is how we build robust

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,960
systems

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,079
is not just taking servers online

00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,280
offline but taking

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,250
people offline we had a pandemic that

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,800
did that for us this year

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,400
[Music]

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,440
yeah but like with any organization

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,200
what what will inevitably happen is

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,640
people start to burn out and other

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,240
people will have to step up

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,079
and the question is whether the people

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,839
who have to step up will

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,240
walk into a place that has like some

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,599
documentation and

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:56,240
has had apprenticeships and has a

00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,960
continuity plan or whether they're going

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,319
to have to reinvent the wheel

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,920
yeah and so um

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,680
i i also want to share that if you are

00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,559
new uh katie mclaughlin who is my

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,400
predecessor

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,760
has written up a nice little short

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,079
culture documentation which does

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,079
document a few of our in jokes including

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,880
the names of the rooms that you'll see

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,480
on this this side of your screen no that

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,920
side because

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,960
yeah um so

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,079
um uh what

00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,680
who has what's a good sort of tip as we

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,720
sort of move into the first break

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
of for meeting new people in this online

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,040
conference how

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,960
what would you recommend the first

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,119
timers that we have watching now

00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,040
um how would you how would you suggest

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,119
they take get the most out of this event

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,119
all right i'm so excited that you're

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,400
here because

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,599
this is the great thing that we've

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,599
discovered about putting all our

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,400
conferences online is like

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,079
twice as many people can come we're not

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,480
restricted by venue space

00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,680
we're not restricted by finance nearly

00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,440
as much

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,880
all sorts of i i was at a conference

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,640
earlier this year that had somebody

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,720
logged in from greenland

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,839
greenland i have never in all of my

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,599
years of going to like

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,119
40 conferences a year met somebody from

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,920
greenland um

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,319
because it's really expensive to fly out

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,319
so

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,599
i think one of the things to remember is

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,200
that there are a lot of new people

00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,880
around and you're not the only one who's

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,119
feeling like weird and uncomfortable and

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,079
like everybody knows everybody else

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,559
uh the other thing to remember is that

00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,960
people

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,640
want you to succeed nobody is showing up

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,920
in a community chat

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,000
to like nag you and if they are

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,200
we're gonna find them and kick them out

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,079
because that's against the code of

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,240
conduct

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,440
so what's actually happening is a whole

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,599
bunch of

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,119
sort of anxious computer people are

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,119
trying to figure out

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,400
how to talk to each other and they want

00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,040
you to succeed

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,839
so i have these these stock opening

00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
lines

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,119
that i use when i meet people did i

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,599
mention

00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,160
like 40 conferences a year when i meet

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,920
people

00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,839
uh one of them is would you like a

00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,520
sticker which works great in person but

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,280
not so much here

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,640
one of them is what's been your favorite

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,119
talk so far

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,040
what are you looking forward to what's

00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,640
an interesting problem you solved this

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,079
year

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,079
how are you doing all of these

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,119
questions instead of like telling about

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,119
ourselves

00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,200
allow other people like a minute to

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,359
think about what is

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,280
what is going on with them what what

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,319
talk was interesting and why did i think

00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,920
so

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,920
okay what talk did you think was

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,359
interesting huh

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,720
are you going to go to this other talk

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,400
that seems like it's on that related

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,119
topic

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,640
this is how it's relatively easy to get

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,760
conversation going

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,520
and it's uh when you pay someone a

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,440
compliment this is like my golden rule

00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,880
when you pay someone a compliment

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,839
compliment something that they have

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,880
chosen

00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:53,280
not something about what they are so i

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,079
i have in fact chosen my hair color i

00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
never mind

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,240
when people talk to me about my hair

00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,280
color uh i have not chosen the shape of

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,960
my body

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,319
and therefore i would rather not have

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,040
people comment on the

00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,520
shape of my body it's that difference

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,680
between

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,280
something that is expressing yourself

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,000
and something you're just

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,359
something you're just are and so if

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,559
you're looking for something

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,280
to say to a stranger um it's almost

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,440
always better

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,200
to choose to compliment them on

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,160
something

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,559
that that they have proactively chosen

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,960
cool

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,480
thank you so much for all of that advice

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,640
and thank you so much for your talk i

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,680
really enjoyed uh the bits of it that i

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,119
actually got a chance to watch while

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,119
running around organizing this morning

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,359
and i'm so looking forward to

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,240
watching another uninterrupted once this

00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,599
is all over

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,040
um so thank you again heidi i believe

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,359
jack promised you a round of applause

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,520
but

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,920
uh you're gonna have to deal with me

00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,640
if everyone else wants to clap at home

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,880
please do

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,920
we can't hear you either way i guess i

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,079
can see the

00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,520
emojis though ah yes cool the emojis i

00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,200
forgot about them i can't see them i

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,559
can't see anything so this is kind of

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,359
into a camera so uh before we go to our

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,640
first break

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,240
um we're just just on time so about 10

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,760
minutes before the next uh

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,440
block of talks start in all four of our

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,160
breakout rooms um

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,720
i do want to just give a quick plug to

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,119
the

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,559
um the on the program if you click that

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,280
sunday tab you'll have noticed

00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,359
that uh because of a lot of the running

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,880
around to finalize things for it was a

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,640
little bit last minute it was a bit

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,160
vague until recently but we do have a

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,359
fully fleshed out list

00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,799
we're not fully fleshed out but we have

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,559
a relatively fleshed out list of things

00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,760
that are happening tomorrow

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,559
um my experience at pycon has been

00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,040
that going to the sprints uh i think my

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
third

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,280
icon in the first one was in brisbane is

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,720
what changed it from

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,480
just an event into a community for me so

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,359
um i really want to emphasize that if

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,880
you want you that's

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,559
that's what that's what did it for me

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,839
and that's probably a really good idea

00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,200
to jump in and see

00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,319
um sort of get the chance to get to know

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,839
