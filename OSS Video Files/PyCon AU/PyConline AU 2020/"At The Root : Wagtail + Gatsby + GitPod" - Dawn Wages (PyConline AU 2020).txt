Exploring if a GatsbyJS progressive web app generator frontend with a headless Wagtail backend could be a solution for small-sized clients and personal projects when I want to "whip something up" quickly without sacrificing design, performance/hosting costs, user or site editor experience (Can I have it all)? Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a open source framework based on React. Wagtail (https://wagtail.io/) is a Django CMS with LOTS of cool features for content creators, and "plays nicely with everything else in your tech stack" (source: Wagtail) because its built on and easily integrates with all uses of Python. 


Why? Not only do I enjoy the new and shiny things as a consultant, both Wagtail and GatsbyJS are established frameworks and active communities that put considerable effort in providing a great product with a smooth developer experience. We enjoy the benefits of Django / Wagtail CMS, with a incredibly fast pre-fetched progressive web app with GatsbyJS. The goal is nice, fast and fun. 


I am approaching this talk by walking through how I started out with minimal experience with GatsbyJS or GraphQL, and moderate experience with React and headless Wagtail to creating and deploying (Netlify) this app. I am not an expert in either technology, but was able to quickly navigate getting started as well as identify lots of resources in both communities to build out in a more complex experience.

two rock

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
two rock software team uh dawn will not

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
be taking questions during her talk

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
but she'll be in the chat room

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,119
afterwards um in the flip-flop radar

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,199
hallway track

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,199
so uh you can catch her there after her

my second talk like this and uh it's

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,079
just a little bit easier

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,280
but it's a little weird hoping to see

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,399

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,960
uh vinulus so i will keep up there so

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
um as i've mentioned before i'm giving a

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,320
talk on gatsby jf

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,079
wagtail and git pod um don't worry if um

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
all those words or some of those words

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
are completely foreign to you this is an

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
introduction

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,600
talk um and given to a python audience

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
that does not necessarily um

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
have experience with any of these

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,080
technologies but fundamentally

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
the talk is better understood

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,880
experience with django and

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,159
web frameworks and i kind of jump in and

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,439
also don't get scary there's a little

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
bit of javascript that we're going to

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,560
have on screen as well

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,200
all right so as i mentioned my name is

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,280
dawn you can find me on twitter

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
i used to tweet too much now i tweet

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,479
almost too much

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,360
as dawn wages says um i am a wagtail

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
core team

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,479
team member i'm also a django and react

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,240
consultant

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,280
i consult independently with my company

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
rugby sheet designs but i also am a

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
consultant with an

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
excellent team uh called two rock

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
software

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
um and we are django shop i live in

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
philly

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
and i am a dog mom and a queer woman of

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,399
color

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,120
and that is my puppy he's not really a

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,800
puppy anymore he's forever a puppy

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
all right so let's get into the meat of

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,480
it um so we're going to be exploring

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
um what ragtail and gatsby can do so

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,959
this is

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,080
somewhat of a case study uh

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
as a consultant i am really looking for

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
projects and being able to deliver

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
quickly easily and with a great

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,680
developer experience

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,959
um both independently wagtail and gatsby

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,319
frameworks um strive to do that

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,239
i'm still going to give a little bit

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,760
more information on what these do but

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
gatsby is a

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
progressive web app generator so many of

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
you

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
may be familiar with static site

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
generators uh

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,959
gatsby is very much the same thing also

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
called the static on site generator

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
but a new flavor of such as it

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,400
um starts out and you

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,680
write and react in the back end it

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,239
dehydrates distills down as uh

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,080
static site generators typically do and

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
then we'll rehydrate into

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
what feels like and looks like a

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,800
progressive web app

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,159
um really really exciting so

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,560
why do all of these things um i like

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,599
new and shiny things it's really fun for

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
me i

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,480
i love being a perpetual learner um and

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,400
i already had a background in

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,879
wagtails wagtail is a django cms

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
um has all the python core all of the

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
things that django can do

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,400
and all of the ways you can creatively

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
integrate

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,599
uh python projects and python packages

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,680
uh with the jag django

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
framework you can also do with wagtail

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,120
with a lot of extra

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,640
special flavors in there wagtail

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,920
has its own models that you can import

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,000
and also its own admin that makes it

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
incredibly easy to hand over to the end

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
client

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
and have the content manager uh be able

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,159
to

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,040
drag and drop and click uh things uh

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
in an even more intuitive way than the

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
django

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
um admin out of the box will let you do

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
um

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,479
so it's it's both frameworks really

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,639
emphasize the desire to have a great

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
and streamlined experience and when i

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
want to have small

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
medium-sized clients or personal

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,759
projects and want to whip something up

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
quickly without sacrificing design or

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
performance

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
this is a stock that i would love to use

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
and i was uh

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
out to figure out if i could have it all

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,280
so future versions of this talk and more

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
information from this talk will be

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
available on

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,560
my website glittertech.dev um i also

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,360
uh will continue to be blogging for two

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
rock

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
software please look out for that um and

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
as

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,479
a special we'll all be linked in with uh

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
the wagon sales 14

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,479
updates um and things like that so

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
please keep track of

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,919
what i'm doing if you're interested in

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,960
either contributing more to the

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,919
documentation

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
there's not a lot out there um quite yet

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,639
for this

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
but i'll provide some of the resources

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,600
on the slide a little bit later on what

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,440
i use

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
and some of the pain points that i went

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,759
through

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,039
all right so like i mentioned the act

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
both

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
uh frameworks have really excellent and

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
active communities

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,560
uh gatsby is known for being really

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,039
really kind of

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,320
javascript-esque fun framework community

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,320
they give out a lot of swag

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,560
they love developer experiences both

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
have sprints on accessibility

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
specifically

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,960
uh wagtail i've i've been a part of um

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,199
updates

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,240
and and has recently had uh this past

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
january

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,280
um had a uh sprint on accessibility

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,880
um 2020 and uh gatsby

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,639
even in indicative of

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,840
a site generator those are very easily

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,880
processed by

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,240
uh by bots and by readers

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,039
um and uh highly performant

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
and really puts in the latest web

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
standards

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
um they're plug-in architecture those

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,960
both wagtail

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,840
and gatsby and highly secure

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,440
it's also a feature of static site

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
generators are they are very secure

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,360
because

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
one of the reasons is that it uh gathers

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,680
and collects all the data necessary

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,479
um beforehand and then it pulls it and

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
it

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,759
re-renders the site um only with the

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
data

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,280
necessary um to display what you're

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
looking for

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,680
um without having repeated calls back to

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,000
the server side which is a much

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,440
safer for uh in in experience

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
so i started this with minimal

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,280
experience with gatsby and glassql

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
um and not to spoil a surprise those

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
were

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,720
the biggest pain points i'll talk more

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
about those and put a little bit on the

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,680
screen

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
um just to show you how scary it is um

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,319
but it doesn't have to be scary

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
um one of the things that uh when i got

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,280
through

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
and will continue to show on the in the

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,520
tutorial

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,280
um was that there's you know about a

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
little bit over a dozen steps and then

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,280
you have a deployed site

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,680
and i'm i'm looking to make it easy for

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
everyone

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,160
i will also be discussing uh netlify and

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,599
get pod

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,160
netlify is similar to heroku with more

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
uh with different types of features um

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
and they have a different niche in the

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,400
market

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
um also providing domains and they also

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,240
have um

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,039
cms's uh that i've tried and compared to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,160
wagtail but

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,680
truly pale in comparison so um one of

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
the reasons why i wanted to continue

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
with blacktail

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,280
and then deploy with netlify is also

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,800
they deploy easily together

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,400
and bitpod is a

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,199
browser ide um

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,879
if you've used cloud9 or if you've used

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,240
code sandbox

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,240
um you've used something similar

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,919
uh one of the cool things about git pod

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
is that you can

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
have your uh it's all based off of a

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,920
docker image

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,880
um and you can also have um

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
shell scripts to spin up an instance and

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,839
um

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
uh of wagtail immediately and i can i

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,560
can i'll be showing you that as well

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,480
lots to come uh we'll get through it in

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
25 minutes together

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,080
uh and also there are more resources so

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
you can look at this later

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:12,160
[Applause]

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,920
all right so why headless wagtail

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,279
uh so one of the reasons

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,680
uh wagtail was really important

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
um i don't really need to sing the song

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
uh seeing the praises of wagtail if

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,519
you're familiar

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,920
um and i highly suggest going to

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,680
going back and looking at um some of the

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,440
wagtail conference videos we just had

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
wagtail space earlier this summer in

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
july

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,360
it was an amazing group of people um

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,120
and uh truly have like a a

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,240
a fantastic uh feature set

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,810
uh associated with it some things of

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,680
involving um um

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,040
[Music]

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,519
uh the way that the uh pages are

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,519
associated with sibling and child pages

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
um

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,480
make it intuitive for a

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,079
commonly used css cms so there's a

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,079
division of responsibilities and when

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,399
you're using headless wagtails

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,200
you're putting all of the data into a

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,040
big bucket

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
to be more flexible with the way that

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,200
you use it

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
and then blacktail also structures a lot

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
of the

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
the elements that they provide for you

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
um in a way that's inconducive to

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,760
atomic designs and atomic design is

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,440
great for

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,640
progressive web apps and javascript

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
and ecmascript funding

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
one of the sites that i recommend is

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,279
done by another

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,399
wagtail course team team member

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,720
uh caleb uh i recommend uh visiting

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,240
learn wagtail and there's a ton about uh

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
learning headless flagship there as well

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
so by gatsby um i already have a

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
background

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,279
in react and as i mentioned i'm also

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
interested in really fun shiny new

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
things

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
some of the key features of react are

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
already there reusable components as i

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,560
mentioned atomic design

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
and then you can also use uh just

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
regular

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,279
vanilla javascript in there as well just

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,160
like you can in react

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,120
um lots of things are responsive like

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
images

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,519
and uh the ceo is excellent that's

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
indicative of

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,399
react as well as static finer site

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
generators

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,000
the screenshot i have to the left is

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,680
the gatsby starter page i will also

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
continue to tell you a little bit more

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,959
about

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,959
gatsby starters

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,720
i am not a front-end developer no

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,079
desire to learn how to be a desire

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,279
a designer and um not yet

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,399
not yet um and

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,440
the starter page has hundreds hundreds

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,560
um of starter apps that look really

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,519
really great and

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,399
uh sleek and streamlined and some of

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,360
which are

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,880
like one click button where you can um

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,880
deploy to

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,279
like netlify cms um i want to be able to

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
take

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,399
that beautiful front end that is already

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,000
built out um tweak it for my purposes

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,639
connect it with a wagtail

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
structure the data appropriately and

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:39,839
deploy

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,839
and and do that quickly and easily

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
so more on why gatsby we're the starting

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,920
is super simple

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
uh you can start with a the gatsby cli

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,200
it really

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,720
is um after you npm install globally

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,279
exact ccli

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,800
uh you do got to be new and then you use

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,240
the

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,240
github um url for

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
the desired site well the name of the

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,480
site and then the github url

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
and then it automatically make um

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,839
provides that that site

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,240
um and the appropriate structure um

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,279
um within within the directory that you

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,399
specified

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,600
um it uses a lot of different sources

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,839
and so you can use markdown in there um

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
um and for those of you who are familiar

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,120
with um

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,360
like hugo or um or

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:48,560
satisfied generators like that do

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:52,399
similar things

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
so one of the great things or

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,760
interesting things about gatsby is that

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,720
you have sql built in

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
um and well you have to you're you're

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,079
adding graphql and it works intuitively

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,399
with gatsby

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,800
um so it's no complex server startup

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,959
it's

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
uh it's scalable and so when you're

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,680
using gatsby

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,519
it has this um glassy ql

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,720
interactive code explorer explorer

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,000
where you are able to query

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,040
and look into what your data objects

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
are returning and without knowing

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
exactly what the structure is going to

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
look like especially if it's coming from

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,000
several different endpoints

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,040
you're able to click down and navigate

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
through

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,079
um i will continue to when i talk more

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
about the tutorial i'll talk about the

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
setup and the things needed to um have

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
graphql

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,839
but definitely graphql was one of the

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,360
packages that need where needed to

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,360
uh was needed to be installed

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
so here's some of my resources don't

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,399
worry um

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
i'll show them again at the end of the

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,480
slides

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,160
um definitely wagtail and gatsby stocks

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,120
are incredible um and so i always start

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,639
there

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,920
both both also um have lots of

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,120
uh youtube tutorials caleb uh from

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,399
learnwagtail

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,120
um has tons of videos available um

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
for free on youtube but also on his uh

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,519
site

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,560
and then um uh gatsby will publish

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,079
lots and lots of free uh free tutorials

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,399
as long as a lot of

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,000
as well as a lot of fans of datsy will

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,360
uh well publish tutorials on

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,720
online as well um so it's really really

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
great um

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,600
two of the uh resources

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,199
from uh tomas capnic uh

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,240
nothing not thick

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,560
at torchbox these were guides they were

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
not

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,880
um they were not finished

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,839
versions of um but they did guide me

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
in the right direction and uh can

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
provide

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
more resources uh for later so i'm

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
really hoping at the end of the talk i'm

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,519
inspiring people to be really excited

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,800
about the stack and um to help

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
contribute with it

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
and so if you are please meet me on the

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,240
headless react

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,759
front-end graphql api uh wagtail

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,720
slack channels i will also be

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,399
randomly hanging out on the djangocon

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,639
ones

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:36,240
as well and you can definitely find me

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:39,680
on twitter

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,199
so here we have the basic um

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,800
structure of the uh of the app

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,079
so if you are familiar with the um

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,480
with uh django

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,360
you'll see that the blog app um that i

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
have is

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,000
a typical uh startup blog

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,079
uh you have the admin the app

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,280
models.py um

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
tests and views uh you'll keep going

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
down

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,079
home is an app always created with

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
wagtail

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,120
when out of the box it helps with the

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,160
hierarchical structure

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,720
of the way that blacktail automatically

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,280
provides your pages

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,799
we have a media folder my site is the

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
name of the application is the

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,120
is the root where our settings are we

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,520
have search which comes out of the box

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,799
with

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,000
uh from wagtail and then the site

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:42,000
directory is where we have uh

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,520
our gatsby app so on the right side

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,120
um this does get a little bit small but

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
this should look very familiar with any

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,799
for any of you who have done

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,440
a um progressive web app

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
on the front end either angular or very

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,960
similar to

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
react you do have your source and then

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,600
your components

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,600
in there you have uh various js files

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,679
with each of your components in there

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
you can see layout.css

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
uh so you can have the css right next to

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
your components or you can also split

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,360
them out into

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,480
files obviously

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,840
not it may not be obvious and then

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:26,320
we have images that image is

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,320
one that was created from um

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,480
that was uploaded in the back end in the

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,120
specified path

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,840
and uh then we have default four for

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,720
pages

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,720
um and base pages homepage etc

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,799
um

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,799
i'll give you a second to look over here

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,320
okay so how about we start with the

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
dashboard config

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
file this also may be a little hard to

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
see

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,600
but i'll be talking through it so um

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,039
we start out by describing the

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,799
uh wagtail endpoint

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,840
um and then this is where

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,559
we have our plug-in structure

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,559
uh and site metadata

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,960
so each of those objects under in the um

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,280
underneath plug-ins uh we start out with

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
dad

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
updates these source wagtails uh excuse

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
me gatsby source

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,720
f2l um but we also have react helmet

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,240
um we have transformer gatsby

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,280
transformer sharp which is for

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,799
pictures um and gassy plus and sharp

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,679
uh but there are dozens and dozens of

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,000
um of plugins that you can use uh some

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,840
are ecommerce plugins

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
and things like that

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
uh so yes as i mentioned tons of plugins

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
here's a few just

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,159
uh here's a few just off the top that

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
were really exciting

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,799
um so i recommend getting into

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,159
gatsby um and learning a little bit more

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,280
and teaching me some of these because i

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
haven't used all of these yet

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
okay so let's talk about what a blog

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
page could look like so these

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,760
are not um screenshots from the

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,480
functioning code

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
on the tutorial um but these are

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
examples of what

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,880
uh the blog page can look like um

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,799
the structure will be slightly different

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
in in the tutorial but we're starting

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,840
out by importing

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
this is looking very very much like a

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,880
react app

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:48,480
um we are accessing the wachtel data

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,679
this is the object structure

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,559
of you see cons page equals uh

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,120
data dot wagtail pages like support here

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,760
um

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
this is similar to what the uh what the

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,000
structure is for

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,280
the wagto app um when we are using

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,720
wagtails baffle um it automatically

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,720
connects us uh graphqls and

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,520
um the wagtail uh endpoints

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,320
um models um together and let's just be

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
able to query them

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,360
all right i'm gonna keep moving pretty

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
quickly

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,720
uh this is another important one gatsby

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,679
node.js this is

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,080
the um root of our file this is where we

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,400
start

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
creating all of the individual pages so

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
upon startup

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,360
this is the heart of what the uh

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
uh uh what the static site generator

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
will do

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,960
um and uh takes the pages that you've

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,120
written and then it exports them into

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,120
the

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
the end application and then we see the

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
the

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:59,840
graphql query um doing that

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,840
that final pull

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
here's a little closer view of what that

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,360
graphql

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,360
query can look like very similar to

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,240
all this so let's review um

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,200
let's review how difficult was it um to

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
navigate the project

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,919
with the experience i had i'd say like

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,600
5 um of 10. i mean we all come with

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
different experience levels and

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,799
different

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,120
skills so it wasn't the easiest

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,520
to figure out how to connect the connect

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,640
the two together

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,880
so i'm going to zoom a little bit

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
through what dipod is

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,720
hopefully you decide to look into its

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,559
features a little bit more and it will

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,000
also be on the tutorial

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,280
so what we do is we start out with a

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,080
fully deployed wagtail app um

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,600
and uh the environment settings ready

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,159
for us to start coding

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,760
and this is also the beginning of the

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,159
tutorial where we start

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,280
uh where we start uh integrating the

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,080
graphql or excuse me the gatsby app

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,280
that's the front end all right so gitpod

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,440
is a pre-built

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,360
development environment for any

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,799
environment like gitlab github or

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,480
bitbucket

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
uh if you just want to jump in and start

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,600
playing with a project in a sandbox

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,640
environment you are able to commit code

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,520
from directly from the command lines it

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,679
also has

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:37,679
a in browser browser

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,440
and it can export to a new tab as well

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
the workspace is also disposable which

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,240
can be a little wonky if you leave

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,320
something for too long

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,559
it will delete your workspace within 14

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
days but you can have up to 16

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
workspaces

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,039
and it's as easy as uh going to that

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
workspace

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,000
on gitpod clicking that button opening

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,600
gitpod and it brings you to this

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,159
um which is pretty cool and so this is

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,400
what a flagshow site looks like out of

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:09,679
the box

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,880
uh here is the um

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,360
the github yaml file uh we start out

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
with

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,320
a super user admin change me um and

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,279
these are the uh

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,320
steps uh it goes through to create the

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,080
environment

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,080
uh that is perfect for us

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,120
and we can also deploy with netlify um

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,760
i recommend tom dyson's lag total

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
network by

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,320
deploy uh github and tons of resources

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,159
from tom

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:48,080
is great um

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,200
a quick review a quick look at what the

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,240
tutorial is going to

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,200
look like uh there are

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,400
17 steps this is truly the entire

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,159
tutorial

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,840
uh in very brief form

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,140
i hope you can get a chance to come back

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,159
and look at this

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,080
[Applause]

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,760
very very similar to the steps that i

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,520
mentioned previously and just

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,840
highlighted briefly but here they are

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,840
in conclude form

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,440
all right so was it successful yes yes

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,919
it was

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,480
highly performant club site working

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,159
quickly

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,120
gradual playground getting them to play

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,760
nicely

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,559
grapple uh wagtail grapples definitely

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,559
helped

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
um but the learning curve on

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,600
understanding graphql in particular

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,840
um even with my guess my react knowledge

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,840
was

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
tricky

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,159
next that uh so i would like to publish

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,559
a

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,520
gatsby wagtail starter so we start

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,559
beyond

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,559
um where the just the wagtail tutorial

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,000
or the wagtail starter word

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,559
um we have a detailed talk here today

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
um at a more detailed talk here today at

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,320
python australia

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
um we do have a blog post to set up the

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,559
proj um process and we'll continue to be

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,320
blogging unblocking more on

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,760
building out the experience the whole

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,279
point is that both at

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:25,840
both frameworks are incredibly scalable

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:25,840
and then having a companion demo app

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
there you go keeps picking me to
