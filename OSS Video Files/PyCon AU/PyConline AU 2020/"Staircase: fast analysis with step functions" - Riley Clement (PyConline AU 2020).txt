This talk introduces the Staircase package â€“ a new open source package with applications in data analysis.  It aims to take the audience on a journey from basics to more advanced usage at a comfortable pace.   A tutorial-esque style will be used to introduce fundamentals, followed by four examples abstracted from real world use cases.

If you work with timestamped data and enjoy a little bit of math, mixed with a terrible sense of humour, then this talk could be right up your alley.
