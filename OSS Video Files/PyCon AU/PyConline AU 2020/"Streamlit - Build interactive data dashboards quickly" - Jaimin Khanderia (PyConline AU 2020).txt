Streamlit is a framework that allows you to build interactive analytical apps very rapidly. It is gaining popularity among data scientists and analysts around the world as it helps them make a data dashboard that is elegant and aesthetically pleasing. In my presentation, I’ll briefly state what is Streamlit and how it is super useful for data scientists and analysts. I’ll then go over the basic Streamlit components and examples that demonstrate how easy it is to make an interactive data dashboard in Python. (Yes you heard it right, no JavaScript required :D) By the end of this talk, you’ll know the basics of Streamlit and would be able to build an interactive web application for data visualization and analysis with just a few lines of code in Python.
