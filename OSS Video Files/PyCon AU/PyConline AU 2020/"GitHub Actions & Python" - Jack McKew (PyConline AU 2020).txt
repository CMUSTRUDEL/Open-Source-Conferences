GitHub Actions are free-to-use, plug & play blocks of continuous integration / continuous delivery (CICD). 

This talk will go into how GitHub actions help me maintain my open source Python packages (Pandas_Alive), and how I released my own GitHub Actions for automating the packaging of Python code to executables with PyInstaller.

Tutorial blog posts I've written:
