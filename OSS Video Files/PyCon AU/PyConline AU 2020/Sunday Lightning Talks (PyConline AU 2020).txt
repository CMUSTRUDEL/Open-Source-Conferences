00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
are from

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
uh pycon au this year i am confined to

the united states which makes me the

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
tsarin exile i guess for this year's

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
lightning talks

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,040
uh right so how does this go

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,080
uh we have 14 or 15 presenters who are

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
all going to be presenting

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,479
five-minute talks on topics of their

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
choices uh it's going to be

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,439
completely ridiculous uh there'll be uh

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
there's a whole lot of very interesting

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,240
looking topics here um

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
there'll be a stopwatch on the side of

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,280
the screen which will appear

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,799
like that

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,880
uh and i guess it's time for us to start

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
our first presenter is tisham da who's

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,920
going to be talking about

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
coding at home with kids okay

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,240
it can be heard cool so my timer starts

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,680
now

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
so this talk is about uh

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,119
this one on the back so coding at home

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
with kids

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
how i learned to share the screen with

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
my son

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,879
so i have been working from home like

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
everybody has been and screen sharing is

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,840
a big part of what you are doing these

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,520
days

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,319
so pair programming over uh

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
over zoom or all these clients so i have

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
counted around

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,720
10 of these things zoom skype teams meet

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
go to meeting webex gypsy one of my

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,040
colleagues used

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,040
so many things we have to install i've

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,400
recently moved into middle management so

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,040
it's an endless stream of calls

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,080
occasionally i have to let the another

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,200
screen a tv screen perform child minding

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,800
other than that my son has been taking

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,319
lessons over seesaw which is uh online

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
and he or she comes in and occasionally

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,760
we do

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,080
pair programming by getting him to

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
read the keyboard and write a letter at

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,319
a time

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
so he started early he started using the

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,360
keyboard early and

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,000
poking at the keys uh so i

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
started only using a computer in my 20s

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
so he's starting up

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,599
very early so

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
i it's uh one of the talks talked about

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
uh

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,599
mirror neurons and so that he sees me

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
doing something and he copies what i'm

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
doing

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
so that's sort of how it ended up this

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,879
way

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
this one is very close to my heart he

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,200
had uh some surgery

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,319
and we were watching separate screens

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
together he is all

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,840
zoned out from the pain from the

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,519
painkillers

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
and from the anastasia and i'm working

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,400
away

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,480
uh on a framework for for perfectionism

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
a drf plus react app which was going to

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,640
be presented the next day

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,879
in san francisco in techcrunch so

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
so we ended up trying to do things

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,640
together so

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,640
i call it pear plain i guess in a way

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
he's in front and i am telling him what

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,879
to do and he's just drawing lines which

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,280
is some sort of work

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,280
uh he um what's called as schematic

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
editing

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
he is entertained by two plus two and

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
keeps on adding numbers up which is sort

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
of his version

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,360
of the ender's game in

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
in the console here

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,919
he also likes doodling in blender uh

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
blender also has a very nice

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,560
graphical programming uh sort of note

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,040
graph mechanism for joining things and

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
making

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
changing them in color and so on so it's

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
i saw the unreal

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,320
engine sort of note graph it reminded me

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,320
of blender's note graph

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,520
he likes strings pascal likes trains

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
sometimes when we are doing pair playing

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
he would set up this

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,440
imaginary railways and such

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
and break up the physics of the train

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,400
simulator

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,880
train simulator runs into the trees yes

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,680
and run into the mountains and run into

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
the mountains

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,160
and then he can also do splines and

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
animations

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,039
[Music]

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,639
recently we went to the library and he

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,840
picked up scratch

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,440
which is sort of something

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
that has been talked about as visual

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
programming as well

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
what does scratchy do

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,280
and sometimes we make our custom games

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
custom toys

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,479
where this snake is

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,639
and then he designs his own games and i

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,720
try my best to program them on the small

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
screen

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
it's not easy uh you need to there are

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
lots of discussions around limiting

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,199
screen time

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,840
uh you need to find appropriate content

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,639
you need to keep him rooted in the real

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,479
world yes

00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:00,080
yes yes coming what when danny

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
yes five minutes are almost over

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
it's okay uh so yeah to keep him rooted

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
in the real world need to separate work

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,680
and play

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,039
and this is the fun times we have

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
so out of screen mini trains going for a

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,680
ride and

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,080
screen is still ever present for taking

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
photos and recording the moment

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,080
yeah that's all i have but it's uh imagi

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,080

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
i need to click

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
uh our next presenter is going to be uh

about a uh

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,160

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,520
in spanish please

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,199

about that shares content that's related

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,280
to game development in spanish um

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,120
a bit of me uh i'm a pedometer software

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,720
engineer based in wellington new zealand

at shia sees uh so if you heard some

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,039
easements talk about sega tour

i work with him he's awesome i'm also a

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,080
former game developer

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,560
at pickpock i started doing game

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,479
programming and then moved into doing

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
game analytics therefore i transitioned

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,199
from games into the engineering

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,120
and recently web tech and startups i'm

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,080
also a big outreach enthusiast i love

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
mountain biking

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,520
burden hiking and i like having one too

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
many hobbies

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
so what is this thing it's a it's a

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
python bot that interacts with tweets

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
that match a set of filters

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
it is the trippy library to access

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
twitter api

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,240
and it's basically deployed with heroku

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
via github real simple stuff i just

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
pushed to the master branch in github

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,479
it does the thing and hopefully it works

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
uh it has almost reached a thousand

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,639
followers that's

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
actually very cool um it's good to see

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,520
you know community building up people

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
talking to each other sharing ideas and

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
whatnot

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,479
uh here's some basic a basic example of

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,120
how like the main entry point of the

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
code works

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
something really simple nothing over

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
engineer right i give it the keywords

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,879
that i want to match for so you could

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,520
really just do hashtag pike online i you

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
and it will uh catch any tweets

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
languages

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
i'm just telling it to listen to the

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,879
spanish language but you could have any

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
other language locales that you want to

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
especially

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,599
you know english portuguese uh german

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,199
whatever it just creates a an instance

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,319
of an api you know what keys that you

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
give it to

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,199
it creates this thing called

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
streamlistener which basically tells

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,640
twitter

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
um and sweepy that every new tweet that

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
comes

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
live uh will get it and they will you

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
know

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,599
manipulate it and decide to do stuff

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,680
with it you know commenting or

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
retweeting or liking it

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,080
the options are endless uh this is

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
unstatus method that basically tells me

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
uh every time i get a tweet it uh it's

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,160
processed through this

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
uh part and i can go okay can i interact

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
with it

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
um cool then i will maybe retreat it if

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,080
it hasn't been received yet

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
otherwise it doesn't do anything it's

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
that simple

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
the book the code that says if i can

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
interact with this tweet is basically

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
saying okay is it mine

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,839
skip it is it possibly sensitive aka uh

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
not safe for work then skip it as well

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
uh is it a quote retweet uh you know

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
retweets where you add like your own

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
custom message

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
well skip that one as well and if it's

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,880
just a basic retweet then skip it too

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,399
i've been adding these flags because

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
sometimes you get like a really famous

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
boss from you know twitter and real

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
engine and

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
a lot of people are gonna um be

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
retweeting those and

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
it looks like you're spamming or do like

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
with a lot of duplicate tweets

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,640
and that doesn't make it a good

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
experience

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,399
what did i make it for me it was a

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
perfect recipe first i wanted to learn

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,440
how to make my own bot and i wanted to

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,399
learn how they worked

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,320
uh the opportunity uh was there as in

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
there were lots of game development bots

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,519
that shared content but none of them did

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,519
it in spanish

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
which is the language i speak um

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,120
natively uh

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
community well i like to you know i

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
thought there could be an

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
a great opportunity to promote

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,320
interaction between hispanic gaming

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
developers

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
and passion as i love building

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
communities you know uh there was

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
all this you know cool variables added

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
to me being like hey i could actually

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
just make this button it has a nice

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
purpose

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
challenges there are always going to be

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,320
some nice challenges right

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
um applying for the twitter developer

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
program was so tedious i had to wait for

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
like

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
two to three weeks eventually got my

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
permissions and my api keys that i

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
needed to actually

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,079
get started and the bot was actually

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
disabled for lacking posts

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,320
which is my fault because it violates

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
twitter's policies um

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
but then i modified the code to stop

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,079
blocking posts it came back to life they

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
were pretty

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
nice about it i just said hey um i

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
didn't know about it

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
can i just modify the con and would it

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,279
be okay they said yep all good

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,120
happened thank you for everything i'm on

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,519
twitter at tim rods and you can check

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
the bot at esgamedevbot

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,720
uh contributions are welcome if you want

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
to go on github it's just slash my

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,560
username tim rods

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,560
slash es gamedev dashbot

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
thanks juan uh one of the things i love

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
about the uh the python community is

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
that we

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
are a community and we do do uh great

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
work bringing people together and it's

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
uh

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,519
great to see yet another example of that

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
uh so one of the things with our

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,120
lightning talks here

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,680
is that uh we like to uh

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
we like to have some controversy and get

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
some talks that you know probably the

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
program committee wouldn't really like

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
to accept

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,640
because they they say things that are uh

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,160
kind of uh kind of controversial

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
uh peter here is once he's shared his

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,040
screen

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,560
or if his screen has disappeared

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
i'm just waiting for peter's screen to

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
reappear

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,680
right uh peter's talk is controversial

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,240
because it's called

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,120
please make him welcome all right thank

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
you very much chris

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,279
um hi i'm peter and i'm here to tell you

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,120
that java is better than python

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,800
uh hang on that can't be right because

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
we are at python we don't do language

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
wars

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
there's the right title when is

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,680
childhood better than python i'm here to

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,959
answer a question for you

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,480
so uh confession time um i am a java

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,399
programmer and when i tell people that

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,200
at pycon they um

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,240
say oh i'm so sorry to hear that um it

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
also means i

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
dress like this which um i don't

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,600
actually dress like that i don't even

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,639
own a suit and if you'd like to know

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,560
more about uh

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,160
how programmers dress stereotypes are

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,959
wrong watch my previous lighting talk

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,639
the uh

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,120
the fashion python au so uh let's start

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
with

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
um what's good about python so good

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,480
about python

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,320
it's quick and natural to write when you

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,279
get on a whiteboard and you start

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,839
writing

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,360
code in pseudocode fairly good chance

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,279
you just works in python

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,240
print hello world is literally print

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,760
hello world it's very easy to run

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
so much power though you can do just

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,880
about anything you want to in python

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,120
so what's bad about java java gets in

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,480
your way you need a compiler you need to

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
set up a lot of things to get that

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
working you need to know about classes

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
and objects

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,720
oriented programming just to be able to

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
write hello world your exceptions are

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
all checked like they are

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
if your code might throw an error you

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
have to declare that error and if you

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
call code that might throw an error you

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,560
have to deal with that error

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,000
and uh when um a program has a problem

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,639
and thinks they'll use java then they

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
have a problem factory

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
so given that why did twitter change

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
from ruby to java and sorry for using a

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,040
ruby example i proved this talk

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,399
like yesterday um they did this in 2011

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,440
they were a famous ruby shop

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,600
rewrote in java and the answer is

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,600
when you are writing a script a python

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
script or a javascript and i mean a

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,959
script written in the language java

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,399
nothing to do with javascript

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
uh we see that the python script takes a

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
lot less effort

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,480
you you you can just write and run it's

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
there

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,920
the javascript takes a lot of effort you

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,560
need to set up build environments class

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,880
bars

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
it gets a little bit hairy but what

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,839
happens when your script gets a bit

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
bigger and you start to have a team

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,560
involved

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,079
now you've still got the same amount of

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
effort in writing your code but you have

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,040
to deal with everyone else's code as

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,720
well

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,399
you're going to have somebody refactored

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
a method and now it takes an enum

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
instead of a boolean

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
and you didn't know about that but there

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,480
was no test case for you calling that

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,680
code and so it didn't

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
you didn't know until runtime things go

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
wrong

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
java will catch that for you the

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,279
compiler is your friend here

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
probably still less effort to just write

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,279
it in python anyway

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
but there's a step bigger than that what

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,399
happens when you have

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
more than one team all working in the

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,959
same area of code

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,360
um at that point

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,440
the java doing the work for you to catch

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
those errors starts to pay off

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
and there are tools that sort of make it

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,839
easy to use python you claim declare

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,480
your types

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
um you can you know add unit tests and

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
so on

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,959
they help but java has a lot of that

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,199
built in and ready to go for you

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
so um which is why if you go and look on

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,320
wikipedia like i did last night of one

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
of the languages used on the world's

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,000
most popular websites when you are big

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
and you have billions of users

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
you know these are there's a visibility

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,760
underneath java is number one

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
java's the most popular like it's used

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
in the most

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,079
of the um very common website that the

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
extremely popular websites python's

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,959
popular too

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,880
it's number three there which is

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,600
respectable job is number one though

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
because java

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
solves the kinds of problems that you

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,839
have when you have lots of disparate

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
teams all working in the same area

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
there are other ways to solve those

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,480
problems you could go to microservices

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
or which case you start having

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,680
infrastructure set up problems instead

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,639
of dealing with other people's codes

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
problems

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
um but java will certainly get you there

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,880
so um

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,560
what's my point here my point here is

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,079
that you need to recognize when your

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
favorite tool the tool that you are an

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,440
expert in

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,120
is the wrong tool for the job and we had

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
a whole keynote about this yesterday if

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
you missed it go and watch it it was an

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
excellent keynote

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,600
and uh in that keynote we learned about

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,880
the firefighters who

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,720
invented um who were lives were lost

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,560
fighting a fire um and

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
because they needed to put down their

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
tools and run from the fire they needed

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
to stop

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,720
fighting the fire which was their job

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,120
they had trained for and run

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
and they didn't know that and in this

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
analogy

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
java is not the huge fire that you are

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,639
running away from java is the escape

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
fire

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
which is a tool that sounds like a bad

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,199
idea

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,800
until you have heard about it and

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,639
practice with it and know when it's time

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,000
to light the escape fire

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,560
thank you very much and consider java if

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,279
you have java problems

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,480
thanks peter uh lots of interesting

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,560
feedback on the

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,160
on the stream on the stream comments

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,440
which i've just managed to pull back up

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,199
on my other computer

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,279
uh hopefully my frame rate should be a

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,240
bit better uh things were

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,040
getting a bit choppy just there okay uh

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,440
so

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,160
up next we have uh evan kahilis who's

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,600
going to ask us how we miss this please

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,600
make him welcome

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,520
hello cool so um this past term i did a

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
web security course at unsw

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,160
and we're learning various techniques in

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,199
this quaker bank infrastructure that

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,720
they had made

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
and in particular we had to learn about

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
server side request forgery

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,799
now to perform it on this code to get

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,079
the server to load content from itself

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,280
the first thing we notice is that it's

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,960
running python 2 code which is sad

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
but what it's trying to do is stop us

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,919
from using localhost using this deny

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
list

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,360
and what we can do is try and bypass it

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,919
using these particular functions down

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,400
here

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,520
get host by name um okay so quick

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
important tangent

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,120
did you know that you can encode

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
localhost as a decimal

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
but you can also encode it as hex or

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
octal or binary

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
maybe i don't know i tried these two and

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
they didn't work for me so we'll just

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,720
leave it as is

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,400
um but they also work on segmented bytes

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,520
so you can encode each different part in

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,039
its own base

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,039
um okay anyway which one of these works

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,160
well i tried all of them and said make

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
that octal works

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,520
and i thought okay this is a strange bug

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,799
and it got me thinking

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,480
does this work in python 3 2 well

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,360
no it doesn't um and this should be

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,440
cause for alarm because hackers might

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,280
try and attack us but who cares right

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
because python 2 is already retired

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,039
but the question we want to ask is why

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
did we miss this how do we manage to

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
miss a bug in python 2

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,960
well let's go and read the docs first

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,520
we'll go to the socket library docs

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,480
there's no nodes here for our function

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
which is a shame

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,440
um but surely the change logs should

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,880
have something right if there's an

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,559
update it should be there

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
well i search for the change logs

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
there's nothing there

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,919
okay what about a google search maybe

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,400
the changelog search wasn't good enough

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
nothing

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
all right well if it's not documented

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
probably the next step is to go and read

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
the source code

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
so here is the linked source um and we

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
search for the

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,000
the function name and it doesn't exist

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,600
why well because it's

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
implemented in the c um socket module

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
um okay so let's go find that here's the

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,280
result

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,440
and the full file um and here's the

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,480
function that we want to look at

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
and we'll look through some of the

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
function calls in particular set ipr

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,080
just seems to be our main function

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
judging by the length we'll skim through

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
it

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,480
um and we found the offending line it's

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
using scanf

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,160
but when was it removed let's go check

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,799
the main branch

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
we see this level of c code is just too

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
complex for me to read and there's no

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,039
documentation

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,880
um and i don't understand git or github

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,480
well enough to use it for a search

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,120
all i know is whether the code is there

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,200
or not okay i'll just use binary search

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
and then i found it this is the commit

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
that fixed this

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,200
and this is what it was replaced with

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
but wait

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,120
this is in 2013 in python 3.4

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
and where does this go wait this is a

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,799
pull request this is not the issue

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
i guess it's another dead end but wait a

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
minute let's use this issue

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
number in the bug tracker and aha we

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
found the original um

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,000
issue they found that it was incorrectly

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,039
parsing ip

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,039
and uh they found some bugs

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,640
and they also say that they suggest not

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,159
using ad hoc parsing which is what they

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,200
were doing before

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,720
awesome work but they also say that they

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
don't think this should go in 2.7

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
because it's more of an enhancement

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,440
rather than a bug fix

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,880
so this is why it's still there okay but

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,480
what if we search for other bugs

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,080
aha we found our exact issue

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,320
this is from 2016 and it's still open

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,559
uh and what they say is that this still

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,880
happened on mac os in python 3.

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
and i did and it does because i tested

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,360
it last night

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,559
and it's also os dependent

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
and they also say that they have the

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,880
exact same security issue

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,919
so actually these two are equal

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
sometimes

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
depending on your os but i guess we

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,480
already knew that because it says that

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,039
in the docs

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
at the beginning so maybe this is an

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
issue

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,960
maybe it's not but i hope you learned

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
something because it's

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
now 3 a.m when i was writing these

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
slides and i've spent like the last 12

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
hours researching and writing a five

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,799
minute talk about this

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,799
yes thank you

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,960
ah thanks evan for that uh one of the

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
things i i love about bug trackers

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
is that every now and again the python

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,320
project decides that they need to change

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,400
their bug trackers and now there's one

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
extra level of indirection of bug

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,240
trackers

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
uh for you to all uh click on when

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,799
you're

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
trying to search for for bugs like this

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,720
so hopefully this gets easier

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,760
hey up next we have uh kit darko who is

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
going to ask us

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,760
uh why not throw your devices in the sea

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
and go live in a cave

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,120
good question so um as you're probably

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,840
aware

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,799
we live in a world that is constantly

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
under surveillance

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
and increasingly so this comes in the

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
form

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,080
of corporate surveillance from massive

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,679
mega corporations

00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,880
in the us in china and other places

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,760
and in government mandated surveillance

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
so i live in tasmania where my state

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,000
government

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,080
recently gave every single person's

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
photographs from their driver's license

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,280
a private company for facial recognition

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,840
software

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,600
cool and normal and

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,120
one thing that i'm personally very

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
worried about is that a lot of

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,679
governments around the world

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,840
are looking like there's a not

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,840
insignificant chance that they might

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,039
slide into fallen fascism

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
and that's something that has

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,400
historically not gone well for a lot of

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,280
people

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
and so one thing you might think as a

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,320
reaction to this

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,640
is well tech is really handy

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,120
and i need to use it so

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
i need to protect my privacy so that i

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,320
can be

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
protected from these things you might

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,720
first do something like move to apple

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,760
and then realize that they're also a

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,640
major corporation

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,840
and they just say they believe in

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
privacy you can't

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,159
actually you have to take them at face

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,320
value

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,280
you might move to pure foss and then

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,919
host your own

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
server in your garage that you have to

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,960
spend

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,240
days tinkering with when it inevitably

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,799
breaks

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,840
and then you might just end up giving up

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,559
and crying

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,400
and thinking stuff this

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,799
technology was a mistake computers were

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,200
a mistake throw it all in the sea

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
i give in but that kind of misses the

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
point

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,440
so technology is yeah it's it's fun

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,240
it's handy it's cool we love it but

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
more importantly it's there to enable

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
human communication and human

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,400
collaboration

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,240
and it's enabled all of us to work

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
together in ways that

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,720
historically we haven't been able to

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,200
before it's enabled an unprecedented

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,400
level

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,159
of interconnectivity and shared values

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,760
and shared communities and

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,960
a lot of beautiful things also extremely

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,400
importantly

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,200
tech is increasingly used to

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
enable accessibility to bring people

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,799
into society in ways that they were

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,520
previously locked out

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,799
people who couldn't see people who can't

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,279
see people who can't hear

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,919
people who have mobility issues people

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:33,440
who have social anxiety

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:36,880
um so on and so forth find technology

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
has helped to interact with others and

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
to build

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,120
community with others

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,279
and also most people don't have the time

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
the energy

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,320
the expertise or the motivation to go

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,159
and self-host their own stuff either

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,440
so both the self-hosting i'm gonna do

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
everything in my little bubble

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
and i'm gonna go and live off on a

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,279
mountain approach

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,720
they're kind of selfish um so

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,799
what's the solution right um

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,279
so for one thing we're all software

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,840
developers so we can use free and open

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,679
source software

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,360
yeah where possible but while doing that

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
the important things that we should be

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,039
keeping in mind are not

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,799
what's a cool feature that can be added

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,200
to this package what's a cool feature

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,000
that can be added to my os

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,000
but rather what are some accessibility

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,120
issues here how is this

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,960
hard for people to use how

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,640
does this get in the way how can we

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,840
enable them in the way that the

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,840
private um corporate solutions do

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,159
and from them we kind of need to

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,480
advocate for change

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,240
that means getting political that means

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,559
you know letter writing petitioning

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,080
calling mps getting involved in

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,799
direct action and so on and so forth and

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,240
talking to people so that we can build a

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,600
future that's a bit more local

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,279
a bit more cooperative that's a bit more

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,520
publicly owned that's not so vulnerable

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,000
to

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,039
foreign governments or to corporate

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
control

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,559
something that just works a little bit

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,679
better

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,640
and that's a hell of a lot better if we

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,559
can get there

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,360
than just running away from it all

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,799
thank you thanks kit that was that was

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,400
fantastic

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,600
uh let's see uh so up next we have

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,880
uh henry walshaw who is going to talk to

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
us about something that's close to

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,720
everyone's heart

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
uh how to get outside during these

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,600
unprecedented times

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,400
excellent thanks chris uh hi all so my

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
name is henry

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,240
um i've been a gis geek for

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,240
a long time now um and because of that i

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,480
work a lot in python already

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,279
feel free to at me on various bits and

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
pieces

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,799
um so i want to talk about getting

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,919
outside

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,200
and making um having a good idea about

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,720
where we can actually go

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
during these kind of wonderful times

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,360
here in melbourne so a bit of a quick

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,559
content warning

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
at least at the start here i'm going to

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,159
mention a bit about covert 19 and

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,880
some of the impacts um so please

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,360
if that's an issue uh yeah come back in

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,840
hopefully

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,799
three or four minutes and you'll be cool

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,520
all righty

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,279
so just to get started uh in melbourne

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,080
we've kind of got a bit of a covert 19

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,000
problem

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,120
uh this is for those that know melbourne

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,640
this is the graves lane

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,240
at 9 00 a.m on a saturday um from

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,919
the middle of july sure but it's pretty

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,279
much the same now it's kind of pretty

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,640
dead and it's pretty empty

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
one of the big things that we've got in

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
melbourne is that at the moment since

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
we're under stage four restrictions

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,640
we're all kind of counting down to when

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,919
the premiere announces how long they

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
continue for

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,480
because we've got those stage four

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,279
restrictions we're not really around

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,720
more than five kilometers from home

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,159
okay so at least until the 13th we're

00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
not allowed that far from home and if

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,480
you jump on the government websites

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,399
um you can take a look at a five

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,799
kilometer buffer around your place

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,880
so this is me just creating a buffer

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,720
around my local train station here

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,080
the flight is actually is as it turns

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,919
out a pretty long way

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,480
when you're dealing with as the crows

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,200
flies just as far as you can get

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
but i'm a bit of a parent i love maps i

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,360
wanted to see how far you can actually

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,000
travel

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,440
five kilometers instead of going uh five

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,200
kilometers in a straight line because as

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,320
it turns out they're not the same

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,600
so first of all a few imports not going

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,840
to dwell on these

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,880
feel free to at me um especially if you

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
need a hand installing the spatial

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,360
libraries later on

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,679
they're always a huge pain which is a

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,080
bit of a shame

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,840
first step geocoding your address we use

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
geo pi for that because what it does is

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,320
it turns your address from

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,120
a actual string the place

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,000
into a latitude longitude point real

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
easy to do

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,840
and for those that watch some of the gis

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,600
talks on friday especially

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,760
you would have heard mention of

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,760
geopandas which builds in

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,039
geocoding as well and of course

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
unfortunately my little map symbol is

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,240
not loading there but

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
in the middle there you can see would be

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,760
able to see your encode

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,520
where your point is on a nice little

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,960
interactive map

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,399
okay so i did want to try this out with

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
geopatrick but unfortunately i ran out

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,840
of time so

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
sangashanan um i will promise i promise

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,000
you i will try this out

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,279
so geocoding it's built into geopandas

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
get yourself a panda series that

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,679
contains your addresses

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,039
turn those into a point that's easy and

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,399
again you can put that on map

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,799
i'm not going to go over that too much

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,600
just in terms of time the next big trick

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,120
is getting

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,799
the data the street network that's

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
within five kilometers of your home

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,080
an easy way to do that is to use the and

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
x library

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,520
which is a library to download um

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,480
the data within five kilometers of your

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,320
home

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,279
into a network x graph and we do that by

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
getting the bounds

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,200
based on a five kilometer buffer from

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
home okay so we can do that pretty

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
easily

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
five kilometers circle that's a 5k

00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
buffer that's the same one that we saw

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,200
before

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,320
we use osm and x to download the data

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,799
and this is the actual

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,799
data the points the streets as lines and

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,159
the intersections and traffic lights and

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,919
buildings and addresses

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,480
as points on a really simple map okay

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,480
we can do a bit of calculation with

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,559
network x to work out okay

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,559
what nodes are within five kilometers of

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
our center node okay we can easily do

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,480
that

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,320
borrowing heavily from some quick

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,919
examples we get a nice little map here

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,679
that shows us this is where i can reach

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,440
in five kilometers notice that i can't

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,440
get across the river here

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,720
okay it takes too long in terms of

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,679
distance to go around and cross the

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,120
bridges

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
whereas if i look at my five kilometer

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,000
circle i get all the way across into the

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,159
bank

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,840
so again i'm jetting through time so i'm

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,320
going to rush through this

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,840
um we use a network x ego graph to get

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,640
all the way

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,919
thank you chris we get an exterior

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,440
polygon which means that we can turn

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,559
that into what's called a convex hull

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,240
and here we can see

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,399
the difference between a convex hull

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,720
which is the big um the little

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,000
pulling on here and the big circle

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,679
rushing through this now

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,279
but we want an alpha shape instead so we

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
use the alpha shape library to generate

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,399
a more accurate boundary

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,840
we can do a bit of optimization but this

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,880
is essentially what changing the alpha

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,399
value does

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,480
how much of your polygons connected

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,480
together we can run through that

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
we can put it all together put it all on

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
a map with a bit of code and here

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,760
finally you can see a

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,760
more accurate polygon this middle

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,600
section here which is actually the area

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,519
which i can get with five kilometers of

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,120
travel versus the convex hull

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,799
where i can somehow cross the river

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
versus the buffer itself which is much

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,360
much further

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,640
and uh that's me thanks chris and thanks

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,279
everyone for watching

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,279
thanks henry uh so now you can find out

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
uh exactly where it is that you can go

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
to

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,399
uh to uh to exercise uh

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,080
now and i'm told uh that dan is having a

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,399
press conference right now

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,840
uh people will post all the information

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,360
into the chat because they're paying

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
attention to it so uh

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,960
you know maybe don't leave the lightning

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,360
talks and uh and watch the chat and

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,200
twitter instead okay up next we have

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,720
alan who's going to be talking to us

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,640
about uh open source data pipelines

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
uh thanks chris hi everyone i'm going to

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,000
be talking about a project called

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,240
maltano which is an open source python

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,679
project that look like git lab

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,760
so there's several components this

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,000
project um the actual

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,519
it's that the acronym is model extract

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
load transform analyze

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,880
notebook and orchestrate obviously

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,559
that's a lot to cram into five minute

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,919
talk but i'll give it a go

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,039
um so what is maltano um it's an open

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,519
source project like i say

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,640
it does etl or elt which is extract

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,960
transform load

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
or elt which is very similar it's just

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,000
obviously the load

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
happens before the transform so it's a

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
way of getting data out of the source

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,720
system doing some things with that data

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,640
and loading it into a destination um

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
it's a simple project in a lot of ways

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,519
because it

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,279
goes to this conventional configuration

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,360
approach so it bundles several

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,120
other open source tools and wraps them

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,559
in a friendly uh cli

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
and even gives you a nice front end as

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,399
well and it could be considered a

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,240
possible alternative to tools like

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,039
stitch or five trim

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,679
if any of you've heard of those or even

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,360
a more

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,600
enterprise level kind of turn key

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,480
solutions like pento or

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,320
that kind of thing um so yeah data

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,919
systems can be very complex um this

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,480
screenshot's actually from

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,240
a project which is a data pipeline to

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,039
get data out of goodreads

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,080
the reading platform and load it into a

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,200
data warehouse

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,840
it actually is um amazon emr and spark

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
to do this

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,200
as you can see there's a lot of moving

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,960
parts in the first diagram here

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,399
um so it's probably overkill it's very

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,440
complicated and especially for a

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,399
personal project

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,720
and there's no need this kind of

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,559
complexity so maltano kind of strips

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,559
away that complexity

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,240
and uses tools like dbt which i'll try

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,320
and get into in a second

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,760
um so the first step in the modeling

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,200
this uses files called

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,279
m5o files and to define your data models

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,000
and it's a bit similar to look ml which

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,760
is a from a tool called looker which

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,760
is also like a business intelligence

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,200
tool um so you can define your table

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,799
structures the kind of drawings you'll

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,360
be doing any aggregations

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,040
in this kind of file and then multana

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,639
will actually auto generate sql for you

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,399
which will help you in the analysis and

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,040
visualization step

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,079
um and for the extract and load it uses

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,879
stitch

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,399
which is kind of a paid for service but

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,960
they've got an open source um

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,480
component to that called singer which is

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,679
actually what martina uses so this is

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,720
all free open source

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,639
uh tooling um and yet by default

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,040
autonomous comes with a few

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,679
integrations so it has postgres

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
connector

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,200
you connect to various different sas

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,159
tools and marketing tools like stripe

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,159
salesforce

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
zendesk facebook ads shopify google

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,919
analytics and google ads

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,359
and then you can write that data to just

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,919
destinations so

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,960
by default it includes postgres

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,720
snowflake

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,040
sequel light jason l and good old

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,320
fashioned csv as well

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,399
so you can easily also add your own

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,520
custom extractors using the multano

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,200
command cli so you can do my tonneau add

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,200
and then the name of your extractor so i

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,359
created one for surveymonkey here

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,960
um so i just use the open source tap

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,000
survey monkey

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,800
and then in inside your yml file you can

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,480
just

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,599
set the kind of environment variables

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
that you might need to access that

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,280
service

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,280
and then you can test on the command

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,040
line by doing alternate elt

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
the name of the tab which is server

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,680
monkey in this case and the place you

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,880
want to send the data to

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,560
in this case uh target progress um so

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,160
like i say the transformation step is

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,839
handled by an open source school

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
tool called dbt which is also written in

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,880
python um

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
it's very simple it's just writing sql

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
basically but they've added uh ginger

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,599
templating to it so it's kind of sequel

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,280
with that bolted on

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,119
um i do recommend checking out the

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,720
tutorial and they've got a nice example

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,240
project called jaffle shop

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,599
which probably appeals to the australian

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,720
audience here so yeah that's worth

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,240
checking out

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,240
um i'm not gonna go into this in much

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,920
detail but this is an example dbt model

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,359
for surveymonkey that i built so i'm

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
getting questions responses

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,200
and survey details joining them together

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,560
and then doing a simple aggregation and

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,160
just counting the number of choices for

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,079
a particular question

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
um and then for the orchestration layer

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,040
it uses airflow again an open source

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,720
tool and a python

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,160
and so here you can use it to schedule

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,040
your data pipelines

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,000
um and control the um when they run and

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,920
that kind of thing

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,400
so you can also actually expose the

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,079
airflow ui using montana commands here

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,599
um you can also plug in alternatives

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,359
like free effect which is another

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,880
alternative to airflow

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,560
um and then montana actually gives you a

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,160
nice visualization on top of that so in

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,119
the ui you can then

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,000
generate graphs from that using um yeah

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,760
just multanis

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,359
language basically so i'll give you a

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,359
quick demo here

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,640
um this is the kind of connectors i've

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,359
got installed i've got perry square

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,280
shopify

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,520
and i think called aura which is ring

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,960
that i wear here to track my sleep so

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,040
i wear this at night and it records how

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,680
much sleep i'm getting or not getting

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,520
um i have this on a pipeline schedule so

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,760
here i can see the aura runs every

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,240
hour you can also just configure it to

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,440
use quarantine scheduling so however

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,920
often you want

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,599
oops um yeah and then i can then

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
turn the data in a graph format so here

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,280
i've got the network sleep i'm getting

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,040
which

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,560
probably isn't quite enough i'm getting

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,599
less than eight hours on a regular basis

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
but this is the graph that natalie

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,839
generates

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,480
thanks for that alan thank you

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,880
uh looks like the chat is very very

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,880
pleased

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,560
okay uh great so uh

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,079
up next uh we have uh matt sendra who's

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,079
gonna be talking to us about event

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,040
diversity inclusion and accessibility

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,040
please make him welcome

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,040
hi everyone my name is matt my parents

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,079
are here

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,520
him and his in true lightning talk style

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,040
i'm trying a brand new streaming layout

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,359
so please put your fingers for me and my

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,480
laptop which is about to melt

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,480
i'm here to talk about improving

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
diversity inclusion and accessibility of

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,240
your events this is something which

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,040
python au

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,240
and indeed pipe online au do very well

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,839
but there's always room for improvement

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,440
there have been some talks about these

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,119
things already but it's important so

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,640
here's another one

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,240
i'd like to start by acknowledging the

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
traditional owners of the land which are

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,720
broadcasting

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,720
the laranjuri and gunarang people at the

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,680
cooler nation and i pay respects to

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,680
their elders past

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,520
present an integral part of an inclusive

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,200
event is her conduct

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
a code of conduct finds success

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,280
unacceptable behavior for your event

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,440
consequences for that behavior and how

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,880
to get support

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,040
having a plan on how to respond to

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,920
creative conduct incidents and a team to

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,359
action that response

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,200
are as important as the code of conduct

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
itself

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
the contributor covenant is an excellent

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,480
place to start

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,400
next ensure that your venues are

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,760
accessible ensure all attendees

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
regardless of their ability

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,280
can access all necessary parts of your

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,640
venue including common areas

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
theatres bathrooms and stages consider

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,440
using captioning

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,520
sign language interpreters and hearing

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,040
aid loops

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
ensure your website is accessible to all

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,920
attendees too i recommend checking out

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,599
dawn's python yna utalk this talk has

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
been disabled which covers accessibility

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,359
more generally

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,359
there are more than two genders don't

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,200
ask people to choose between two boxes

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,640
they may not dig into

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,640
offer people the option to display their

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,720
pronouns in their online handles

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,280
and on their name badges do your best to

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,599
avoid gender bathrooms

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,040
don't only offer men's or unicef shirts

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,800
if you're providing merch

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,720
unisex doesn't actually fit everybody

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,320
give people an option for their informal

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,000
name at registration

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,680
some people don't use their legal name

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
and not all names fit the first name

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,760
last name pattern

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,440
check out kareena c zoner's talk

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,119
schemers for the real world and open

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,400
science talk collecting information with

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,800
care for more information on these

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,320
considerations

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,240
people are from different socioeconomic

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,400
backgrounds endeavor to offer

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,720
grants to enable attendance of people

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
who are less financially well-off

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,760
after child care you're at your again

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
it's not as hard as it sounds and

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,079
parents like your attentiveness to

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,760
explicitly make a space to welcome

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,920
newbies to your event

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,440
avoid content culture as described in

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,480
orange shore's work

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,520
and explain any in jokes you use that's

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,680
all i've got for now but there are

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,040
plenty of resources about these topics

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,560
feel free to contact me if you'd like

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,280

diverse underscore events or you can use

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,280
the qr code thank you very much

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,280
thanks matt that was fantastic

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,720
okay uh so uh

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,640
thank you matt up next we have kyra

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,400
patterson who is going to

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,680
ask us a very very important question

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,079
hi so i'm here today to talk about why

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,440
people

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,760
don't use password managers so to start

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,079
with

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
how many people do use password managers

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,680
so

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,680
depends on the study but it's around 12

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
of people who use a third-party package

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,839
password manager

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,599
and around 18 of people use the built-in

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,920
browser password manager function at

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,280
least some of the time

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,880
and why should we care so passwords are

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,920
anti-human infrastructure we it requires

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
us to remember

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,640
random things regularly

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,640
we're not good at memorizing and we're

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,440
really bad at randomization

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
so they're anti-human on top of that

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,240
about 86

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,280
of people admit to reusing their

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,680
passwords and two percent of people

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,119
use one password for every online

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,000
service they use

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,000
so until we can upload our brains onto

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,920
the internet we probably need something

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,280
to help us get around this password

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,440
problem

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,119
i gave a much longer version of this

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
talk about a year ago

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,800
and quite a few people have told me that

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
they're absolutely certain they know

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,720
why people don't use password managers

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,359
and they're usually wrong so i'll dispel

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,119
two myths first so first it's not

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,880
laziness

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,040
yeah laziness might contribute to why

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,720
you don't consistently use a password

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,400
manager but it's actually not why people

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,640
don't begin to use one

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,640
we're not as lazy as we think right now

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,560
there are people spending their sunday

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,160
knitting volunteering at conferences and

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,800
giving tech talks and listening to tech

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,280
talks

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,400
sometimes even all at once we're not

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,880
that lazy when we're motivated second

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,920
it's not because people feel secure

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
so 90 or more of people in every study

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,880
they've done

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,880
say that they're concerned about others

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,920
accessing their data online

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,760
they're worried about leaks they're

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,000
worried about being hacked it's not

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,800
because people feel secure enough

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,760
so why don't they use a password manager

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,560
so there's

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,119
five reasons and i'll go into them now

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,079
so

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,520
number five we don't like to use things

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,960
we're not certain how to use

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,200
we like to feel competent we don't want

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
to be embarrassed and a lot of people

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,640
are concerned that they either can't use

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,440
a password manager or they'll do

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,400
something wrong

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,359
and break everything forever it's scary

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,280
the fourth reason

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,640
is values conflict so a really imp like

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,040
a really common value

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,920
for adults is to feel independent or in

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,839
control

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,359
and most users of password managers have

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,920
reported that they make it makes them

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,599
feel

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
like they've lost control over their

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,640
access to their important accounts

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,280
number three we're pretty bad at threat

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,800
perception if the threat isn't a tiger

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,800
chasing us

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,240
most non-tech people still think of

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,920
hacking as being something that's

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,599
targeted at the individual

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,880
and they are aware that they're not that

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,240
important so they discount the threat

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,520
the second thing is we get confused and

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,160
we do nothing

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,800
if we're not sure what to do and experts

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,599
don't

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,079
always agree on using a password manager

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,440
and people

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,599
panic and just sit still but the biggest

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,960
reason the number one reason people give

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,760
for why they don't use a password

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,359
manager is actually security

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,200
download this free software and give it

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,880
all your passwords absolutely

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,240
sounds like a scam so you can't really

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,960
blame people

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,599
so to summarise we give something that

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,520
people

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,280
not sure they can use makes them feel

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,720
out of control

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,960
fixes an issue they're not sure they

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,280
have that experts don't even agree as

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
necessary and it looks like a scam

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,200
we can't really blame them for not

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,880
taking that step

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,400
so what do you do if you want to help

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,440
your friends you want me people to be

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,240
safe online

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,720
it's two main things the first is to be

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,000
really

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,800
clear on why and how the tool you're

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,040
suggesting

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
will solve somebody's problem let them

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,640
feel competent and like make sure they

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,560
know it's going to be effective

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,280
but the most important thing is be a

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,640
cheerleader not a fear-monger if you can

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,119
help people feel

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,640
confident and make sure you don't scare

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,359
them so much that they climb up and do

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,359
nothing

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,760
you'll be on the way so people are

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,760
complex varied creatures

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,960
but we share a lot of our basic

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,119
motivations

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,240
we all seek connection acceptance and

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,960
validation

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,079
and we all avoid embarrassment rejection

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,599
and danger

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,680
so if you want to help people change

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,359
their behavior and stay safe online

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,000
start by remembering that we're all

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,359
human and that's me

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,040
thanks kyra i

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,200
i always love hearing these talks about

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,520
the human factors involved in technology

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,160
and uh that talk was no exception

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,440
uh up now uh jason is going to be

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,520
talking to us about

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,480
uh what looks to be you one of my

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,000
favorite 1980s musicals

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,240
oh no it's actually chess

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,400
yep all right so um while i was uh

00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,000
sitting here in melbourne wondering what

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,480
i'm gonna do for the next few months

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,920
while i was in lockdown um

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,800
in a previous life um just

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,280
just over the straight back in tasmania

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,319
i'd um

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
i got second in the under 18 chess

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,920
tournament

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,800
and was led the team that won the high

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,160
school

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,599
uh state chess tournament so um

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,760
whoops so uh

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,920
that uh led me to

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,280
wonder what i can do with the with a

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,079
game of

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,720
essentially a game of chess so i played

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,480
it for

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,400
you know a long time but had to give it

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,160
up when i went to uni because it took

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,240
too much time

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,680
um chess has been played for hundreds of

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,800
years

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,720
it's been analyzed to death um

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,400
there's only a couple of opening moves

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,800
people use even though

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,800
um you've got potentially

00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,160
10 pieces to choose from people only

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,720
move like two or three

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:45,760
for their first opening moves and um

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,160
as of 1997 um

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
even the the best player in the world uh

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,400
gary kasparov

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,720
was beaten in a in a tournament for my

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,760
computer

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,480
um and here's someone who's actually you

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,960
know

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,359
enjoying watching chess so that there

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,520
are people that are like that

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,960
um so what i wanted to do was

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,000
essentially

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,520
get away from

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,920
computer analysis of of chess so much i

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,960
wanted to play against humans

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,960
um so what i ended up doing

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,800
was

00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,800
um three-dimensional chess

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,800
so um this this is more of a canned demo

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,319
at this point

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,040
so i've figured out how to use the 3js

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,079
library

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,559
that's that's that there on

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,000
uh how to place uh pieces inside a

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,400
at the moment it's an eight by eight by

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,400
eight grid

00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:56,559
um

00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:59,920
uh right so yeah

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,599
um i've had to

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,280
make my own pieces just because the

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,599
two-dimensional pieces don't make a lot

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,839
of sense in a 3d space

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:13,599
so um i even like just to prove it

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,240
that's my um my night piece

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,240
essentially

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,680
uh hang on um get back to that all right

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,680
so um

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:32,079
the idea is that uh

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,240
you um log into a uh

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,599
django server and essentially um submit

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,440
your moves

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:42,319
um now the notation for

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,880
chess is shows up here where you can

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,440
just

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,880
say like the first move in this in this

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,200
particular game is just

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,160
d4 and it means move a piece to that

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,079
position

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,440
but when you're in a three-dimensional

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,800
space

00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,000
this quickly becomes unwieldy

00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,280
so um notation for this is basically

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,800
going to be

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,800
x1 y1

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,200
z2 which which is going to be this piece

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,800
here

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,319
and specify the the xyz coordinates

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:19,839
of the finishing position

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,240
um there's a couple of uh concepts in

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,920
chess

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:26,800
that probably aren't going to make it

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,319
to the 3d world so well um one is the

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,200
one minute

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,640
right thank you um the concept of uh

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,440
castling your king

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,960
or um so this move here where he uh

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,559
swaps two positions at once

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,000
that doesn't make a lot of sense when

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:46,160
you're in a when you're in a 3d space

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,720
um i was planning on having the entire

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,240
outside ring uh being a bunch of rooks

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,839
but when you've got 20 of them in

00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,359
in a small space that doesn't make so

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,040
much sense

00:49:53,359 --> 00:50:01,280
um so at the moment

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:04,319
you can uh import new pieces yourself

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,800
um i've got here

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,400
uh positions and directions which a

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,319
piece can take

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,880
you can define a play area which is just

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,800
like

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,079
four by four by four or eight wave by

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,280
eight

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,839
uh a game you can import which pieces

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,880
you want

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:25,119
the starting positions and the idea is

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,319
to essentially figure out what makes

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,880
what works in 3d thank you jason

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,319
uh sorry we don't get to hear the end of

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,000
your talk but you know you only have

00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,280
five minutes

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,640
okay up next we have carl carsten who

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,800
uh is going to uh

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,079
answer a question uh to which the answer

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,440
i would give is don't

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,720
but uh well maybe it's uh

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,720
maybe he has a better answer

00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,880
am i up the clock started look clock

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,680
started

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,880
hello yes so chris i thoroughly

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,720
appreciate the don't

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,640
because when people ask me that question

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,800
years ago it was like ah

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,839
so much work to teach someone how to

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,599
program

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,559
when you have no idea what they're up to

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,440
et cetera et cetera you just want to

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,960
give them a little help and get them

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,800
started and kick them on their way

00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,559
and then i saw a talk by katnie rodner

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,559
at a convention and she was showing off

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,160
the circuit python express by adafruit

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,440
this is not quite a sales pitch it's

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,880
kind of like a sales pitch because

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,240
you gotta buy something and uh

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,000
you can get some of these things there

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
are very similar things you can get

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,119
these are all things that a little uh

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,160
that'll work anyway

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,559
so you get this thing from adafruit you

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,839
get

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,280
a usb battery you get a usb cable

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,200
you bundle all that stuff together a

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,720
little thing

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,480
shove it in your backpack so that when

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,400
someone says hey teach me some

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,480
programming you're like okay

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,520
we're going to take this battery and

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,240
we're going to we're going to plug this

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,240
little sucker in

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,480
and uh get a little light on there and

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,000
it's like yeah that's pretty cool

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,400
and then yeah oops there goes the

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,400
battery

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,440
live battery so

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,559
you hand it to them and inevitably they

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,000
grab it and see all those lights that

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,920
blink on that's because there's touch

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,240
sensors around the outside of this thing

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,079
and inside here is python code and this

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,680
is where you get into the explanation of

00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,760
there's some python code that said if

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,559
you touch a thing turn a light on like

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,280
that

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,280
and and then they say show me or

00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,240
something and how do i turn this off

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,520
and you're like okay well for that we

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,720
need a laptop

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:40,400
cue the cue the thing there we go

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,920
all right and so you uh you

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,480
plug this into the laptop and it is a

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,040
usb

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,400
stick i have a usb stick around here

00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,000
somewhere we all know what a usb stick

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,400
looks like right

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,040
you plug it in and a file manager comes

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,720
up

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,720
somewhere maybe

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,160
hey look at that file manager and we

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,800
click here on circuit pie

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,440
and uh look at that so there's this

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,960
little file on here called code.pi

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,480
it's right there and uh so you do edit

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,800
with your favorite text editor

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,520
any text editor it doesn't matter it's

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,359
text right

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,920
and look at that there's some python

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,920
that python stored on this thing

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,040
don't have to install anything don't

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,440
have to

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,040
dependency manage best practices none of

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,400
that stuff you plug this thing in you

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,359
look at python

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,680
and you say when you touch a1 this

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,800
neopixel comes on

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,599
see there it goes and then they say

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,800
something like

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,920
whoa how do we turn the lights off

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,960
and this is when it's like well now

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,319
you can sort of gauge for what they are

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,640
into and help them code the turn

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:56,559
the light off line and look at that

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,079
i mean like this will happen quicker

00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,599
than i can explain it to you because i

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,440
wasn't agreeing with chris or anything i

00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,680
was just you know talking to my buddy

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,440
and we're already like into coding

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,040
python and making things happening and

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,880
the person's engaged they

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,240
want to do things because they like

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,000
lights uh

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,000
now let's see if i can jam through the

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,559
rest of this we get this one oh by the

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,720
way

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,480
uh github link where i throw my secret

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,960
sauce on this to make it a little more

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,160
engaging than what you get from adafruit

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,760
so we have another one here with uh

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,200
some accelerometer code on it by the way

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,839
the device has just

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,720
all of the adafruit gizmos loaded up on

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,400
here

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:39,040
um now this next thing does require

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:41,280
installing the mu editor

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,599
but it's uh oh i don't know where my

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,640
mouse is this multi-monitor thing is

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,920
is got me going here i might do it on

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,200
time i got a timer over here

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:56,160
minute left all right um

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:59,119
one minute i heard that chris

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,680
so good mew editor is is on the wrong

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,119
window

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,520
okay here we go moving the new editor

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,319
over here um

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,640
it is an ide everybody loves ides even

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,680
us vim users like ides

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,520
so look at this this is like

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,000
eight lines of python if you include the

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,799
thing see this print

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,760
statement that prints a tuple sort of

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:23,200
formatted

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:26,400
this little button here called plotter

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,319
it is taking the print output

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,160
and making something interesting out of

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:36,000
it these are the xyz

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,680
so there it is uh the xyz

00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,280
of the accelerometer so when i wave this

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,400
thing around madly then

00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,839
then stuff happens and

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,000
once again this is so easy and people

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:52,000
are so into it

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,400
uh is there anything left to plug oh

00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,920
you're out of time carl i'm sorry oh

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,839
well anyway

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,200
that was kyle carsten that i'm muting

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:02,000
you carl i'm muting you

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,839
that was kyle carsten with a brisbane

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,280
2011 hat was that from the

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,559
next conference gosh that's uh

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,559
i'm surprised you've kept it clean all

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,520
these years okay uh

00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,240
up next we have anthony aegis who's

00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,319
going to

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,520
talk to us about something that seems

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,720
pretty important right now

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,680
please make him welcome yes hello

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,480
uh my name is anthony i write an email

00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,440
newsletter called

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,040
the sizzle and every day i publish it

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,520
and one of the recurring themes

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,040
is that facebook are and they

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
keep apologizing for the mistakes that

00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,599
they make

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,280
and they never change so in this talk

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,920
i'm going to give five examples

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,960
of them being gigantic and so

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,280
we can learn from their mistakes

00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,599
the us has quite uh strong and

00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,079
long-standing anti-discrimination laws

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,359
so you can't say in the housing ad i

00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,280
don't want any blacks

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,960
jews no jews for my house please you

00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,599
can't say that for good reason

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,319
um job ads same thing no women you can't

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,599
say that

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,440
however facebook allowed advertisers to

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,920
specifically target ads

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:08,559
not at these people so i could put up a

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,160
job ad saying i don't want any women

00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,160
in childbearing years i could say they

00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,040
want any people over the age of 55

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,599
to see my job ads i could put up housing

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,240
ads

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,359
on facebook and say i don't want jews to

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,240
see this because i don't want jews

00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,720
renting my house

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,319
100 illegal should be very obvious to

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,000
everybody but it happened for many many

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,160
years until civil civil liberty

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,040
groups sued facebook and then suddenly

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,480
they were able to

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,400
apologize and change and um

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,559
despite saying these things it hasn't

00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,480
changed you can still do those ads

00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,000
and that was in march 2019 that facebook

00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,599
apologized for doing these bad

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,920
things imagine being a moderator

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,440
for for facebook um you would see a

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,559
constant stream of

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,160
awful awful things um you would think

00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,520
that they would have systems in place to

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,880
hire the correct people

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,680
who have the uh right mental space

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,880
to handle the vile postings of two

00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,480
billion people

00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,319
um you would think that they'll have

00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,319
psychological support in case you did

00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,760
see something horrible

00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,240
and you think they would have policies

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,440
that would uh

00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,880
be sane and consistent throughout

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,480
um the time you're you're there so

00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,920
you're gonna have to worry about

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,599
deciding for yourself what's wrong or

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,119
right facebook tells you that

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,400
well they didn't have any of that so

00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,040
people ended up with ptsd depression

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,839
and substance abuse and a group of them

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,240
a group of

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,480
american ones sued facebook and as soon

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:38,000
as they sued facebook for their

00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,599
mental health uh uh problems facebook

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,799
gave them 52 million dollars

00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,520
settled out of court and 11 000

00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,559
moderators

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,000
uh went on to claim that they had ptsd

00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,559
depression and substance abuse from

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,079
their job

00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:55,040
as moderators of facebook

00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,839
um in 2012 the federal trading machine

00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,920
in the us

00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,680
told facebook your privacy settings are

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,520
way too confusing

00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,559
people are inadvertently exposing their

00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,079
sexual

00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,920
uh uh orientation their political views

00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,160
their business relationships and things

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,160
that they didn't really want to say

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,079
in public because the things were so

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,160
confusing they were saying it out

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,480
out uh out loud um

00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,559
facebook uh if the ftc said facebook did

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,520
this on purpose because they wanted to

00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,440
um

00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,040
get more information from people and so

00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,880
told facebook stopped doing that

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,640
in 2019 uh the ftc find facebook five

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,079
billion dollars the most biggest ever

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,960
fine from a government uh

00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,720
department um not doing anything to this

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,680
day it's still confusing if you know if

00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,599
you if you've ever

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,880
ever tried to log into facebook and

00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,240
change those settings

00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,599
it's still a mess um election

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,720
interference i think we all know about

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,680
uh cambridge

00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,559
analytica um the api for sharing

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,680
information

00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,599
with developers was way too broad um

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,520
donald trump's campaign used the all

00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:05,680
these all this information that people

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:09,200
unknowingly gave the pro-brexit campaign

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:13,440
targeted people with scare campaigns to

01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,920
influence their um election

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,839
thoughts and facebook has apologized for

01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,359
this many many times yet

01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,760
we still see this information happen on

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,599
facebook that has not changed

01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,839
uh and probably the worst thing that

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,319
facebook has been part of is a genocide

01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,799
um the united nations in 2018 um

01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:33,280
produced a report saying that facebook's

01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:35,359
lack of a moderation team in myanmar

01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,559
they had no burmese speaking moderators

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:41,920
so in myanmar the government posted

01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,599
tons and tons of um hate campaigns

01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,040
against the rohingya people

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:50,160
and because no one's stopped them um the

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,200
majority got so whipped up and hated the

01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,920
rohingya based on

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,920
uh lies that there was an ethnic

01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,920
cleansing and looking people fled

01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,240
25 000 were killed gang rapes fool just

01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,720
burnt down horrible horrible things

01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,520
facebook apologized facebook admitted to

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,880
their mistake

01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,359
yet they are still doing it

01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,880
so i think these five examples uh are

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:14,480
very big very broad

01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,079
but we know now what facebook has done

01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,240
i think we can learn from that to think

01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,119
about before you release your code

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,119
think about how it might be used um out

01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,319
in the outside world

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:28,240
thanks for that anthony an important

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,520
message there at the end

01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,799
uh up next we have jared quinn who's

01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,960
going to be talking to us

01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,319
about home automation and stuff if i can

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,359
click on the right buttons to bring up

01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:40,160
the right feed because

01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:41,760
everything is moving around okay hello

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,760
everybody i'd like to acknowledge the

01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,520
category nation the traditional

custodians of this land and pay my

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,720
respects to their elders past pleasant

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,920
and emerging

01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,319
so i'm jared this is originally a 44

01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,799
minute

01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,920
talk uh you can find the full one at the

01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,160
link there

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,839
um i've been coding for hurry way too

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,720
long now since i was eight and i'm in my

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,280
40s now

01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,720
um but let's get on with it here's some

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,079
of the cool stuff i work on

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,839
most of it's sports related as you'll

01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,480
see uh we do a lot of

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,720
uh everything from content to vr to

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,400
augmented reality to electronics so

01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,079
i get to play with lots of cool stuff

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,599
for work

01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,200
but home automation started with uh

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,640
with a problem we wanted to go skiing

01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,400
and we wanted to turn lights on and off

01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,760
that used to be an easy problem with uh

01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,520
timer switches and things but they're

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,960
harder to get these days so we went with

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,359
a smart switch

01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,720
uh then not long after that black friday

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,960
happened and i ended up with a bunch

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:37,359
more devices

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,720
however having two lighting lights

01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,440
having two lights that can only be

01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,920
controlled

01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,079
from a voice speaker is a really

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,680
annoying kind of experience for any user

01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,119
even me

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,960
and yeah guaranteed i'm going gonna

01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,880
start up through this slide and through

01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,400
uh talking to my smart speaker

01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,319
so we needed light switches pretty

01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,359
obvious really um now we're in a rental

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,839
so we can't really

01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:01,280
uh change fittings and things so we went

01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:04,880
with a radio solution being zigbee

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,599
however we had uh tp-link we had uh

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,280
xiaomi in the zigbee space and we had

01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:11,920
google home we had alexa

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,280
um it was getting messy and nothing

01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,200
would talk to each other

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,119
so uh spent a bit of time a couple of

01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,400
weeks searching around for a solution

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,880
and finally came

01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,920
to home assistant home assistant i came

01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,200
to probably

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,640
in 2017 uh its biggest appeal was it was

01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,240
in python my go-to language

01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:33,680
um it's built in async io python async

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,799
so very async all needs pattern three

01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,400
and um yeah it's really nice to code

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,799
code for and you should contribute if

01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,400
you do this too

01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,000
how does a config look like in home

01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,520
assistant um and yeah there's a lot of

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,079
slides missing from this so if it feels

01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,920
a bit disjointed i did it quickly and um

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,760
i can put the full slide deck off later

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,760
but this is what a configuration for the

01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,200
xiaomi zigbee buttons looks like in home

01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,960
assistant very simple

01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,119
uh the secret functionality is a home

01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,000
assistant function and the ui rendered

01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,880
there is the default ui

01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,319
we can script some automations in yaml

01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,920
and that just refers to different

01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:11,200
entities different conditions different

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,200
triggers and different actions

01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,440
and uh yeah they're the kitchen lights

01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,160
there for uh long press so on my buttons

01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,160
i do a

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,839
single presses the nearest light the

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,520
double press is the next nearest light

01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:23,520
and long press turns any light that's

01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,160
currently on of those two onto maximum

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,000
brightness

01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,160
so uh and that's the same on every

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,839
button in the house

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,760
however this all ignited a bit more of a

01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,599
passion in electronics which i hadn't

01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,440
really done much of uh since i was a

01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,280
teenager and since i've done this

01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,839
uh as a hobby i've started doing more of

01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,160
it for work as well it's been really

01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,599
cool

01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,839
i'm going to show you three simple

01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,400
projects you can build for less than 20

01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,839
each they all use less than 12 volt pc

01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,680
so you're not going to zap yourself

01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,599
too much with them no soldering is

01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,280
required but it's a good idea

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,920
uh and you don't really need home

01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,079
assistant to do it but it kind of uh

01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,440
adds to the experience so the first one

01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,280
i want to first i'll talk about the

01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,440
microcontroller i like to use for iot

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,480
applications and it's the esp32 in

01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,160
particular

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,880
um that's because it's got bluetooth as

01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,960
well but most of my smart automation is

01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,559
on wi-fi

01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,319
the first one i built was a fish tank

01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,680
monitor it was a submersible temperature

01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,799
sensor

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,319
and later on took over the roller that

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,319
first smart plug we got which was

01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:24,799
turning the actual 12 volt led light on

01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,640
and off on the fish tank

01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:29,119
this is what my fish tank data looks

01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,839
like uh so it's all served up over a

01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,880
mosquito

01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,400
and mqtt and comes into home assistant

01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,000
and this is all default ui

01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,559
from home assistant then we needed some

01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,960
moonlight

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,039
muji lighting and uh as you can see here

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,559
yep leds

01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,559
thank you led strip and some

01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,640
level shifters and a 12 volt power

01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,000
supply to run it that's a little one up

01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:55,039
in the top right corner

01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,160
and uh again on the network there's a

01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,559
picture of it there

01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,599
and some code in the ammo configuration

01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:04,720
for home assistant

01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:06,640
to to generate this ui here

01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,319
lastly we did an entry scanner so this

01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,839
was basically an integration into home

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:13,039
assistant's alarm feature

01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:14,960
it did uh rfid tags to scan in and out

01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,599
and would arm the alarm with everybody

01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,680
left

01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,480
that's kind of a cool one and that's

01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,799
what it looks like in home assistant

01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,559
now quickly before we end gonna meet my

01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,280
house this is the full ui or pretty much

01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,799
a full ui

01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,799
of my house in-home assistant

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,079
entertainment so first we have switches

01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,200
and general things the main the main

01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,319
landing page

01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,839
entertainment uh weather and snow

01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,480
information as i mentioned in the early

01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,200
slides i

01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,880
go skiing and um there we go thanks for

uh for our last lightning talk uh

01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:01,039
the general the world at large has memes

01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,559
uh on australia has memes sometimes

01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,319
there are talks that

01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,599
deal with the intersection of them and i

01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,480
think that's what rachel's going to be

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,640
talking about

01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,880
please make her welcome thanks thanks

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,880
chris

01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:17,280
this is our curly boy

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,680
this is the australian woman's weekly

01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,839
children's birthday cake book

01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,039
australia's most famous children's cake

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,640
book

01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,640
many many kids grew up in australia

01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,240
including me would spend so much time

01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,760
looking at this book trying to work out

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,760
what they wanted for the next birthday

01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,039
for my fourth third birthday i had an

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,039
echidna

01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,039
for my fourth i had a jack-in-the-box

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:48,240
and for my fifth i had the pool cake

01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:51,280
thanks mum and

01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,880
i want to make a cake but i don't really

01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,880
have anyone to make a cake for

01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,200
other than this good boy and he really

01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:01,119
shouldn't eat much cake

01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,119
but pycon line are you is coming up

01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,359
okay so first you need some cake you can

01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,039
make a cake or just buy some

01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,559
lightning talks from 2019 have a

01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,000
comprehensive list of supermarkets who

01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,960
buy cakes from in australia and new

01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,159
zealand for over the last century or so

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,159
you want to cut out your cake

01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,199
to make your curly boy shapes assemble

01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,520
your curly boy shapes

01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,359
make your icing using just over half a

01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,120
kilo of butter

01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,960
uh you might notice that the purple and

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,239
orange aren't quite as vibrant as they

01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,839
could be that's because i mix them from

01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:35,600
primary colors

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,679
they're okay if you want really bright

01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,080
colors just get actual colors and don't

01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:43,040
try and do chemistry at home

01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,319
um next put your curly boy together

01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,920
you're meant to put it like crumb

01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,640
coating on cakes so that the

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,279
crumbs don't seep through to the nice

01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,679
icing

01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:57,600
and it didn't work but i tried

01:08:53,679 --> 01:09:00,960
so putting on the colors more colors

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,679
until curly boy is taking shape

01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:06,159
um at this point it wasn't great so i

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,640
just added more icings moved it out over

01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,520
time

01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,319
had some fridge time and there we got

01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,319
our curly boy

01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,960
but it's a curl it's a cake it needs the

01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:18,799
finest lollies on a cake you just can't

01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,719
have icing

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:25,520
so my first thought was metacurly boy

01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,120
by adding some killer pythons onto it

01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,600
like i'm sure there's some pattern here

01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,640
but

01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,159
i can't think of it right now uh next i

01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,799
want to do an adelaide curly boy because

01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:38,159
that's where we're meant to be this year

01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:40,000
i could think of iced coffee and silver

01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:42,000
balls representing adelaide

01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,359
like yes i know it isn't farmers union

01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,719
but can you really tell the difference

01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,319
between milk bottles and lolly format

01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,480
so a message my assistant lives in

01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:53,520
adelaide how would you represent

01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,520
adelaide on a cake

01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,040
apparently there are also pigs in

01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,239
rondelmore and south australians love

01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:02,400
afl and wine i

01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,679
i was tempted to get some wine guns but

01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,120
then i would need to go to the shops

01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,719
again

01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,640
um a lot of defense industry in adelaide

01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,760
news call was founded first place to

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,199
give women the votes

01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,600
one of the first places where women

01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:19,840
could get uni degrees

01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:23,360
but how to represent on a cake

01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:26,000
so i thought about it for a bit and

01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,880
this is what i came up with so you can

01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,400
see we've got the

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,760
coffee milk bottles just hanging out

01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,040
i got muffs musk stick afl goal posts

01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,880
if you haven't had them before they

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,000
taste like perfume

01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,800
uh some stacked shiny silver balls and a

01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,640
car race because

01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,239
adelaide has a big car races each year

01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,920
um it was only when i was writing these

01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:49,440
slides this morning that i realized no

01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,560
one fought for the murders in adelaide

01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,679
but once again

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:59,199
how do you represent that on the cake

01:10:53,679 --> 01:11:02,560
um oh i have to play this video somehow

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:04,239
uh so i can't zip

01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,840
can i play the video no i can't play the

01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,239
video oh well

01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,840
um at least i can't work out how most

01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,960
contentious part of the cake is the

01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,760
duckworth

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,360
yeah it's all right i'll talk about it i

01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,920
try to put a chip beak on the

01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,679
on the curly boy yeah i'm on team don't

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,480

01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:27,520
post a video up on twitter

01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,760
um and this is my final curly boy

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,960
so starting at the head on the bottom

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,159
left

01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,719

01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,239
marshmallow flowers because i like

01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:55,840
attempt as a flip operator

01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:57,360
and finally the adelaide portion

01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,840
