	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,160
and welcome back to pycon au

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,839
education track for our next talk it's

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,440
an exciting one i am

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,599
very excited um i have the pleasure

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,679
of introducing brad nielsen with our

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,080
next talk about a website controlled

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
lego

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,439
robot using the raspberry pi um now i

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
have a fantastically long and detailed

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,039
bio that brad has requested i don't

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,320
answer

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,320
not quite um brad has a really wide

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
variety of experience across

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
uh development web development software

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,120
designing but has also been a teacher

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
for

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,960
um i believe you said a bunch of years

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,719
and has been doing a lot of really

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
interesting stuff in

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
looking at uh educational design and

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,079
learning management systems and i'm

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
really cool

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
i'm i'm really keen to hear about all of

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,360
the things

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
how that works into lego and raspberry

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,440
pi

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,800
and awesomeness so brad

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,920
away you go okay thank you

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,960
um so i'm really excited to uh

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
to present here at pycon as well um in

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
fact

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,799
i was looking for some kind of

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
conference to present this

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,200
project at um and a lot of conferences

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
have been cancelled so i'm really happy

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
that

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,280
icon wasn't um this this project i'm

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,159
going to present on

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
uh it's been the fruition of a number of

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
years

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,759
um of work so i've been teaching now

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,040
at morris college for about um

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
i don't know about eight years and um

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
right from the beginning we we

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,880
introduced python into the school

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,159
and um we then had to develop a program

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,159
uh around python that would suit

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,079
every grade thereon so

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,240
you can see on the side there i've got

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,880
uh the different streams of stuff that

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
we teach

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
at morris college and a lot of this is

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
actually mandated by

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
the syllabus so we're teaching python

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,799
programming

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,479
we're teaching web development and we're

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,920
teaching databasing

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,040
and we were also teaching robotics

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
and i find students are attracted to

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
different things

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
so some kids just love using pygame and

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
and developing computer games using

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
python

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,800
other kids just love creating uh

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
websites

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
some kids really love the databasing and

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
then

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,080
finally we have a bunch of kids who

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,080
really enjoy the robotics

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
and that love for robotics actually it

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
it actually becomes a little unhealthy

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,440
at times because all sudden their robot

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,319
their robot they name their robot uh it

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
becomes their pet and their friend

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,840
and they're constantly talking to their

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
robot and

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,640
it's just a really fun it's a really fun

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
project for kids to learn

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,640
about programming with and

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,800
what happens uh this year is that the

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,760
new queensland syllabus came in

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,760
and the new queensland syllabus uh

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,319
pretty much required most projects to

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,840
involve

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,120
sql in some way prior to that

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,760
i always had like a five-week unit

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
on robotics my year 12s and that was

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
using

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,200
ev3s and robot c and i was never happy

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
with it

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
i love the fact that kids really got

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,920
into it but i was never happy with it

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,480
because

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
it was a five week project and was

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
really really quite simple

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
um the only good thing about it was it

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,319
was it was uh

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,400
really quick it was really quick and as

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,319
a small little project for year 12

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
it it kind of suited that particular

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,560
time slot

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
so a new syllabus came in and knowing

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,440
that everything had to involve

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
sql in some way um and interface design

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,360
as well

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,280
then i thought to myself well do i do i

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
ditch the robotics project which is what

00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
a lot of schools have done a lot of

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
schools

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,400
in queensland now are just doing web

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,439
apps in some way

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,720
um do i ditch it or do i find a way to

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
work with the robots

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
and try to get the web application

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
working with it

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
and in my own mind i kind of thought i

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,359
can do this

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,479
so we um we changed the five-week

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,240
robotic task

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,520
into a 10-week internet of things task

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,960
and i submitted the project it gets

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,919
endorsed

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,080
by the curriculum authorities here i

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,960
submitted that late last year

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
um not actually fully knowing if i could

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
make it work

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
but in my own mind i thought i i kind of

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
think i could get this working with my

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
students and i think they'd really enjoy

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,919
it

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,160
so um

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
one of the things that i had to look at

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
was how do i get a website working with

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
the ev3s because

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
one thing about lego is legos are very

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,400
flexible the kids can create

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,479
lots of different lego designs

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,039
that you can suit different projects for

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,800
so the flexibility of lego is great the

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,960
problem is with the actual bricks

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
themselves they don't have inbuilt wi-fi

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,759
they don't have

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,520
video cameras um they're quite limiting

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,440
at least they were at that stage i'm not

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,360
sure whether the next versions of ev3 is

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,320
going to be better

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,680
however through robotic club we we've

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
been practicing with these things called

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
the raspberry pi

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
and the good thing about the raspberry

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
pi is you've got your wi-fi

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,600
it's compatible with a whole lot of

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,600
different sensors um

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
and it's pretty much its own operating

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
system so it's only it's

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,960
it's so much more powerful than an ev3

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,639
brick is so if i could replace the brick

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,199
with the raspberry pi

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
then i can do all that amazing advanced

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
stuff that

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,639
i know my students would be capable of

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
and the way we did that was we purchased

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
uh

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,160
an adapter called the brick pie so

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
um over in the united states says it's

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
really good company although they've

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,080
they were called dexter industries now

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,120
they've been taken over by

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,400
modular robotics

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,319
together that company produces this this

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,919
adapter that you can plug onto the

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,600
raspberry pi

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,560
and that adapter allows you to plug in

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
lego sensors and connects lego to a

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,039
raspberry pi

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
um so i've got the price there for it uh

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
the only thing is it doesn't include the

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,080
ev3's themselves

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,360
but in some ways i've leveraged it so

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
that

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
i've already got the equipment for the

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
lego robots we've got about 22 lego

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,639
robots

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,960
um at my school so it didn't cost that

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,120
much to then get the brick pies and the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
raspberry pi's which come with it as

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,080
part of that package so i've kind of

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,120
saved myself money as well

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
okay so what that meant is now in terms

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
of

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,759
system i can have uh

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
a lego robot but i can also connect it

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
to

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,000
a web server and i've presented

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
at pycon before on a web server called

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
flask

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,160
which i think is the best python web

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
server for students to learn from

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
and that web server can connect to an

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,319
sqlite database

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,080
both flask and sqlite uh come

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,840
now packaged with with python uh so

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,919
you actually once you install python you

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,960
get flask and you get sqlite

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,319
um so it's pretty easy for students to

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,639
work with

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,039
and the raspberry pi is is by default

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
installed with python as well

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
and because you've got wireless

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
capabilities you can then

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
connect to a wireless network and in

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
fact even

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,960
work over the internet so you've now got

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,280
an internet capable robot

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,360
that students can program with that can

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,440
also include things like

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,800
uh like a pycam which is video

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,240
or pictures in other senses so

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
one of the things i also did was we

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,520
purchased imu sensors

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,800
an imu sensor is like an advanced gyro

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,879
sensor

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
that can give you compass acceleration

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
etc etc

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
and we also purchased a thermal sensor

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
as well to go with it

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,000
and the thermal sensor was great because

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,000
it allowed us to do the following

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
project and that's what i'm going to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,560
present on is

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,199
the project that my students did so

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
we had to come up with a scenario and

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,080
we're mandated by the curriculum

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
authority to

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
try to come up with some type of real

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,399
world scenario um

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,919
and this was actually just at the same

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
time as the bushfires were going

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,360
throughout australia so

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,920
i was inspired to create some type of

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,040
fire search and rescue robot

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,640
and the scenario was that um the

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
students had to get their robot to be

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,680
able to navigate a maze

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
rescue victims and the victims were

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,480
actually

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,800
something cold like an ice pack

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
they had to map where the fires were and

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
fires were

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
represented by candles although i rip i

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
i actually replaced the candles later on

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
with a heater

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,720
um and they also had to be able to

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,640
so they had saved the victims from from

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
the fires essentially

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
uh you'll notice that the maze there

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
i've got red dots

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
i actually replaced that with red tape

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,279
squares later on

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
so one of the things about maze finding

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,640
is it's a lot easier

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
for a robot to navigate a maze if they

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
can actually

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,640
know where the junctions are so i'm

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
trying to make it a bit easy for them

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,560
but at the same time

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
i wanted them to be able to do automated

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
searching

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
and the students were actually

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,320
encouraged to either do manual searching

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,560
or automated searching with their robot

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
the most important thing is they had a

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,040
website that connected

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
and controlled their robot and that

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,160
website

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
had the controls for manual searching

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,279
and automated searching

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
and if they were going to do manual if

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,200
they were going to do manual searching

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
they are expected to have some type of

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,279
video point of view

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
for the robot and some type of mapping

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,920
as well

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,720
uh the students themselves have to do

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,760
the project requires a massive folio

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,800
uh so it's actually like 14 times a3

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
pages which includes their code as well

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,959
and they have to do a small little video

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
demo which i'll show off one of my

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,640
students work

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,600
later on oh well here's the demo here

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200
actually

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
i'm not going to go into the code too

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
much um

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
i'll talk more about the coding later on

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
uh so

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,640
this is a demo of a student's work and

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
i'm going to say a lot of my students

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,360
they didn't put a lot of effort into

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
their presentations

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
um because they were putting so much

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,160
effort into actually getting their

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
robots um to work so

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,000
the presentations were kind of like a

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,240
quick thing as an afterthought but

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,160
um this student i was really impressed

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
because he got his automated searching

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,600
working

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,160
um and his website was fantastic as well

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
so here's his his work now this page

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
here is the first page that the user is

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,320
greeted with when they go to access the

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
website

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
it is the login page and incorporates

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
the use of the queensland fire and

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,240
rescue service logo for some aesthetics

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
with a fire background all they have to

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
do is

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
click user details and submit to log in

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,640
when the user logs in they're then taken

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
straight to the mission control page

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,560
this is how they will be able to start

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,720
recording a fire at a path location

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,480
or enter a new location to start

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
recording the fire

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
this is also where the robot will be

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
controlled from and the path will be

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,760
displayed as it travels through

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
this page here shows all past fire

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,720
information

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480
for example if the user was to select

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
this fire details here

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
it shows them that the robot was being

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
operated by

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,040
the user admin this fire occurred on the

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
20th

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,920
of the 5th 29th at 14

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,720
16 42 it then shows the map of the

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
robot went it went forward detected a

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
junction

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,120
signified by the red small square then

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,600
also it detected a fire at that junction

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,839
signified by the orange triangle

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
went right and then went right again

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,120
this here is another fire

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,880
in this instance the robot just simply

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,279
went forward and detected the victim was

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,200
verified by a green square there's also

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
a sensor view page this here is where

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
all sensors of the robot are able to be

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
displayed

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,320
and are shown in live time back to the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
topic of fires the user has the ability

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
to select past locations and use these

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
to start recording a file

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
it should be noted that the page has now

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
changed that there is a live feed coming

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
from a robot's perspective

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
it should be noted that the latency of

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
this is actually pretty good

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,760
the user has the ability to enter a new

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,600
location if they would like

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,600
using these input boxes here

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,620
[Music]

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,360
turning right

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
turning around

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,959
closing claw opening claw

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,639
as you just saw the robot's key

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,639
functionality includes the ability to

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,160
move forwards turn left turn right and

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,920
turn around as well as being able to

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,560
open and close the core on the front

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,399
of the robot as you could also tell it

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
played music as the robot went forward

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
and

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
also spoke any commands that were

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
executed

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
the robot is now executing its automated

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,200
search function where it moves forwards

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
until it is stopped by a warlord

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
junction

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,519
and then follows the left-hand wall

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
until it finds the victim and then grabs

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
it

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
now that the robot has collected the

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,440
victim it will now follow the right-hand

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,839
wall back to the point that it started

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
at

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,279
thank you for listening and i hope you

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
enjoyed

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,920
okay so you can see the project there um

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,320
that student's done an amazing job

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
um just in terms of the level of

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
programming

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,560
so you can see that he's got his website

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,240
connected to the database

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,600
um and it's controlling

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,560
um and the he's also mapping the fire

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
and he's got uh

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,440
video set up as well so it was a very

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,800
challenging project

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,480
um and it's the for the for the actual

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,720
year 12s it is their biggest project

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,680
that they do that year

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,519
so kind of i'm proud of their their work

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,279
because it's the culmination of

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,399
of five years of learning um python

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,920
javascript web development all that kind

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,440
of stuff

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
but there were challenges in terms of

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,680
getting the project going

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,639
um one of the challenges for myself is

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
uh

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,760
i've still got lower end students in my

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,399
class who

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,079
um for them i've sort of cater for their

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,360
for their needs so

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,720
um and one of the things is i needed to

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
make sure that the functionality is

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,519
going to work

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
quite easily i need to make sure that

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,760
the functionality would be

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,880
accessible to what they're doing i

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,399
didn't want students to

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
lose motivation because their robot

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,040
wasn't moving so

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,880
i created myself uh or created them a

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
flask template

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,680
um because that's that's the web server

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,160
that's operating on their raspberry pi

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
and

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
the flask template pretty much had all

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
these really simple

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,600
functions available to them the most

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,959
simplest being move forward

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,440
stop i also

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,920
took a lot of the code that dexter

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,360
industries had for the bric pie

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,920
and i wrapped it up into an interface

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
object for them so i tried to make it so

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,759
that they could

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,320
pretty much tell the robot what to do

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,240
and then

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,600
they could focus more on things like the

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
automated search

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
and retrieval because one of the things

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,800
was once you retrieve

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
the victim it's got to then retrace its

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,680
path back

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
so i tried to make all the

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,639
functionalities accessible as possible

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,199
to them

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,120
that included uh wrapping up the sqlite

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,720
functionality inside a database

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
interface

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,880
um and then inside the actual web

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,480
template i've embedded

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,079
bootstrap jquery and ajax

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,440
i even embedded uh i even embedded

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,800
uh javascript turtle as well so um

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,000
just a way of drawing on the screen so

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,720
that's all there and by all means um

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,440
you can actually have a look at my code

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,120
because i've placed it up on a github

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,759
um other issues that i had um

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
sometimes the sensors uh had a loading

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
time

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
so when you actually run the robot you

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
have to kind of wait for the sensor to

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,880
have loaded before you

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,920
you actually access that data so if you

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
accumulate all that

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,000
all that sensor loading time you get

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
about four seconds before the robot's

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
loaded

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,759
which wasn't much but i had to keep

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
telling students don't tell your robot

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,039
to

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,039
do wait for four seconds um

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,919
threading uh was was a big issue as well

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,280
because a web server is creating threads

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
for every request that

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
is being made from the student so a

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,959
student's actually making all their

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,880
requests using json

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
they're they're still having to manage

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
okay um

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
if something is the robot's being told

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
what to do at a certain time

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,280
you don't want to give them a

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,840
conflicting message at the same time so

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,880
for me i tried to take care of all the

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,280
threading inside

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
my template that i created for the

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,039
students

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
um and that worked pretty well uh i

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
still had a small issue with the imu

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
sensor

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,679
where if you actually reloaded the page

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,760
several times the imu sensor would

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,360
would get out of configuration

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,280
and then finally there was some bizarre

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,039
error where the thermal

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,799
temperature sensor which is the thermal

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
camera

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,000
it turned off the motors as soon as it

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
was turned on

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,760
um it was actually kind of weird so as

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
soon as it was configured the thermal

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,320
temperature sensor turned off the motors

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,520
so i had to unless you're reading i

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
should say if you're reading from the

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
thermal temperature sensor the motors

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,600
turn back on

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
so i actually created a background

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
thread that is forever reading from the

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,039
thermal temperature sensor

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,400
just to keep the motors going um but it

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,440
all worked the students aren't even

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,039
aware of this

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,559
um although i did have one student

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,799
trying to create his own api

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
so he found the same problem and i had

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,760
to say okay this is this is what's

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,919
happened here

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,600
um and then finally the other issue was

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
covert 19.

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,039
students had to work from home a lot

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,440
initially in the beginning anyway for

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,440
the first four weeks

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
so i only had 20 robots and i've got 26

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,919
students

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,320
um and i didn't have as many batteries

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,559
either i only had like 15 batteries

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,080
um so getting them to operate their

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,840
robot from home

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,000
and connect to the raspberry pi via the

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,039
network took a lot of my time

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,880
um just because they were working from

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,840
home

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
um but to wrap up it was worth the

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
effort

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
um i'm really really proud of what my

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,400
students learnt

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,919
the actual individual skills and stuff

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,960
that they had to learn as part of this

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,559
project

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,360
um it actually kind of boggles my mind

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,080
actually because

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,080
they've had to do a bit of github let's

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,559
learn a bit of linux

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
they had to learn a lot about networking

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,160
because a lot of times they're

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,080
programming

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,600
programming their robot using vnc

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,760
so they were programming their robot

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
from across a network

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
they learnt more about flask and they

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,520
did a lot about the json

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,240
and the ajax and the javascript hurdle

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,919
it was just it was a project that was

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,320
full of

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,919
rich learnings where they had to take

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
all these different concepts and apply

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,720
them together

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,360
and my students rose to that challenge

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,160
so i'm very very impressed with their

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,880
work

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
uh thank you so i think i've got times

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,120
time

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,080
for questions now yes brad

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,600
thank you so much i thoroughly enjoyed

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
that talk um i

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,000
there have been some great questions um

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
i know it's not traditional but first

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
i'm going to start with some of the

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
comments

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,600
um there are a lot of comments like

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
lucky kids

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,880
um and really people being really

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,720
excited about the project um but also

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
uh a few people saying that they now

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
know what they're going to do this

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,799
weekend so i think that's fantastic

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,080
um uh some of the questions we got maybe

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,799
we can start with this one

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,520
um is what what you did to manage the

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,039
raspberry pi's

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,559
limitations without uh analog inputs

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,520
um i know it's a tricky challenge

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,600
uh yeah well uh because the brick pie

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,320
was on top of the raspberry pi

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
um i didn't have to manage analog inputs

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,120
um

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
all the sensors went through the brick

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
pipe so

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,280
it took away a lot of the difficulty um

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
mind you we we have done

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,640
we've done lessons on the raspberry pi

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,000
and analog inputs um

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
back in year 11. right at the end of

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,799
year 11 we kind of do that

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,480
but in terms of their project um

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,360
it was it was more software based

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,400
actually um then having to worry about

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,120
individual pins and stuff

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,919
great that that sounds great um one of

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
the other questions

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,080
was uh whether you bought the lego

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
sensors separately or whether you use

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,679
the nxt

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,840
kits um i don't know which is more cost

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,480
effective if you happen to know

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,280
uh we use the i i've got all the ev3

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,120
kits

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,640
um but i i really wanted those thermal

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,880
um the thermal camera sensor and the imu

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
is what we purchased individually and

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,559
they both were available from

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,000
dexter industries um and they were great

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,840
and because they were from dexter

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,559
industries they worked straight away

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,280
uh with the brickfire pipe just a quick

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,520
note

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,320
a temperature humidity sensor isn't as

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,919
as effective

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,760
as a thermal camera um so if you're in a

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,919
like a fire thing initially i thought oh

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,679
temperature sensor will be fine but

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
because heat diffuses

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,200
outwards so much you get like a one or

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,520
two degree

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,440
heat increase um when you're close to a

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,280
fire whereas the thermal camera

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,440
actually tells you what the temperature

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,799
of the object in front of it was

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,120
um so that's why i panicked

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,720
a little bit initially when i thought um

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,200
oh no i've got to do something different

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
here

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,679
but the thermal camera was great i mean

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,520
what's a good project without a little

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,200
bit of panic if you expect the students

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,600
to panic a bit it may as well

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
include us as teachers panicking a bit

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
as well

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,440
well that's the thing i i came up with

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,480
the project before knowing it was

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,679
actually going to work

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,600
so problem solving

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,760
it's one way of maintaining interest and

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,000
focus as for us as teachers just sort of

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
flying by the seat of our pants

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,120
um one of the other questions from

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,320
earlier on in your talk

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
was why the focus on sql um

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,919
i don't know if you want to speak to

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,640
that around the top

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,520
it's actually just in in the syllabus um

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,240
the syllabus

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,640
the new syllabus that's come in sql is

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,400
in

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,840
uh units uh two three and four so

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,120
there's four units in senior and um

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,600
sql is in each one of those units so

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
um i i thought you kind of have to put

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,159
it in your project

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,480
otherwise otherwise if you didn't put in

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,760
your project then

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
they're going to get to their external

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
exam and not know it well enough

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,919
so and you still had to store data

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
anyway so it was more of a syllabus

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,600
thing

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,520
but it worked quite well um like i said

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,880
sqlite's quite easy to use

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
and once i had created this database

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
wrapper

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,039
it was is as simple as the students just

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,960
writing um

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,320
modifier database and and they write

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,600
their sql query

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,919
it did it for them so yeah great

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,440
and it's it is always nice to have if

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,159
you're going to be teaching concepts to

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,720
students to have that

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,000
them enact that into some kind of a real

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,440
world project

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
um so they get a sense of what it's

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
useful for more than just

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
the exam so uh there's certainly some

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,960
nice elements there

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,320
yeah great well that's about all the

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
time we have for

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,840
uh if there are more questions uh i

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
think brad

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,880

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,320
track afterwards

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,279
um but for now um it's time for a bit of

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
a lunch break

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,039

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,559
