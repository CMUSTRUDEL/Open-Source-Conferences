We'll explore the history of typewriters and find homoiconicity where you might not
be expecting it.

We'll talk about structured data and explore the early visions of hypertext.

We'll look at some specific examples of unusual programming environments 
and consider how a fresh look at these ideas can be applied to modern development.

And finally we'll consider what a difference this could make to the work of programming.
