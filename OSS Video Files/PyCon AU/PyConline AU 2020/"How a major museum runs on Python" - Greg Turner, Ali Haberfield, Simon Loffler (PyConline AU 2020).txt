ACMI, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, is the most visited museum of the moving image in the world. In 2019 we closed our doors, to reshape our Federation Square building in order to become more public-facing, and to house a major new permanent exhibition, The Story of the Moving Image. 

As you might imagine, we have a *lot* of moving image to show, and a lot of fascinating objects to tell people about, all of which can be overwhelming to some audiences. That's why we designed and built a system called The Lens. Every visitor to the museum can pick up a Lens, which they use to collect objects and media to watch and explore in their own time. The Lens depends on a network of hundreds of Raspberry Pi devices to display media and interact with visitors, all running Opensourced Python code. All these devices need to be robust and maintainable in order to survive the 10-year lifespan of the exhibition.

In this talk, we'll give you a tour of the technology at ACMI, including our Internet-of-Things fleet and management tools, and XOS, the eXperience Operating System, which provides content and configuration to the devices.

hi folks welcome back to the curly boy

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,680
theater this is our last talk of the

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,200
block and the last one before the

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,599
closing keynote today

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,599
and i'm very pleased to introduce our

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
next three speakers who are going to be

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
talking about how a major museum runs on

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,359
python

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:25,359
so we have greg turner

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,359
ali haberfield and simon lofla

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,439
and this talk will be pre-recorded but

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,079
our speakers as you can see are all here

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,320
and

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
we'll be taking questions at the end so

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
we will be able to have them back

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
and uh just before we run the talk uh

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
there's a quick warning that this talk

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
has a discussion of covert in the way it

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
relates to the impact of

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,840
covered on museums and projects

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
so just a thing to be aware of and with

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:59,359
that out of the way i think we're

00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:01,520
ready to roll

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
good afternoon everyone today ali and i

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
are speaking from the lands of the

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
warranty people of the cooling nation

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,119
where acme is situated and simon is

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,920
speaking from the lands of the ghana

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
people

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,720
and together we want to pay our respects

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,960
to their elders past and present

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
and we acknowledge the sorrow of the

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,960
impacts of colonization on aboriginal

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
and torres strait islander peoples

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
and we also recognise their innovation

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
resilience

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
strength and pride

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
if the last decade was the golden age of

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,600
screen content

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
then this new decade is where we

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,479
collectively need to find ways to make

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,799
sense of it

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,880
to navigate through it and become better

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
people as a result of it

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
maybe this new age is the golden age of

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,040
attention and

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,320
intention acme is australia's national

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
museum of film

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,600
tv video games digital culture and art

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,159
but we're also the museum of things that

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,840
you already carry rounds in your pocket

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
with the museum of something we're all

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,119
experienced with

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,840
and which many of you helped to create

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
so how can we show the magic behind

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,479
something you already have in your

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,000
pocket

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
how do we add to that magic with

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,560
expanded experiences and horizons

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
and how can we help people become more

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
aware of their own intention

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
and attention when it comes to the

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
moving image

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
how do we keep everything updated and

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
running smoothly

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,840
and the answer of course to all those

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:37,840
questions is that we use python

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,569
[Music]

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,000
in 2018 we won a 40 million state

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,080
government bid

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,959
to completely renew what we do and the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
way we engage our audiences

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
this renewal project encompasses a

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
reinvented building in federation square

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
which contains heaps of new public space

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,599
to congregate

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,680
distantly and to share ideas

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,440
this video shows concepts from our major

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
new permanent exhibition

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,680
that tells the story of the moving image

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
from shadows on a cave wall

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
through early cinema special effects and

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,720
world building

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,599
right up to events that are happening in

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,599
the world today

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
i'm greg and i'm currently a freelance

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,680
creative technology strategist and maker

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,360
but i was cto for acne's renewal and

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
that means i've built some technology

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
but

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
more importantly i built a team of

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,440
people drawn from across acme

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
and from special recruits like simon and

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,159
ali and then i looked for ways for us to

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,480
create

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
new things and improve existing things

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,080
and let old things go

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
all in response to audience needs so

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,799
that acme could become this magical

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
place we want it to be

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
when we reopen

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,239
museums face this weird challenge

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
between having to

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,760
conserve data basically forever for the

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
public of tomorrow

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,480
and having to continuously invent and

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,239
create for the public today

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,000
and that gives us many paradoxical

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,640
questions to answer

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
such as how do we invent and create new

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,479
technology for an exhibition that needs

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
to last for 10 years

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,759
how can we plan for things like no

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,199
accessible cabling but easy

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,440
maintainability

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,960
how do we exhibit and tour art made with

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,759
technology we've never encountered

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,919
before

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
and how can we conserve that technology

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,040
for the future

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
how can we provide security when we

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,759
literally let the public in through our

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
front door

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
and can someone stop these kids from

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
climbing on our very expensive stuff

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,520
okay that last one may not be strictly a

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
hard way question

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,759
i showed you a tweet from simon wardley

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
just now and in shaping our technology

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
strategy at acme i considered wardley's

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
pioneers settlers and town planners

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
model of innovation

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
now these are uncomfortable terms in

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,840
australia so instead i'm tipping my hat

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
to bruce pascoe who tells stories of

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
indigenous innovation

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
and reminds us that this kind of

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,840
thinking well predates colonial stories

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
so we're using much more of this idea of

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
seed so as

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,960
cultivators and agriculturalists and

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
python of course helps us at all of

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
these stages

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,400
in assembling the team it was important

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,479
to find people who could balance

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,080
sowing the seeds of the new acme with

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
its needs to reach stability to

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,039
cultivate

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
and ultimately to turn a single

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,000
experimental seed into

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,680
a viable and robust crop of technology

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
and ally and simon are two of those

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
people and over the past three years

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
we've been lucky enough to build

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
a bunch of stuff using python from

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,960
experimental machine learning

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
on our video collection through to

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
rock-solid media players

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,280
to climate centers and some of it failed

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,880
and some of it succeeded some of it

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
didn't go anywhere and some of it took

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
us in directions we could never have

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,240
predicted

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,919
and so ali simon and i are here today to

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
tell you about some of our most valuable

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
experiences

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
over to you simon

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
working in museum tech is super fun it's

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
one of those rare jobs where you get to

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
let your curiosity roam free

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
and as long as you keep museum visitors

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
at the center of every experiment

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
you can play with whatever technology

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
you like the acme experience and digital

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
team

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,080
is all about enabling ourselves to make

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
new and better mistakes

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
uh learn from them and then pick the

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
best ones to make into museum

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
experiences

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,240
we're also really keen to connect with

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,479
you the python community

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
so as our software and hardware has been

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
reaching feature completion

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
we've been open sourcing it so that you

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,120
can come along for the ride

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
whether that be contributing to the code

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
base or using

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:49,120
any of our projects in your own gallery

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,880
or museum experiences

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,440
at the center of our renewed gallery

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,840
experience is the lens

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
this beautiful throwback to a viewmaster

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
image reel

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
is a recyclable cardboard desk with an

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
embedded nfc

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,680
chip visitors take it around the renewed

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,599
museum with them

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
and tap on any objects that they'd love

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
to collect and take home with them

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,360
boop after being added to the lens

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,440
the acme post visit website becomes the

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
start of a new journey for these objects

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,120
providing origin stories more

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
information about the creators

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
and also many side quests that come from

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,280
the constellations that these objects

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
belong to

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,319
to collect objects in the gallery

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
visitors look out for the soft

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
warm glowing heartbeats of our lens

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
readers we designed these with

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,160
repairability and modularity in mind

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
using as many off-the-shelf and

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
future-proof parts as possible

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
the acme lens reader consists of a

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
raspberry pi 4

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,000
running a python balina os image it's

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,560
also got some adafruit compatible rgb

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
leds to provide the warm heartbeat and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
an idtech kiosk 4

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,440
nfc reader to read the lens when

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
visitors tap on it

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
but why didn't we build a phone app well

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
we definitely considered it

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
but the advantages of the lans were

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
pretty overwhelming

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
there's a lower barrier to entry because

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
all the instructions that we need to

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
give are

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,240
tap on the glowing things uh so this is

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,360
really great for accessibility across

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
age ranges

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
there's also no batteries needed no

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
downloads no storage space

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
they're covered friendly you never have

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,759
to actually make physical contact with

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
anything

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
and most importantly they encourage you

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,719
to put your phone away and focus on the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
experiences

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
and the people that you're having them

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
with

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,120
that's not to say that phones won't be

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
part of acme's future but

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,440
right now the lens makes the most sense

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,440
to us

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
to make our magical gallery experiences

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,320
possible we had to choose devices that

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
were small enough

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
reliable enough and easy enough to

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,640
update replace

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
and maintain on 350 plus devices over 10

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
plus years

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,320
the logical choices were a raspberry pi

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,680
a dell optiplex or similar

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,680
or a bright sign

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,120
as you can see although the raspberry pi

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
is a bit cheaper

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
the risk involved with this relatively

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,440
unproven

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,200
technology is pretty big for acme

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
even when you take into account the open

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,519
source ecosystem and multitude of

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,959
deployment opportunities that arise from

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,560
it

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
so we started our experiments with

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
bright science attempting to love their

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,839
proprietary javascript implementation

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
write script but we soon found that

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
debugging was pretty difficult

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
and their documentation was patchy so

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
even though we got them to technically

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
work

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,120
we moved on after the relative pain of

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,279
developing with bright science

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
it was such a nice thing to return to

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
python and

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
playing around with raspberry pi's but

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,200
the big question was

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
would we be able to get them to play

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
1080p video for 8 hours a day

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,519
smoothly and reliably display museum

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
labels

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
which are basically flask apps running

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,240
on the same raspberry pi's

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
uh and also could we get them to talk to

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,680
the nfc hardware nicely so they could

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,680
respond to lens taps from the visitors

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
it was pretty pleasantly surprising when

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
they handled all of those things

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,480
reliably

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
i mean we had some glitches

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,570
[Music]

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
we had a few little stumbling blocks

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,560
with window managers chromium flags

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
and weird hdmi timings all running in a

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,920
docker container

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
but thanks to our lovely creative team

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
of software developers we managed to

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
solve all these problems and get them

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
running

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
really nicely so with a demo desk full

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,839
of functional devices

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
our fearless leader decided to place the

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,519
order and the next day the raspberry pi

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
4 dropped

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
this ended up being a good thing to test

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
our replaceability

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
and future proofing and although we had

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
a few sleepless nights we managed to

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
move our

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,920
images and our peripherals over to the

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,920
new arm processor relatively easily

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,920
one of the wonderful side effects of

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
using small expandable single board

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
computers

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
is that once we finished our feature set

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
we could keep experimenting with new

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
ideas to solve problems we didn't

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
envisage at the start of the project

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
one of which came up talking to the acme

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,760
registrations team

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
they were wanting to borrow a bunch more

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
objects from film studios around the

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,760
world

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,279
but they were price limited by all of

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,839
the climate monitoring software and

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
hardware that had to come along with it

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,360
luckily we were taking a pretty

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
proactive approach to monitoring our

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,079
devices by putting temperature and

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
humidity sensors

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
in all of the cases to check that they

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
weren't going to halt and catch fire at

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,920
any point

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,600
so we could offer a similar solution to

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,120
the registrations team

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
but seeing they didn't need all of the

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,360
processing power of a raspberry pi 4

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
we could offer this climate sensing

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
single docker container running a python

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,560
prometheus client

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,040
all on a raspberry pi zero the best

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
thing

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
is that because this was exactly the

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
same container that was running across

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,959
all of our multi-containers on other

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,440
raspberry pi's

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
we could use the same linting testing

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
deployment

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
alerting and monitoring software across

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,760
the board

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,720
it was the best happy accident to come

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,720
out of our demo desk

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,279
now that we had our giant herd of cats

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
we needed a way of feeding them with a

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,839
capable deployment strategy

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
benjamin found baleena cloud which is a

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
really nice way of deploying

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,880
docker multi-containers over the command

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
line so now

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,920
it's as easy as pushing to those devices

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,120
with get push blina main

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
excellent once the belina os image is

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
burnt to a microsd

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
or usb stick they handle all this

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
operating system updates which is

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
awesome because then we can just focus

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,160
on our own software

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
they also have really great apis so the

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,920
next piece of the puzzle to build

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
was a system that could push device

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,639
configurations to all those devices

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
through bellino's api to talk through

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000
this i'll hand off to my

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
fellow creative technologist ally

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
thank you simon you've heard a bit from

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,639
simon about the wonderful world

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
ecosystem of devices we've been building

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
to allow our visitors to interact with

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
our galleries using their lens

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
we also needed a system to keep track of

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
all this

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
each of those devices needs to know what

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,440
media it's meant to be playing on

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
every digital label in the exhibition

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,720
needs to know what work it's related to

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160
and we needed to be able to link those

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,120
visitor interactions with deeper

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,040
explorations of our collections data

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,399
to give you a quick demonstration

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,600
imagine that i'm in the gallery with my

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,440
lens

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
i found something i'm curious about and

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,399
i'd like to explore it in more detail

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,360
later on

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,199
i tap the label with my lens like this

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
and the leds light up to let me know

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,480
that my tap has been registered

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,800
the lens reader has now sent a message

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
to the tap's endpoint on xos

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
which records that i've collected this

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
label that connection can be retrieved

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
later on

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,360
using xos's api to provide a jumping off

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
point for exploring more about the work

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
that i was looking at

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,199
using django as a content management

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,480
system is a pretty established use case

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,000
but using it as a content and

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
configuration management system for a

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,880
bunch of internet of things devices

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,720
in a physical gallery it was new for us

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
fortunately using the blender api has

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
made that relatively painless it gives

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,279
us a central way of keeping track of

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,040
each device's identity

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,160
and lets us push content to devices from

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
a friendly django admin

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,600
being able to configure our devices from

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
the web is really handy but we didn't

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
want to build a gallery that was

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,079
dependent on perfect network uptime

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,240
so our devices cache their content

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
locally once our media players and

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,399
digital labels have downloaded their

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
material

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,560
they can continue to operate offline

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
indefinitely

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,240
one of the other key functions for xos

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
is to allow us to connect the material

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,880
we hold in our collection

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
to the experiences people are having in

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,480
the gallery this has meant solving some

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,600
puzzles about what to do with a data set

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,760
containing records

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,680
going back over 50 years with a pretty

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,440
high rate of variation in how much data

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
and what sort of data is present in each

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
record

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,480
getting a data set with this much

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,079
variation ready to share with the world

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
has taken a combination of very hard

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,199
work from our collections team

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,880
and a system of field fallbacks and

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,399
overrides that make a best effort at

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,800
showing the most correct version of the

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
content

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,199
as you can see xos sits in the middle of

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
a whole lot of really diverse systems in

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,600
our museum

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,120
and provides a kind of middleware that

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
allows these systems to talk to each

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,399
other

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,759
and share the information they need it

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,920
joins together the work of a lot of

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,360
teams that had previously been separated

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,720
and we realized we needed a way to

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,959
explain it within the organization

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,240
since xos has a lot of jobs or one could

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,519
say and i'm in a lot of places

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,839
we created socks our xos mascot

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,519
the name is xos spelt backwards and each

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,720
of sox's eight tentacles represent a

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,399
system within the museum

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
that xos is in communication with

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
as i mentioned earlier xos runs on azure

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,639
cloud

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,079
it's a dockerized application running on

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,240
a kubernetes cluster and using a

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,240
postgres database for storage

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,440
because one of xos's main jobs is to

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
respond to things happening in a

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,639
physical gallery space

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
while it has people in it we wanted to

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
ensure we'd be able to scale up our

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
available resources when there's a lot

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,560
of activity

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,600
that's between 10 a.m and 5 p.m most

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
days

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
and scale back down when the gallery is

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
closed

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,480
kubernetes is a wonderful tool for doing

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,519
sophisticated things with a cloud-hosted

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
application

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,399
but to be honest at our scale it does a

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
bit too much and takes a bit too much

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
management to be ideal

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
we would have preferred to go for a more

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,199
hands-off way of managing our hosting

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,720
and we looked into a few fully managed

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,720
options like azure's app service

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
what we found was that the specific

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,000
requirements we had around networking

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
with all those services xos interacts

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
with

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
couldn't really fit into the pretty

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
cookie cutter options offered by the

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
managed services

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,000
the scaling features didn't cover our

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,279
use case either

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,799
in the end the advantage of simple

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,000
management wasn't enough to make up for

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,039
the features we'd lose

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
so kubernetes it is

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,240
in kubernetes terms you might be

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,079
interested to know that we use

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
horizontal pod auto scalers for our key

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
apps

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,679
and a scalable node pool on the cluster

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,839
to respond to periods of increased

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,839
demand

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,799
of course to know if your scaling works

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559
you need some load on your cluster

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,480
something that 2020 has been remarkably

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
lacking is opportunities to get groups

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,559
of people together in a gallery to tap

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,160
on things so we've automated that part

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,360
we've built a few workload models based

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,799
on the number of people you'd find in

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
the gallery on a busy day

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,360
and the number of interactions that

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
could be expected if they were all

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,200
really excited about tapping on things

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,679
we've created testing profiles in jmeter

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
to send that traffic to our cluster

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,120
that's given us a chance to observe the

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
system under pressure we've used those

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,520
observations to refine the resource

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,880
requests

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,240
and limits for our containers while xos

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
as it stands today is a relatively

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,679
monolithic django app built to the very

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
specific demands of a museum of screen

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,400
culture

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
we can see opportunities to peel out

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
particular apps and modules within it

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,360
that could be useful to other

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,640
organizations in the cultural sector

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,080
we've done a lot of work to build a

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,840
really functional online system for

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,840
managing images and videos between our

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,120
collection the gallery and the website

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,760
and we'd love to see the usefulness of

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,200
that taken up in other places

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
we'd also like to make more of our cloud

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
presence like using cloud ai to help

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
fill out our collection data

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
and cloud transcriptions to bring text

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
to our videos we've done some promising

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
experiments with automated

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,120
transcriptions

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,400
this slide is from a 1960s film about

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
workplace safety

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
and this sentence has been transcribed

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,280
by aws's transcription service with 100

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
accuracy

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,039
no manual corrections required for film

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,799
with lower sound quality

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,039
the accuracy rate was lower but still

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,400
above 50 in almost all cases

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
which gives us some pretty intriguing

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,760
opportunities to provide searchable and

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,039
accessible ways to dig into our video

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,480
collection

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,919
we're at a point now where the bets we

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
made on cloud-based infrastructure a

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,240
couple of years ago

00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,679
are paying off in giving us some

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,520
promising directions to explore in the

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,039
future

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,960
thanks ellie as i outlined earlier we

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,960
in museums face particular deep

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,280
technology challenges that perhaps

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,200
aren't faced anywhere else

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,559
on the other hand if technology can be

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,840
made to work in a museum

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,760
there's a good chance it can work

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,679
anywhere else

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,520
so that's why we've been open sourcing

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,160
as much of our tech as we can

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,919
and you can find our code data belina

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,840
deployable media player

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,160
technology standards and heaps of other

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,720
stuff over on our github repo

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,760
and we write about it on our acme app on

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,120
our acme labs blog

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
now you're probably wondering when you

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,600
get to see all of this and unfortunately

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,000
our opening is delayed until

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,440
a date that is still to be confirmed but

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
that gives us

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,960
a bit more time to nurture these open

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
source projects so

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
if what we're doing sounds interesting

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
or useful to you then

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,640
please go and have a look and come and

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,480
talk to simon ally or me at any time

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
and if you do find yourself in melbourne

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,120
when we reopen we'd love to see you

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,039
visit and try out all of this new tech

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,799
and thanks for listening to our talk we

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,840
hope to be back next year with an update

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,840
to tell you how it all went

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,880
thank you so much folks for your talk

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
and um

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
we will get all of the speakers up here

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,799
now

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,799
so that we can answer some questions

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:34,640
um so first question that we have here

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,200
is um have you considered a trove like

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,400
crowdsourcing project for fixing up low

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
accuracy transcriptions

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,799
yes we have considered that yeah um

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
and that is definitely something we'd

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,320
like to look into in the future

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
brilliant um

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
god uh i think i've been reading these

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
backwards slightly

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,480
um with your hardware all of you uh how

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
are you planning for long-term repair

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,919
and replacements

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
do you want to take that simon

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
sure um we've we've got one of each of

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
the

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,360
devices that we've made on shelves ready

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
to just be whipped in and out and then

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,679
what we're going to do is um pull them

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,360
apart work out which bit is

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,240
actually broken and then try and reuse

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,240
as much as we can so

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
okay early on we were considering all of

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,320
the

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,159
specially designed um like raspberry pi

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,440
for video raspberry pi for

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
um uh internet of things devices but in

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
the end we went for plain vanilla

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
raspberry pi because they had the

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
highest chance of

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,640
still being around in some form after um

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,640
after several numbers of years yeah

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,480
great um and we've got one more question

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,799
here so far um what's hard way of

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,200
reliability like i think this one was

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
addressed to greg specifically um what's

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
hardware reliability like you might be

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
one of the bigger deployments of pi

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
hardware in australia

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,039
yeah i think we might be we've got what

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,919
300s

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,760
something like that box is full um so

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,039
far none of them have broken

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,760
um we we're planning so

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,400
so i i had to go into the office um last

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
month

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,679
um and we our demo desk was still

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,600
working the the synchronized video had

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,919
gone out of sync but everything had just

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,200
been running 24 7 since february

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,520
which is pretty lovely um however we

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
do we don't rely on that we have a tech

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
team who

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,600
keep who do it do do regular walks

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,679
around the exhibition to see

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
that everything's working the check on

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
the dashboard to

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,760
to make sure everything's reporting in

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,640
so there are multiple layers of

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,480
uh fallback in case something does break

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
and we do expect it to break it just

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
hasn't yet oh and i just wanted to add

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,240
one more thing which was

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,480
uh our previous experience with

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,919
raspberry pi's is that what breaks is

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,200
the sd cards

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,320
um so we went for the sandisk industrial

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,559
ones which

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,159
you can't find in the shops but a sort

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,039
of av integrator will be able to get

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,679
hold of

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,120
and so they're built for many more power

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,640
cycles

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
than um normal

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,960
great thank you um i've got another

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
question

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
i'm curious to know what does your team

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
make up of developers and engineers look

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,120
like that help to make this work

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
possible

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,640
yes so um

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,279
[Music]

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
it's it it's difficult to to define what

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,679
the team is because it's

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,080
spread so so far across the organization

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,840
so before i started acme had

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,440
um a an av team so

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,960
they're responsible for day-to-day

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,799
running of events and

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,799
exhibitions and then there's like an

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,200
exhibition technology team who

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
create a new exhibition and sort of

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
install all of the lighting and the

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,080
computers and the audio and everything

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,600
um so and then we had an i.t team who

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,159
keep all of the back office systems

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
working

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,840
and anytime you touch a computer as a

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
member of the public that's

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
um the it team of provision that then

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,880
kind of

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,880
hidden the keyboard and locked it all

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,000
down uh for us

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,919
um so uh

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,919
and then we had one developer before i

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,919
started who was like keeping everything

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,200
running and um what we realized was one

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,720
is the worst possible number of

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
developers for a medium they were better

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,000
off having zero or more than one

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,360
um and uh that's a quote from ali

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,559
and um uh

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,240
yeah so we we've we've grew our team to

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,360
five i think five or six depending on

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
how you count it

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,440
um to build the bulk of this stuff and

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
to make sure it

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,640
lasted for sort of five months of

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,679
testing

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,880
um and then now as we uh head towards

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,520
opening we're

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,720
um streaming slimming back down to sort

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,960
of operating capacity of two developers

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,960
um on an ongoing basis

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,799
great um i've

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
not got any other questions coming

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,490
through

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,490
[Music]

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,799
um

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,720
i think i just lost lily's stream i

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
think we may have lost lee's stream

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,240
there but i'll just jump in a sec and uh

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
just say thank you very much for

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
um uh give your presentation today and i

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,600
do have one final question if people are

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,240

um site as well where we're posting

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,720
about our stuff

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
and um benno has just asked what my

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
cat's name is
