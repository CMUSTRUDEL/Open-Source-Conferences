it will be a pre-record it is also

captioned

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,160
um before we do run the video i would

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,440
like to acknowledge because i did not do

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,920
it in the pre-record

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,600
that the video was recorded on the

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
traditional lands of the waranjuri

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,760
people of the kulin nation

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,719
i would like to pay my respect to both

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,879
of their elders

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
past present and emerging and also to

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,160
the aboriginal and torres strait

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
islander mentors from across australia

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,840
that i had growing up

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
and i would like to acknowledge that

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
both the war injury land and the land of

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,239
all other aboriginal people in australia

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
is still their land it always will be

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,520
it always was and that their sovereignty

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,119
was never seated

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,799
um i think we are good to roll it

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,640
oh i just wanted to say before we do

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
that sorry um

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
just to warn uh anybody who needs the

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
content

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,759
warning um there's a brief mention of

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,159
the 2020 australian bushfires in the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,400
covert 19 pandemic in this talk

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
um some mentions of injections and

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
implanted medical devices

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
and discussion of a proof-of-concept

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,600
hack that could be used

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,200
for murder um and uh

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,119
dawn is it correct that you'll be in the

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
comments for this talk as the talk's

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
rolling

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,720
yes i will be um you'll also find me in

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,560
the video chat afterwards

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,399
excellent thank you so much for being

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
here with us today and um

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:54,960
yeah i think i think now we can roll it

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:57,240
yeah let's roll it

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,479
hello everyone and welcome to pycon

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,000
2020.

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,159
it's very good to see you in the comfort

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
of your own homes now

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
i was supposed to come here today to

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,319
talk to you about accessibility

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
but unfortunately as i was setting

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,360
everything up to give this talk

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
i discovered that my talk had been

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
disabled so i'm actually going to spend

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,319
the next 45 minutes explaining to you

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
how you would go about re-enabling it

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,360
you can ask any questions that you have

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
at the end of the talk or i imagine that

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,040
i'll be around in the chat

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,000
so first of all who am i well

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,879
my name is dawn and i'm a devops sra

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,440
type person

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,879
i tend to wear a lot of hats one of the

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
hats that i wear is the hat of an

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
accidental accessibility advocate

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,239
which is why i'm here giving this talk

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
to you today

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
outside of work i am an occasional

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
author and kitchen alchemist

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
sometimes that ends really well

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
sometimes it doesn't

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,840
i'm also a raging sports ball fan which

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
is why that picture of me up there

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
is me at marvel stadium and why i'm

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
currently wearing new england patriots

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,360
jersey while giving this talk

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
so most of this fairly self-explanatory

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
but

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,800
accidental accessibility advocate i mean

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
the accessibility advocate bit

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,120
is fairly straightforward but how do you

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,480
become an accidental accessibility

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
advocate

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,599
well to explain that we're going to need

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
to take a bit of a world

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
tour and that world tour starts in

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
england

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
where we have this excellent disabled

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,760
toilet

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,440
that is down the stairs

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
not really the best place to have a

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,120
disabled toilet considering that most of

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,239
the people that use disabled toilets

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,920
can't get downstairs

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
but maybe the rest of the world is

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,920
better right

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
well once again we're going to stay in

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,120
the uk to have a look

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,440
at this disabled toilet which we found

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
which someone at a festival photographed

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,959
which not only has a handle which is

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,879
really difficult to open

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
but also has a piece of paper pinned to

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,840
the door saying door's sticking

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,519
please pull hard yeah

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,799
probably not too many of the users of

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
that bathroom are going to have the

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,360
capability to pull hard

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
next we're going to head over to new

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
zealand

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
where we have this excellent access ramp

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,480
to a building

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,080
which someone has obscured by putting a

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
couple of orange traffic cones in front

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
of it

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,160
the power chair user who's sitting and

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,440
looking at it is probably not very

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
pleased because they can't get into

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,759
wherever they wanted to go

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
and finally we're going to have a look

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,400
at the city that i live in and that is

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
melbourne

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
which has these exolus which people

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
generally describe

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,720
as uh space-age public toilets they're

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,000
great they're self-cleaning

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,360
so why are they in a world tour

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,560
about accessibility advocacy well

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,199
that's because the exolus in melbourne

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
actually have braille on all of their

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,600
signage and inside the toilets

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,280
there is a sign that explains that when

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
the light on the sign goes on

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,759
one should vacate the toilet because it

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,400
is about to enter its cleaning routine

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,680
unfortunately the braille text in that

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,280
toilet says

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,680
exactly the same thing

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
i mean there's a thing there about being

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,520
blind and not being able to see light

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,240
i don't know so

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,320
before we continue it would probably be

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,600
helpful to define a couple of times

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,360
first of all disability is pretty much

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
defined as a continuing condition which

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
restricts everyday activities

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,440
so legally in australia continuing

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
condition means a condition that's going

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
to last for six months or more

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
and the restricting everyday activities

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
bit is pretty self-explanatory

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
accessibility is not just about

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
disability though it's really about the

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
degree to which an activity can be done

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
by everyone

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
and some things might be inaccessible to

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,639
disabled people but accessible to

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,080
non-disabled people

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,680
but you might also have things that are

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
accessible to say white people but not

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,240
to black people

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,080
or me to men but not to women

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
and warning this is where we get

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,120
political for a moment

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
so there are roughly two different ways

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
that one can consider

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
accessibility you can look at disability

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
and accessibility in terms of the

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
medical model

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
which holds that it's disability itself

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
that's the problem and that that's

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
something that we should try to fix

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
alternatively you can look at the social

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,360
model which holds that it's not

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,080
really the disability that's the problem

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
it's the fact

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
that the world's not designed with

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,039
disability in mind and so things end up

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,919
being inaccessible

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,520
and that's sort of illustrated by these

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
pictures that we've got up here where we

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
have

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,080
to illustrate the medical model we have

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,000
the vaguely doctor looking blob

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
comfortingly blob in a wheelchair

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
on the other hand with the social model

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
when it's done well you get things like

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
adaptive sport and so we've got these

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
folks who are playing sport in

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,800
wheelchairs and

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
let's be honest they look pretty happy

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,560
with that so

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,160
for the purposes of this talk we're

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
going to look at disability in terms of

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,880
the social model

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
i wouldn't want to dismiss the medical

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,599
model entirely because there has been a

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,039
lot of

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
things in the world that have improved

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,840
because of the medical model but we'll

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
just focus on the social model for the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,759
moment

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,560
there are a couple more terms then that

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
we need to define so accessible design

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
is about building a world that everyone

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
can navigate and use

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
now i said that that's not just about

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,720
disability some of you who've been

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,360
around for a while

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
might remember hp's racist webcam in

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,880
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,000
where a black gentleman had taken a

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
video of himself

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
with hp's face tracking webcam couldn't

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,240
track his face but it could track the

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
face of his white colleague

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,639
that's the kind of thing that we talk

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
about when we're talking about

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
accessible design

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,360
and a lot of accessible design for

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
disability is about things like

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
making sure that people can get in

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,360
buildings but also things like making

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,280
sure that people can use technology

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
which brings us to adaptive technology

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
and that's roughly

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
tools that disabled people use to

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
improve their access to the world

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
now that can actually be really low tech

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160
this my walking stick

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
is a piece of adaptive technology

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,360
wheelchairs are adaptive technology

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,360
but as sort of technology in general has

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
become more of a thing in society

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,360
we have adaptive technology like screen

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
readers which blind and dyslexic people

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
might use to get around websites

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
we have adaptive technology like aac

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
which is used by non-speaking people to

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
communicate so

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,240
adaptive technology really runs the

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,479
government

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
and for the vast and majority of you

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,080
here today if not all of you

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
this is part of your job doesn't matter

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
whether you're a designer a coder a

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
devops person

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
even a manager accessibility is

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,240
something that you should consider

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,760
every day when you go to work because

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,000
if you don't do it then who will

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
now you may be wondering how you would

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
go about doing that and

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
the first thing that i want to talk

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,200
about here is this idea that accessible

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,360
design is good design

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
and that doesn't mean that if you design

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,160
things well they'll be inherently

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
accessible

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,800
it doesn't mean that accessible design

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,519
is good although that's also often true

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,920
what it means is that part of good

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,160
design and part of designing things well

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
is considering accessibility and make

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,959
sure making sure that you design things

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,600
accessibly

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,920
generally what i've found is that if

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
your website or blog or application is

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
badly designed

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,080
it's probably also going to be

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,399
inaccessible

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,839
let's look at a case in point this is

00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,240
armgren.net and i didn't have to look

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
very hard to find this it's actually on

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
quite a number of top 10 worst websites

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
ever lists

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
now you can see when you're looking at

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,040
it it's not really very logical

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,399
there's not a consistent layout there

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,680
are a lot of images that are all

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
different sizes

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
the text is all different sizes there's

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
a huge number of colors i mean

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,320
maybe it would make more sense if you

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
spoke norwegian but it's still not

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
really the easiest website in the world

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,959
to get around

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,200
and indeed if you look at the

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,519
accessibility of arngren.net

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,200
that's also not great for starters just

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
imagine how hard it would be to work out

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
what's going on if you're colorblind

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,040
there's a lot of red and green there

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
because nothing's in a logical order

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
it's really hard if you're using

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
keyboard navigation or if you're using a

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
screen reader

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,279
to actually get around the website a lot

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,720
of the pictures don't have alt text

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
and a lot of the pictures aren't even

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,240
placed in logical places

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
so someone with an intellectual or

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,279
cognitive disability

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,440
might not actually understand what's

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,320
linked to what

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,760
and then we have distinctive design this

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,079
is ling's cars

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,839
now linux cars interestingly enough is

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,519
actually one of the most successful car

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,160
leasing businesses in the uk

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
and lin the owner has really built her

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,200
brand

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
around having this website that kind of

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,680
it's very unique very distinctive and it

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,240
draws people in

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
and it's accessible in some aspects but

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,079
not in others

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
so if you want to actually take a look

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,399
at the website i mean

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,320
you can't really see it in the

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,320
screenshot but the tongue is animated

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
the traffic lights are animated ling's

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
face is animated and

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,880
my favorite which i couldn't actually

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,279
get into the screenshot

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,760
is it just below the youtube video ling

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,480
has an animated gif of boris

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,360
johnson describing the boris brexit

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
guarantee

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,279
which is the guarantee that if the uk

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
leaves the european union which it now

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,760
has

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,279
then the cost of leasing your car will

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,920
not go up but as far as accessibility

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
goes

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,120
some of those animated elements can

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
actually be an issue for people with

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,680
photosensitive epilepsy

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,079
and the title of the the title of the

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,560
page is basically done in word art

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,399
that doesn't actually have alt text not

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
all of the pictures on the page have alt

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,120
text

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,959
it doesn't scale very well as you can

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
see and if you're trying to get around

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,600
the page

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,040
then some of the menu options are very

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,279
very difficult to get around with a

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,880
keyboard or a screen reader

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,800
and that doesn't mean that designing

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
websites like this is bad or that it's

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
something that you shouldn't

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,360
do it just means that you might have to

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
think about if you're designing

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
something that's really distinctive

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,720
you might have to sort of think about

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
ways you know how can i make this more

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
accessible

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
what's the extra effort that i need to

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,800
put in

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
now if we're looking at an example of

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,320
good design here's something that

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
probably a lot of people here use on a

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
fairly regular basis and that is

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
github and github is not perfect as far

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
as accessibility goes

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
but it's a well-designed website that

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
has a reasonable accessibility baseline

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,760
to start with if we have a look at the

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
information up there

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
you can see that it's not a sort of home

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,040
content's help

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,399
you've got the search bar and then in

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
the top bar there you've got pull

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
requests

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,800
issues marketplace and explore and

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
that's really good

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
because if you're using a screen reader

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
those are a lot of the places that you

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,560
tend to go to a lot using github so it's

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
really easy to get to them

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,399
even with that bar even with that bar on

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,200
the screen

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,519
which explains to you what type of code

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
is in this code base

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
that is information that's conveyed with

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
color but if you mouse over that you

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,279
actually get a tooltip that gives you

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,639
text

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,000
or if you navigate over that with a

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,800
screen reader you get a tooltip that

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,639
gives you text

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,120
so there's no way that they're conveying

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,519
information only using color

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,360
it's it scales fairly well the fonts are

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,079
fairly easy to read and as a matter of

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,880
fact

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,880
this is actually the repository for nvda

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
which is a free and open source screen

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,160
reader for windows

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,240
and the reason that envy access which is

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,480
the company that produces nvda

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
uses github is because they've worked

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,200
out that for their blind and visually

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,040
impaired users

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,639
it's the easiest way for them to be able

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,760
to navigate around the page

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,760
and submit issues

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
now there are a lot of resources that

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,040
you can use if you're interested in

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,120
accessible design and doing this well

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,639
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
are kind of the starting point for

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,720
anyone who wants to make sure that their

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,279
website or other software is accessible

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,199
and the accessibility project has

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
produced effectively a plain language

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,920
version of these

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
which is a bit easier to understand and

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,839
go through if you want to make sure that

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,440
your website is accessible

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
speaking of plain language and

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
intellectual and cognitive disabilities

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,519
are not something that i'm going to

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,839
touch on

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,600
very much in this talk but something

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,279
that's really good to do

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
is to have a look at the us federal

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,160
government's plain language standards

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,399
because what these

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,120
do is they explain to you if you have a

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,959
website that's very reliant on text

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
how you can phrase that text in a way

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,160
that's very easy for people with

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,639
intellectual and cognitive disabilities

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,720
to understand

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
and if you're a devops person like me or

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,040
you develop with a lot of pipelines then

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,880
you can actually automate a lot of this

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
so there's also a list of tools for

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
accessibility testing

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,240
and you can take a lot of those and you

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
can automate them straight into your ci

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519
cd pipelines

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,279
which means that you can pick off the

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
low hanging fruit and make sure that

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
they work

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,079
which will take a lot of the workload

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,600
off of your qa's

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,079
now christy veers is a blind person who

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,040
produced a video explaining how she

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,560
uses the iphone's accessibility features

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,000
and this is something that i recommend

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,800
that everyone who's interested in

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,320
accessibility should watch

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,000
not because it's a great resource on how

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
to do it but because it shows you what's

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
possible

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,040
when you really think about and design

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,160
things with accessibility in mind i mean

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,800
the iphone has a braille keyboard it has

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,120
a great number of features in terms of

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
voice activation and in terms of being

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
able to

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,480
use your phone if you're blind or

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,240
visually impaired in a way that a lot of

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
us wouldn't think about but

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,880
they've done that because they've

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
designed it with the needs of blind

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,320
users in mind so i absolutely recommend

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,759
checking that out now colorblindness is

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,639
a really common accessibility

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,399
requirement about

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,160
five percent of the population mostly

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,160
men are colorblind

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,120
and one tool that i recommend that you

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,279
use is the color oracle desktop filter

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
now there are a lot of other tools which

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,560
are sort of in browser you know add-ons

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,560
for chrome or firefox

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,920
that you can use to see what a website

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,000
is looks like

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
to someone who's color blind the reason

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,560
that i recommend color oracle over those

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
websites is because color oracle is a

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
desktop application

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
so it doesn't just have to be websites

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
like if you're developing mobile apps

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,759
or if you're developing native

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,759
applications for windows or ios

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,440
you can actually use color oracle to see

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,880
what those applications look like

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,880
for people with all different types of

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,920
color blindness

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,600
and as far as using screen readers the

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,279
patchy yellow group have put together

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
this really good list of basic

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,560
screen reader commands so that if you

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,399
need to

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,079
be able to navigate around your website

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
with a screen reader you can pull up

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
that list

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,279
and it contains commands for three of

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,399
the most common screen readers jaws nvda

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,160
and voiceover

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
and you can use that to make sure that

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
you can get around your website with a

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,480
screen

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
reader the last one that i think is

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,399
actually really important to call out is

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
the photosensitive epilepsy analysis

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,199
tool or peat

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,040
which was developed by researchers at

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,639
the university of maryland

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
the reason that's really important is

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
that photosensitive epilepsy is actually

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,079
a major health risk

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
in terms of having elements on your

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,440
websites or in your software

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,440
that can cause seizures and because it's

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
a major health risk you can't ask

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
people with photosensitive epilepsy to

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
test that so the researchers at the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,120
university of maryland have created this

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,799
completely automated tool

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,799
which will allow you to do it yourself

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,319
now the web content accessibility

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,919
guidelines are a good starting point but

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,360
one thing that's useful to bear in mind

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,360
about guidelines is that

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
they often actually don't tell the whole

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,959
story

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,959
let's look at a few of the ways that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,640
that kind of manifests

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
so there are a lot of things that

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,799
guidelines don't teach you and to start

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
with

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,520
what happens if someone has

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,280
accessibility requirements that the

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
guidelines don't cover

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
and this is one that really gets on my

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,280
goat because minimum font size on

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,559
websites is really relevant to me and

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,400
that's not in the web content

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,400
accessibility guidelines

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,760
they do specify that you should be able

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,000
to zoom websites up to 200 times but

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,600
i can tell you from experience that 200

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,760
times six point font is still

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,520
pretty small so you want to consider

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,039
if you are developing a website what

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
happens if you've got users that have

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,520
requirements that aren't in the

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
guidelines

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,960
what if different groups of people have

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,559
clashing requirements and you can look

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,240
at that in terms of visual impairments

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,520
where you'll have people whose eyes will

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
let in different amount

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,919
amounts of light you can look at that in

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,039
terms of perhaps autistic users or users

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,960
with migraines

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,120
might have different requirements to

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,160
someone who needs a light mode

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,360
and so you want to make sure when you

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,039
have different groups of people that

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,880
have clashing requirements that you have

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,480
a certain amount of customization and

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
light mode and dark mode are a really

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,320
good thing to call out here

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,559
or you can allow users to customize the

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,160
website themselves

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,559
what if you're overwriting someone's

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
local accessibility settings and

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,400
this happens depressingly frequently

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,080
that there are posts on blogs or forums

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,640
or someone calls up a call center and

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
they say

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
hey i use a high contrast mode on my

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,720
computer and i've tried to install your

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,520
desktop software and it's over right

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,799
it's overwriting my high contrast mode

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
and if someone does that you want to

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
make sure that your response is sort of

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
okay

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,720
let's get that sorted out and work with

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,480
you but the best thing that you can do

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
is to not have that issue in the first

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
place

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,919
so make sure that you test it so that

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
you know you're not overwriting

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,520
someone's local accessibility settings

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,440
what if the guidelines are misleading

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
and most often they're not going to be

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
but there were some researchers who were

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,200
interested in how

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,360
button color and contrast were affected

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,720
by color blindness and so they recruited

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,799
some colorblind folks and some

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,520
non-colorblind folks

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,840
for basically a study where they looked

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,000
at

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
blue buttons with black text on a white

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
background and blue buttons with white

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,960
text on a white background

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,919
and what they found was that sort of

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,280
mid blue buttons with the black text

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,280
even though that would meet the web

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
content accessibility guidelines

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
on a white background it was actually

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,120
harder to see than the white text which

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,160
failed the web content accessibility

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,840
guidelines contrast

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
checkers so that's something that's

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
worth calling out you also have to look

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
at

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
what if the guidelines priorities are

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
wrong for your use case

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,919
for example if you have a website with a

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,520
lot of deaf and hard of hearing users

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
you're going to want to focus on things

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,400
like sign language interpreting and

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,159
captioning audio

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,080
but if you're using a guideline that's

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,520
intended for blind users

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,200
that's going to focus on really

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
different things so you want to make

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,360
sure that if you have a particular user

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
base

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,640
you sort of have an understanding of

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,559
that

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
what if the guidelines only cover good

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
not better

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,440
and i like to talk about this generally

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,480
in terms of the 80 20 rule

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,000
because 80 of accessibility requirements

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,400
you can solve with 20

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
of the work but that other 20 will be

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
about 80

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,120
of the work and that will be when people

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,039
make those blog posts or they call in to

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,960
your call center and they say hey

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
i've got this issue so you want to make

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
sure that they have an easy way to

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
contact you

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
so that you end up being aware of those

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,280
things and you want to make sure that

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,760
you address them

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,120
now for a lot of accessibility talks

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,559
this would be the point where the person

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,480
giving the talk would explain to you how

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
to do everything right

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
this is not one of those talks and the

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,559
reason for that is that i think it's

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
often very instructive to actually look

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,679
at what people do

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,960
wrong so that you can learn from the

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,360
common mistakes that people make

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
this is atlassian confluence and i

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
imagine that a lot of the people who are

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,240
in the audience today will

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
probably have used confluence for those

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
who haven't it's basically a central

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
repository for documentation

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
across a company and a lot of big

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,120
companies use it now

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
it looks fairly logical right you've got

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,760
a test space

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
you've got some information on the left

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,159
hand side that tells you about what's

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,720
going on

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
you've got a whole lot of information in

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,080
the center that explains to you how you

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
would actually go about starting up with

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,000
this test space

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,400
you can create a page and you'll see a

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,159
dialogue like this appear and then once

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,760
you've actually created that page

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,760
the page itself looks like this

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,159
that looks fine right let's go back and

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,679
take another look at that

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,760
now as you can see even though this test

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,520
page is created in myspace which you

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,880
know because my name's up there

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,120
i wasn't actually the person that

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,039
created this this page was created by

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
someone called matthew gregory

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,400
and matt at the time that i started

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,559
doing this talk was my manager

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,880
and here's why he created that and not

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799
me because when i tried to create the

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,799
page on my zoomed in screen

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,760
the create button was cut off the bottom

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,440
of the pop-up dialog

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,000
oops so the options within the pop-up

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,400
itself

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,760
can be scrolled but because the create

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,240
button is cut off the bottom of the

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,080
screen

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,919
this basically meant that for a while

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
until atlassian fixed it

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,799
every time i wanted to create a

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,159
confluence page i had to go and get

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,840
someone to do it for me

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,120
which is not really very convenient

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,799
so how do we improve this well the first

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,919
thing that's important is to make sure

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,600
that all of your ui

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,200
elements are scrollable and that

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,440
nothing's cut off by the bottom of the

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
screen so one way that you might solve

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,799
an issue like this

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
is to set it up so that someone using a

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
zoomed in screen

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,360
can actually scroll that create dialogue

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,039
from top to bottom

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,039
you also generally want to test your

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,480
pop-up windows for accessibility

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,880
so you want to make sure that if there's

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,559
more information that you need to sort

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
of go through that pop-up window

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,159
that on a zoomed in screen it's not

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,760
being blocked out by other ui

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
elements and you want to make sure that

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
they can be navigated using adaptive

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
technology

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
so things like screen readers and people

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,120
using zoomed in screens

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,679
does it appear to them in a way where

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,840
they're still able to get around

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,080
now the best thing to do is either to

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,240
increase your screen size yourself

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
or get some users and magnified screens

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
to come in and test your application

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
because

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,600
they do it every day so they're

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,279
generally going to be able to work out

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,840
what the issues are much more readily

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,840
than you are

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,000
now i don't use screen readers so i

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,640
wasn't the person who actually

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
said i need a human screen reader this

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,960
was my friend's grandmother

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,039
who was very tech savvy but due to a

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,240
degenerative disease later on in life

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,200
she became blind now she was a person of

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
faith

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
and as she found it more difficult to

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,919
sort of get out into the world

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,159
and go to her faith community in person

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,799
she substituted that with the pathos

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,320
website

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
which bills itself as hosting the

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,760
conversation on faith

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,480
and in late 2016 when she started using

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
pathos

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
it looked something like this and this

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
is a

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
screenshot from the wayback machine and

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,760
you can see that

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,279
for visual users it's fairly easy to

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,159
sort of see what's going on and get

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
around it

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,600
and it wasn't perfect for screen readers

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
but it wasn't too bad

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,200
like you were reasonably readily able to

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,120
navigate your way around all of the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,799
menus get to pages and read what was

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,640
going on on them

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,960
then in sort of late 2017 early 2018

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,240
patheos went through a redesign and

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,760
after the redesign

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
the page looked like this now the issues

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
with this page aren't immediately

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
obvious

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
but the only reason for that is because

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
the pop-up advertisements and

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,640
auto-playing videos that patheos added

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,480
to their website are so obnoxious that

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,600
modern browsers actually block them on

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,200
site

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,360
you see that text up there that says

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,360
advertisement i wasn't using an ad

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,039
blocker when i took this

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,400
safari thought that the web the

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,760
advertisement on the website was so

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,320
obnoxious that it just blocked it

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,000
and one of the things with auto playing

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
videos is if you're using a screen

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
reader they actually talk over the

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,159
screen reader

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,760
and that made my friend's grandmother

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,120
feel something like this she didn't

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,720
really want to be at her computer

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,159
anymore she didn't really want to use

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,919
pathos she was very frustrated about it

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,840
now if you want to look at an example

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,600
closer to home in terms of

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,120
how doing this well can really help

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,679
people coles

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,039
the retailer actually got sued by a

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,240
screen reader user

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,320
because they redesigned their website

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,400
and she went from being able to place an

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,880
audit on calls online using her screen

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,600
reader

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
to not being able to do it now coles

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
actually

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
settled that case and part of the

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
settlement was that they committed to

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,400
making sure

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,320
that their website was accessible to

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
screen reader users and met the web

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,640
content accessibility guidelines

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,480
so now if you want to look at a good

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,080
example of how to do accessibility

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
cause is one and that's because they

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,200
know they've got to do it

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,600
oops so the sound on autoplaying videos

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
does

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,120
actually talk over screen readers but

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
part of the problem is that

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,600
if you can't see the video on the page

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,000
it can be really hard to close it

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,240
because pop-up advertisements will often

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,919
take screen readers to a new page

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,600
and that makes websites very hard to

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,840
navigate because if you're using a

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,039
screen reader and you don't expect that

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,880
you'll be looking for

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,880
anchors that will kind of tell you where

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,640
you need to go and you may not actually

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
be able to find them

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,000
the worst bit about it and this holds

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
for both pop-up advertisements and

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,840
videos

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
is that often they dismiss trigger or

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,679
their clothes or their little

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,320
x actually isn't visible to the screen

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
reader or keyboard navigation user

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,279
and that means that you can't close it

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
at all and sometimes you have to just

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,480
reload the page

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,640
now apple does accessibility very well

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,919
and safari has this really cool feature

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,919
called reader mode

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
and what you can do is for any website

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,159
you can turn that on

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,880
and you can get just text and pictures

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,679
nothing else

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,720
no pop-up ads no auto-playing videos the

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
thing with that though

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,480
is that in order to do that you have to

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,640
be using well-formed html

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,240
which the pathos designers weren't and

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,520
so that meant that reader mode which was

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,520
something that my friend's grandmother

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,799
often used as an alternative option

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,240
didn't work for her either so how do we

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
improve it

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,880
well it probably seems obvious but let

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,799
users decide whether they want to play

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,960
videos instead of auto playing them

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,640
it makes everyone's life so much easier

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,399
it's really just good design

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,320
and it's especially important because

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,480
those auto playing videos will talk over

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,240
screen reader users

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
another thing that's really good to do

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
is to make sure that if you do have to

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,640
have pop-up elements or pop-up

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,600
advertisements or auto-playing videos

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,600
there's a clear dismiss or close trigger

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,600
and it's easy for a keyboard navigation

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,080
user or screen reader to actually get to

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
that

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,360
because then it means that they can get

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,279
rid of it and they can go about doing

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,679
what they wanted to do

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,279
now it's always a good idea to check to

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,279
see whether reader mode works on your

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,720
website for safari users

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,799
you can do that just by going to the

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
website and seeing in the address bar

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,000
there will be a link that will say

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
load this in reader mode if that's

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
grayed out then it means that your html

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,520
needs to be properly formed

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,960
before the site will be viewable using

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,120
reader mode

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
and the best thing to do is put on a

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,720
blindfold cover your screen

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,760
and use a screen reader yourself you'll

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,679
learn very quickly

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,760
that it's actually quite difficult to do

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,520
but not only will it help you build

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,120
empathy but if you compare what the

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,440
screen reader shows you

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,880
to what you actually see visually you'll

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,480
quite quickly pick up a lot of those

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,799
issues that screen reader users will

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
face

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,159
does anyone here remember geocities now

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,919
obviously there's an audience response

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,440
today but i'm willing to bet that some

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,039
of you have been around for long enough

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
that you do remember it

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,679
for those who don't websites that were

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,760
created with geocities tended to look

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,399
something like this i mean it's very 90s

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,039
isn't it

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,000
that penguins animated the colors are

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,600
pretty clashing

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
i mean it would probably make more sense

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,520
if you spoke tai but

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,679
there's a lot of word art a lot of fonts

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,600
that aren't particularly intuitive and

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,880
a lot of geocities was really like that

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,559
the only thing that's missing is the

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,240
giant scrolling rainbow bar at the top

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,200
of the screen

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,080
now geocities is actually dead yahoo

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
killed it off i believe in march of

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,399
2019.

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
unfortunately now there are a lot of

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,000
folks in the design world who are around

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
in the day of geocities

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
and some of them have taken some of

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,559
these elements and actually incorporated

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,559
them into their corporate websites

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,559
one of my friends who has photosensitive

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,159
epilepsy actually had a really

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,080
interesting run-in with one of these

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
designers who had decided that when he

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360
was going to redesign

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
his company's corporate website that

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,320
they were going to have a giant strobing

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,320
pink element

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,399
that covered about the top two-thirds of

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
the screen

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,880
which is basically the equivalent of

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,039
taking your fancy corporate website

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
we are very amazing and we will show you

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,640
why

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,159
and putting in yancat on it which is

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,960
probably not something that i'd

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,840
recommend doing for business

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,399
now my friend who works in the it

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
industry

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
had heard about this company and she was

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,159
very interested to find out what they

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,919
did

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,840
so she went to their corporate website

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,919
to check it out and because there was a

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,640
giant strobing pink element on the front

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,840
page

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,440
she had a seizure and that resulted in a

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,279
phone call that i suspect that the

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,960
designer probably didn't want to have

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,000
oops so flashing flickering and strobing

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,000
effects are a pretty

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
major cause of seizures for people with

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,159
photosensitive epilepsy

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,559
and one of the reasons why this website

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,519
was such an issue is that saturated reds

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,120
and pinks

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,919
which are at one end of the wavelength

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,760
spectrum are much more likely to trigger

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,880
seizures for folks with photosensitive

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,480
epilepsy

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,480
the other thing that's an issue is high

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
contrast effects so if you have say

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,159
bright red flashing to white

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,080
that's going to be much more likely to

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,200
cause a seizure than dark blue flashing

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,880
to dark green

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,600
because there's a lot less contrast

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,840
there photosensitive epilepsy is

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
though a spectrum from mild to severe

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,360
and so some folks like my friend

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
who on the more severe end of that

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,720
spectrum will tend to have to deal with

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
those issues more frequently

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,760
so it's a really good thing to try and

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,799
make sure

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,399
that you do design with this in mind

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,399
so how do we improve it then well

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,919
you should probably avoid using flashing

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,440
flickering and strobing effects if you

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,360
possibly can because

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,960
not only can they trigger photosensitive

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,480
epilepsy but they can also be a

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,919
distraction for folks with things like

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,600
adhd

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,200
if you look at a lot of the back of a

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,960
lot of video game cases

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,279
they will actually have warnings on them

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,960
that say there are flashing flickering

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
and strobing effects in this game and it

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
may trigger photosensitive epilepsy

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,039
and that's why those warnings are there

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,039
so as well as warning people

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,720
if you do need to use those kinds of

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,320
effects you want to make sure that

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,240
they're as small as possible and as low

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
contrast as you can possibly get them

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,080
so some dark blue flashing to dark green

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,799
in a corner is not going to be as much

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,559
of an issue

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,480
than the big pink strobe at the top of

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,799
the corporate website

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,880
and again you do want to avoid using

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,760
saturated reds and pinks if you possibly

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,799
can

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,960
now if your website does absolutely need

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,880
to have flashing effects or animations

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,559
one thing that you can do is to give

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,760
users the option to disable them

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,760
because that means that folks with

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,960
things like photosensitive epilepsy or

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,720
adhd

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,720
still have the option to experience the

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,760
website even if it's not necessarily in

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,760
the way that you intended

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,720
now there is actually a certain amount

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,799
of precedent for disabled people being

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,799
involved in integrated sports

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,320
and that can be everything from kids

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,320
playing in the schoolyard

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,640
all the way up to olympic medalists like

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,760
reiter ildiko the hungarian fencer

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,840
and m donghyun the korean archer

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
now in the modern day obviously as

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,960
technology has become more of a thing

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,640
sports have evolved

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,799
and one thing that's come out of that is

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,840
esports and this case study that we're

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,679
going to look at

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
specifically looks at league of legends

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
esports

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,799
now for those of you who aren't familiar

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,919
with league of legends

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,919
it's kind of akin to a video game sort

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,760
of catch of the flags you have teams of

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,720
five that are aiming to defeat an enemy

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,360
base

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,279
and every person on that team of five is

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,480
able to pick their own character

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,480
or champion with special abilities

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,600
and for the purposes of this case study

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,760
we are talking about

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,640
tom kench who is a champion in league of

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,720
legends and is the titular catfish

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,240
and when he was introduced to the game

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
he had a mechanic that no other

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
character had

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,519
called grey health what you would

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
usually see is that those health bars up

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,159
there

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,080
would have dark red and dark gr or

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,840
bright red and bright green to the left

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,440
and then a very faded red and faded

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,679
green to the what to the right

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,360
to indicate health that had been lost

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,800
but in tom cansha's case you can see

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,720
that there's a big chunk of the health

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,960
bar that's gray

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,639
that's because that indicates the great

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
health which is a shield that tom kench

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,000
puts up so at this point he's

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,520
effectively unkillable

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
and this is where we find out how many

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
colorblind people are in the audience

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,839
today

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
because we're going to put a colorblind

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,079
filter over that

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
and what we find is that's not actually

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,639
so clear

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,639
it's very difficult to tell the

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,440
difference between

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
the gray health and that faded red and

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,919
faded green

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,599
that indicates health that the character

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,800
has lost now

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,639
you might not think that there are that

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,440
many colorblind people who play video

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,919
games

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
on the contrary tom kent actually

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,440
resulted

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,919
in a tweet from a professional player

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,919
saying

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,760
if you didn't know i'm colorblind along

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,359
with two other members of my team

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,280
and all three of us can't see what

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,720
health he's at in colorblind mode

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
the reason that the professional player

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
put this tweet out was because him and

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,640
his team

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,320
effectively couldn't play when tom kench

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,599
was on the battlefield which meant that

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,960
they were unable to do their jobs

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,400
oops so to their credit

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,160
riot games the owners of league of

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,160
legends did actually rectify this

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,599
situation fairly quickly after it was

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,480
brought to their attention

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,920
but what's worth noting here is that as

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,599
you can see from the screenshots

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,440
most colorblind people can't tell the

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,680
difference between red and green

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,040
and if they can't see a color that color

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,640
is going to look very much

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,400
gray or black to them now

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,560
colorblind people will generally use

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,040
contrast to tell the difference between

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,280
color

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
colors that they can't see but one thing

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,240
that you have to bear in mind is that

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,760
even in a colorblind mode

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,280
not all of the colors will necessarily

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,880
be clear to people

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,560
and if you are developing a colorblind

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,079
mode where you're using icons

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,880
those icons should definitely be

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,880
unambiguous

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,280
so how do we improve it well first of

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,200
all you want to use a contrast checker

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
to ensure the elements will be viewable

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,560
by colorblind people

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,640
you can use a contrast checker you can

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,480
also use something like color oracle put

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,359
colorblindness filters over it

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
or get colorblind people to test it even

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,839
pardon me

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,280
even if you do have a colorblind mode

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,880
because then it will make it much easier

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,560
to work out where the issues might

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,040
actually be

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,839
now it's not just red or green color

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
blindness

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,880
there is actually blue color blindness

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
or tritonopia

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,000
and there's also a chromatopsia which is

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,240
a complete lack of color

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,359
vision and when you're designing

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,040
although they're a much smaller

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,880
percentage of the population

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,560
it is still good practice to make sure

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,320
that you design modes for them

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,079
slack the messaging app that probably a

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,560
lot of people here use as well

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,160
does this really well if you go in and

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,960
you have a look at their accessibility

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,800
settings

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,880
you can actually see that there's not

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,800
only a theme for protonopia and

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,680
deuteronopia which are red and green

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,760
color blindness

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,839
there's also one for tritonopia which is

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,359
blue colorblindness

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,040
then if you do end up setting up a

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,640
colorblind mode and this is obviously

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,359
not as applicable to things like league

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,119
of legends

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
but if you do you want to make sure that

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,800
you're using meaningful icons to

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,800
indicate different elements and states

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,960
so it's going to be much more useful if

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,599
you have say a star or a heart a

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,200
lightning bolt and a bright pink rose

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,200
than it is if you have a square a

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,160
rounded rectangle and a circle which are

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,160
fairly ambiguous

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,160
now 2020 has been a bit of an

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
interesting year

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,400
we've had a lot of upheaval in the world

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,000
and even here in australia

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,079
we've had a couple of fairly major

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,880
disasters earlier in the year we had the

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,640
bushfires

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
and at the moment we've got the covert

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,160
19 pandemic

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,599
one thing that that's raised awareness

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,640
of as we have

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,240
our prime minister and the premiers and

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,640
the premiers and chief ministers of each

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,200
state often doing press conferences

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,640
is sign language interpreters who when

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,400
these folks are on television

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
will often be standing next to them

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,720
interpreting what they're saying

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,160
the reason for that is so that deaf and

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,760
hard of hearing people

00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,440
are able to actually absorb that

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,440
information for people whose first

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,800
language is australian sign language

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,359
so that they don't have to go elsewhere

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,680
to get it in an emergency

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,400
now sign language interpreting is

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,240
important

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,480
but it's not the only way to make that

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,480
information accessible to everyone

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,000
another way to do that is by live

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,000
captioning things

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,760
and there's a lot of automated software

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,440
out there that does that

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,960
a lot of folks think that automated

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,880
software is a solution for their

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,280
podcasts or what have you

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,800
but that's not always the case let's

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,040
take a look at this tweet from cal

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,240
montgomery a disability rights activist

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,599
in the us

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,000
who's writing about a national

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,400
disability organization

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
he says if you value us equally and want

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,839
us to participate fully

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,839
we need full access to the pulsate

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
briefing with enough lead time to absorb

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,800
it

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,480
that chance is gone for this year which

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,839
means that you have just sabotaged your

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,040
own legislative agenda

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,040
by leaving advocates unprepared now

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,480
the reason that cal put out this tweet

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,000
was that the national disability

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,359
advocacy organization

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,560
of which he was a member had produced

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,320
a briefing where the only text the only

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,320
text that was provided to support it

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,160
was automated captioning and if you're

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,760
wondering where pulsate comes from

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,960
that's what the automated captioning

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,400
software rendered policy as

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,240
the podcast this american life also uses

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,839
automated captioning software to help

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,520
them with producing transcriptions of

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,599
their podcasts

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,000
but rather than just put it up they then

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,079
have a human transcriber review it to

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
make sure that it's accurate

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,280
they do have a notation on their website

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,960
that says that

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,800
this american life is produced for the

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
ear and designed to be heard

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
but if you're deaf or hard of hearing or

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,920
otherwise text reliant

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,599
you're still able to consume this

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,440
american life through looking at the

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,599
transcript which has been corrected by a

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,680
human transcriber

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,760
the abc is another organization that

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,920
generally does transcripts really well

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,760
for a lot of their radio and television

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
they will actually provide either closed

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,280
captions at the bottom of the video

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
or a text transcript that people can

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
read out later

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,359
with that said even they're not perfect

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
because if we look at this

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,599
if we look at this radio national

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,040
breakfast show from the 24th of august

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,800
where we could see the transcript button

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,280
on the previous slide there's actually

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,480
no transcript here for this at all

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,160
however at least the abc makes an effort

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,240
one of the other major producers of

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,800
podcasts in australia

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,480
are the australian guardian now the

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
australian guardian produced

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
a number of podcasts including one about

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
australian politics weekly

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
which is a really good source of news

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,280
about both the bushfires and the covert

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,520
19 pandemic

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,280
unfortunately the guardian strategy

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,119
about transcribing their podcast

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,440
is not to do it at all as we can see

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,560
from this headline guardian podcasts

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,200
why no transcripts yeah i'm going to be

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,119
honest

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,960
that's probably not ideal if you want

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,960
people to be able to access your news

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,400
oops and one important thing to note

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,240
here

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,319
is that text reliant people aren't

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,160
necessarily deaf or hard of hearing

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,359
autistic folks people with sensory

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,040
processing disorders

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,720
people with things like migraines or

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,040
tinnitus where they might not always be

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,839
able to understand or parse or even

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,079
stand

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,000
listening to someone talking will tend

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,480
to be text reliant at least some

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,520
all of the time so if you transcribe

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,280
things properly

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,680
then you're opening up your audio and

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,440
video content to a much wider audience

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,880
whereas if you don't there's actually

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,240
quite a number of people who are

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,520
completely unable to access it

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,000
so how do we improve it well you want to

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,000
provide

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,359
transcripts for any spoken audio that

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,960
you have on your website

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,720
and that means that anyone who's text

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
reliant will be able to go on your

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
website

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,319
rather than trying to listen to

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,359
something that they may not be able to

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,480
hear

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,160
they can just read through the

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,359
transcript and they can get information

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,599
about what's going on

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,359
the same holds for videos one thing that

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,880
you'll notice that i've done here is

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,200
that below the slides

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,359
there's a little black box that in it

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
has captions that explain what i'm

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,520
saying

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,040
and that means that if there are deaf or

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
hard of hearing or otherwise text

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,240
reliant folks who are listening to this

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,079
talk at the moment

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,240
then they don't have to listen to what

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,160
i'm saying or try to lip read me

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,079
they can just read the captions and they

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,800
know what i'm saying

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,599
now captions and transcriptions

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,000
shouldn't just

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,280
explain what or shouldn't just lay out

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
what someone is saying

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,560
they should also explain things like

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,000
background noise like there might be

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,800
cars honking in the background of a

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
video

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,800
or they should explain changes in vocal

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
tone if you look at transcriptions and

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
captions that are produced by things

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,119
like netflix

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
for movies you'll often see that they'll

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,680
actually say that someone is speaking

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,160
angrily or brightly or happily

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,920
and automated transcription software is

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,200
not a bad place to start but it's not a

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,560
complete solution

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,480
you should always make sure that if

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,240
you're using automated transcription

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,160
software or captioning software

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,400
that you have a human review and correct

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,079
that transcription before it's published

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,839
otherwise you end up with things like

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,040
the pulsate briefing which leaves folks

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,839
like kel montgomery

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,839
out in the cold

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,800
hacking an artificial pancreas now

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,480
you can kind of read that in two

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
different ways because we could be

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,599
talking about hacking together an

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,200
artificial pancreas

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,960
or we could be talking about hacking

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,480
into one in fact

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,880
this case study actually covers both

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,400
this up here is a medtronic mini-med

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
insulin pump

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,079
basically diabetic people can hook

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,839
themselves up to these

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,760
so that rather than having to regularly

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,680
inject themselves with insulin

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,280
they can have the insulin pump do it for

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,200
them it's much more akin to what the

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,160
pancreas which is the organ that doesn't

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,960
function properly

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,119
people with diabetes will generally do

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,200
in healthy people

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,440
now the minimum insulin pump in this

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,040
picture actually had a really major

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,599
security flaw in it

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,800
and that was interesting because one

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
thing that happened was

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,040
that a lot of diabetic people started

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,640
hunting down these obsolete insulin

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,240
pumps despite the fact that they had a

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,280
security floor

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,359
the reason for that was that these

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,319
mini-med insulin pumps could communicate

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,839
with a remote

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,599
that someone could use to deliver

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,400
insulin to themselves

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,480
via a very common radio frequency what a

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,079
couple of people had actually worked out

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,520
was that if you could get a constant

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,440
blood glucose monitor

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,200
which is implanted under the skin and

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,560
delivers information using that same

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,000
radio frequency

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,760
you could hook the two of them up

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,040
together and effectively create an

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,200
artificial pancreas

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,720
so that as your blood sugar fluctuated

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,240
the mini-made insulin pump

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,560
would deliver appropriate amounts of

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,560
insulin now that was great

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,760
it was a security flaw that someone was

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,319
able to exploit

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,839
to benefit a large number of people

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,760
unfortunately there were also some

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,920
unintended consequences of that

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,680
because obviously anything that has a

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,720
security flaw like these medtronic

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,240
insulin pumps

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,319
is vulnerable to hacker attacks now

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,240
the fda which is the sort of

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,960
organization in the us that regulates

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,880
medtronic

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,079
didn't really take this too seriously

00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,839
for a while i mean

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,599
they issued an alert on medtronic

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,400
insulin pump security so that people

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,079
were aware

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,319
but they didn't really make the time to

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,200
see what might actually happen

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,119
if someone was able to exploit this

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,640
there were a few scientists who weren't

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,160
particularly impressed at that

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,480
and so they decided that they were going

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,200
to have a go at exploiting it themselves

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,160
which led to this headline these hackers

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
made an app that kills to prove a point

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,440
because what the ethical hackers had

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,000
worked out

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,760
was that not only could these mini-med

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,880
insulin pumps communicate with blood

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,720
glucose monitors

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,319
they could also communicate with any

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,280
smartphone and with a little bit of

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,319
hacking

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,200
a lot of tv remotes which is not

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,319
really terribly ideal and so what these

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,079
hackers had done

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,599
was they had produced an android app

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,000
that anyone could install on their

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,079
android

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,680
phone which would hook up to that really

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,400
common radio frequency

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,960
and deliver a lethal dose of insulin to

00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,800
any user of a mini-med insulin pump in

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,520
the vicinity

00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,440
which finally prompted medtronic through

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,640
the fda to recall their vulnerable

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,000
mini-med insulin pumps

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,079
oh dear now

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
when you're developing medical devices

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,319
or health

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,000
applications in general accessibility

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,400
issues aren't just about design

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,079
often then security issues can actually

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,319
be an accessibility issue

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,160
because they can potentially render the

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,040
device or the application completely

00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,280
useless

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,880
or in the worst case potentially be used

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
to kill people

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,240
and it's a really important thing to

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,400
consider when you develop those kinds of

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,000
health applications and medical devices

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,160
people are giving you a lot of private

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,200
information and you do often hold

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,720
lives in your hands the issue with that

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,920
is that if you're regulated by an

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,160
external organization

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,400
like the fda they may not actually tell

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,720
you about those kinds of issues quickly

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,319
or even necessarily at all so you need

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,000
to make sure that you're across it so

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,480
that you don't end up being on the back

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,920
foot

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,880
if something happens like it did with

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,839
the mini-med insulin pumps

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,280
so how do we improve it well the first

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,599
thing to do i mean

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,880
really just sort of institute good

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,319
security principles

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,920
and the first thing to do there is you

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,480
want to consider the possible attack

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,560
vectors

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,160
so i'm building a health app or i'm

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,440
building a medical device

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,720
how might a black hat person or someone

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,480
who wants to hack this to get

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,359
information or to hurt people

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,119
try to exploit that then you want to

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,480
conduct penetration testing and you

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,160
generally want to do that

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,760
before your device or application goes

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,079
to market so you get in

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,839
skilled security professionals who you

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,359
pay and they will basically try to

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,960
attack that device for you

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,520
and then give you a list of findings so

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,520
that you can remediate them

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,520
if people do make you aware of security

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,040
vulnerabilities then it's a good idea to

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
respond promptly to them

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,400
not only will you show people that

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,319
you're serious but you'll potentially

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,079
not be opening yourself up to liability

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,760
later down the line

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,839
the really sad thing about this case

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,400
study is actually that unintended uses

00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,480
can often be a business opportunity

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,319
if medtronic had been aware of people

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,599
using these mini-med insulin pumps to

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,960
hook this up

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,440
and they had decided that they were

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,440
going to try and produce a device that

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,200
was a continuous blood glucose monitor

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,040
hooked up to an insulin pump

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,559
that would have opened this up to a huge

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,319
number of people who didn't have the

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,200
technical know-how to hack it together

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,400
themselves

00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,319
and it would have been a great business

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,559
opportunity for them

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,559
as i speak it's been i think about six

00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,920
years since these mini-med insulin pumps

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,559
were recalled

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,839
and medtronic are still working on a

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,760
device that does that

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,839
as far as i'm aware it hasn't yet come

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,359
to market hopefully it does at some

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,680
point because i think it will be much

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,599
more beneficial to a lot of people

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,200
and hopefully much more secure than the

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,079
artificial pancreas that people hack

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,079
together themselves

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,800
now i've been giving this talk for

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,960
probably about eight or nine months now

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,920
and one thing that happened with this

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,319
even though

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,119
i use a walking stick is i became much

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,880
more interested

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,960
not just in my own accessibility

00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,680
requirements but in accessibility in

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
general

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,280
and so i've tried to sort of keep an eye

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,720
on what's going on in that world

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,480
so that if i learn things i can

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,400
integrate them into my accidental

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,160
accessibility advocacy

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,160
one way that i've done that is through

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,760
my linkedin feed

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,760
and so one day i was scrolling through

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,680
my linkedin feed having a look at

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,960
all the things that people had to say

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,960
and a post popped up

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,800
saying hey if you want to hear an

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,760
accessibility advocate come and give a

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,440
talk about

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,599
designing accessible or if you want to

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,119
hear an accessibility consultant rather

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,440
come and give a talk about designing

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,240
accessible websites it's on this date at

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,119
this time

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,440
and i thought great cool i know some

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,119
things about accessibility

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,720
oh obviously a lot more about the things

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,559
that are applicable to me but

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,240
i can't know everything so i'm going to

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,200
go along and listen to this person

00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,559
because most more likely than not i'm

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,359
going to learn something that i didn't

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,640
know

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,440
so i take myself off work at 4 30 i get

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,480
on the train

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,480
i show up to the venue

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,160
to see this i'm just going to let that

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,480
sink in for a minute

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,559
now the real kicker here was that it

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,720
wasn't just that one set of stairs

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,720
past the glass doors there were actually

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,559
three sets of stairs in total

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,240
that i had to stagger up to get to the

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,720
lift that would then take me to level

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,040
one

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,880
where the event was being held so i

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,640
managed to stagger my way up there and

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,240
before the talk started i thought

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,160
all right let's see what's going on

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,440
around here are there any accessible

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,920
bathrooms

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,680
so i explored the whole building and not

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,440
only did i find that there were no

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,559
accessible bathrooms in the building

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,760
at all the regular bathrooms were down

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,359
the fire escape

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,280
which was another three flights of

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,040
stairs

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,400
not ideal um i described it later to

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,720
people as being like

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,559
a roomba sitting in front of a set of

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,599
stairs that it knows it can't get up and

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,359
just repeatedly shouting error 406

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,800
which for folks who are not well versed

00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,319
in html error codes

00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,319
means not acceptable

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,920
i don't really think that i need to

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,520
explain the irony of this situation

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,960
i did listen to the talk and at the end

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,720
of the talk i actually asked the

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,040
accessibility consultant

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,119
does it strike you as ironic that you're

00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,400
giving a talk about accessibility in an

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,160
inaccessible building

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,760
and that i had to take my walking stick

00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,680
and stagger up three flights of stairs

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,800
to be able to hear you talk

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,960
and it hadn't even occurred to him and i

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,480
think that that is really interesting

00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,880
when you talk about making things

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,800
accessible to people

00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,319
so i probably don't really need to

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,119
explain to you what the issue is but

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,400
let's do the post-mortem anyway

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,720
the first thing that you want to do to

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,000
improve this is and it's quite obvious

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,440
to make sure that your venues are

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,040
wheelchair accessible and that they do

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,200
have disabled bathrooms

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,920
because if that's not the case disabled

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,440
folks just aren't going to show up

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,359
one thing that you can do which is sort

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,040
of more advanced is to provide things

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,040
like quiet spaces for

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,200
autistic folks or people with migraines

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,599
and also to provide adaptive technology

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,119
like sign language interpreters hearing

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,720
loops which are another thing that a lot

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,559
of deaf and hard of hearing people will

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,119
use you can hook your hearing aid up to

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,800
it

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,400
and then it means it filters out a lot

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,480
of the background noise

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,160
and for blind or vision impaired folks

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,800
you can have audio descriptions of

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
slides

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,839
one thing that you would notice that

00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,920
i've been doing as i've been speaking

00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,040
is i've tried to where i've had slides

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,400
that have images

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,079
describe what's going on now

00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,680
another thing that's important here is

00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,839
that you want to include people with

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,280
disabilities in these discussions about

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,960
accessibility

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,040
because you might find that there aren't

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,200
a lot of people with disabilities around

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,880
and at that point you've really got to

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,079
ask yourself who's not in the room and

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,240
why aren't they here

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,680
because once you can build that empathy

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,599
and you can start getting disabled

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,000
people involved with what you're doing

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,880
then it will make it much easier to

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,760
actually get their input on things

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,480
so to recap accessibility benefits

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,880
everyone

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,559
not just disabled people one quote that

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,079
someone gave me while i was doing this

00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,440
that i really liked was

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,760
the screen readers are great if you're

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,359
blind but they're also great if you've

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,280
got two toddlers and you just want to be

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,559
able to read a book

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,960
and when you're designing things

00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,720
accessibly building accessibility into

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,720
your design principles from the start is

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,400
the way you really want to do it

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,319
and if you're designing things like

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,559
medical devices or health apps

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,559
that's not just going to be about design

00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,880
other issues like security risks can

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,480
also potentially be accessibility issues

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,800
for you there

00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,079
now i would always recommend if you can

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,160
getting adaptive technology

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,319
users to test your software but if you

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,839
can't when you're doing testing

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,400
think about the things that disabled

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,319
people might need to do differently

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,680
if there's one takeaway that i want you

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,280
to take from this talk

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,800
it's that you need to listen to your

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,800
users because

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,559
we will always know what's best for us

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
and we can give you that feedback and

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,200
help you act on it

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,200
there are a few thanks due to melissa

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,800
who produced the fancy corporate website

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,480
to matt for taking the screenshots of

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,480
confluence that i couldn't get

00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,520
and to my friend annie who produced the

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,599
great accessibility roomba

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,559
there is i believe now some time to take

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,480
questions

00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,000
if there's any questions that you think

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,640
of that you would like me to answer

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,319
later

00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,720
there's a website and an email address

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,599
up there i do hope that all of you have

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,280
learned something

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,200
and i hope that if you ever have to get

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,640
into accessibility advocacy it's going

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:25,839
to be a bit like it's going to be a bit

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:25,839
less accidental than mine was

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,119
thank you so much dawn that was great

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,040
and i know that uh twitter has been
