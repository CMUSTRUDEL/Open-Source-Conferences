This talk is simply one about my experience of learning C from a python background
  - what python features helped me understand C better (control flow, algorithm and problem breakdown design, functions, etc)
  - what C features helped me understand python better (ie pointers in C helped me understand python lists, etc)
  - how I use my python knowledge to teach C at University
