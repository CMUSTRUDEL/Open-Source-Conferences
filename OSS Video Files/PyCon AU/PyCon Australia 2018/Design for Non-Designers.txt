so even if you consider yourself not a

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,389
designer you'll still be placed in

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,960
situations where you have to do some

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,210
design

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,250
fortunately Tracy Osborne is a designer

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,480
and developer as well as author of hello

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,160
web books she's going to take us through

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,690
the basics of visual and user experience

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,650
design please make Tracy feel welcome

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:29,279
[Applause]

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,660
hello

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,340
so as mentioned I am Tracy I am lime

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,460
tearing on the internet so you can find

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,960
me on Twitter on macedon on speaker deck

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,800
which is where I'm a publisher slides

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,969
afterwards and so ya don't need to take

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,530
notes I'm how to throw a lot of

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,180
resources at you during this

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,289
presentation so you can find these

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,840
slides and those places afterwards you

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,899
might know me from my books hello web

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,940
app is my my book teaching without

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,000
development using Django and I have some

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,580
with me anyone who's bought my books

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,670
it's really expensive to ship from

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,310
Canada to here so I just I just brought

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,420
a whole bunch to save everyone on

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,420
shipping so in case you're interested

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:22,280
more relevant for this presentation is

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:24,689
my hello web design books which I

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,670
originally did this presentation and I

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,350
gave it a bunch of conferences wrote the

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,430
book after doing this presentation and

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,770
now I'm doing the presentation again

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,729
with updated resources and whatnot so

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,829
it's been pretty fun fYI I came here

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,900
from Canada after 20 hours of flying at

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,329
7 a.m. this morning so if I act a little

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,600
more loopy than normal it's a little bit

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,340
loopiness as normal for me but I'm gonna

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,479
be on the extreme end for this

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,549
presentation have patience okay so what

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,500
do I mean by design design is kind of a

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,299
huge gigantic field this is like me

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,950
going to a design conference and doing a

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,810
half an hour presentation and saying

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,280
programming for non-programmers

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,250
half an hour so I'm what I mean by

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,640
design I just mean in general making a

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,290
design that works well very broad I'm

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
not going to go really into a lot of

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,360
nitpicky

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
things but hopefully at the end of this

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,500
30-minute session you'll pick up just

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,090
enough to get you comfortable with

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,170
Sarnia work on design and sorry to do

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,000
design and why should you know a bit

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,260
about design because even if you're a

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,300
programmer you're probably already doing

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,500
open source projects and for those open

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,310
source projects or you need a home page

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,870
you know maybe you're doing a

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,270
presentation the conference you need to

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,550
work on your slides create your personal

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,030
website this is my own it says my

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,190
husband's who's also programmer you're a

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,520
Lib three hey if you know if you know

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,940
that package and Python he did that

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:58,800
anyways lupus ha I'm Mike let's get

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,180
started let's talk about clutter now

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
there's only one thing I want you to

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,120
take back take away from this

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,190
presentation in terms of becoming a

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,160
better visual designer I want you to

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,750
think about clutter and what you can do

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
whenever you're working on design it's

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,520
just reducing clutter your designs ago

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,100
make you a better better designer and

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,000
help you do better designs and by

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,980
clutter I love the show this I remember

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,440
this like different fonts and different

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,940
colors and images and alignments and

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,280
there's boxes and the boxes are all

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:34,800
different colors and it is insane the

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,160
fastest way for better looking designs

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,330
is to cut down on clutter so in this

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,459
presentation I'm going to take this

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,200
little form and I'm gonna go through

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,400
some of the big design principles and

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,230
we're going to apply them to this form

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,110
and how these design principles all

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,190
relate to clutter and we're going to

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,880
improve the way this looks so we're

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,620
going to start out with grid in general

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,420
again this is a very broad strokes in

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,940
general grid is just lining things up

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:08,220
trying to to put things on a invisible

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,620
skeleton because then when things are

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,480
not like a little bit off set from other

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,930
things it's gonna lend this like

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,290
unconscious feeling of chaoticness when

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:23,310
things aren't lining up and the shortcut

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,470
here is you know embrace grid systems in

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,610
CSS proceed for account of lab or in

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,050
embrace using

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,599
Alliance if you're working on something

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,289
that doesn't have a web component and

00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:37,770
thankfully most online CSS frameworks

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:40,199
include a grid or some kind of

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,370
alignments already within them so

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,930
bootstrap foundation skeleton all have

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,099
an integrated grid system it's going to

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,569
make it super simple to just start

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,669
lining things up and making sure that

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,039
your columns at the top of your page and

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:56,879
the middle of your page all are on this

00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:00,120
invisible skeleton and of course CSS

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:05,939
grid is becoming more and more of a

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,930
thing so taking this little form you

00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,460
might notice that there's things that

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,889
are a little bit offset from other

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,669
things and we're just gonna line them up

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,279
we're just gonna even out those the

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:19,020
vertical axes that the you know the form

00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,889
is all the same with the text is all the

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,659
same with it all starts on the same left

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:31,229
line invisible line next principle we're

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,839
gonna cover is color again as all these

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,190
things are again very very broad strokes

00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,449
I'm gonna give you a couple shortcuts

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,919
just get you started because we're not

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,229
going to go into color theory cuz no one

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,379
wants to do that

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:45,839
so in general some really good rules of

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,490
thumb in general it's a good idea to

00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,310
keep your colors complementary and what

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,250
do I mean by that means when you have a

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,620
color wheel a color that's across the

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,150
way from another color it tends to look

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,189
really good with that color so you know

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:06,689
blues look good with orange which is why

00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:08,849
you see this everywhere and in TV Tropes

00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:10,949
in orange with contrast these colors

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,560
tend to look good together so when

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,029
you're working on colors for a project

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,270
that's kind of a nice thing to just

00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:22,740
start out with when you're just starting

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:26,219
out and I like to use in general

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,629
neutrals with one brighter color to

00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,339
highlight important bits when we get

00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,810
into this a little bit later in this

00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,250
presentation but these are good things

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,629
that start out with of course when you

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,849
were a better designer you can break

00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:38,039
these rules you can do like super

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,719
colorful designs you can do

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,289
monochromatic designs but for new

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,610
designers

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,759
I think these are really good rules of

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:47,189
thumb and there's this great order

00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,110
article on Smashing Magazine it's a

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,270
simple why developers guide the color so

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,129
it's like color theory for developers

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,389
and I recommend this if you want to go

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:58,860
into a little bit more about color

00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,330
theory but let's not start from scratch

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,439
because creating a color palette from

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,819
scratch when you're working on design

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,249
you have to be like okay what colors I'm

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,039
going to use and just you know working

00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,249
from our brain blank palette no one does

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,259
that

00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:11,639
I don't do that I use color palette

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,969
websites and I have a background in

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,800
design so thankfully there's a lot of

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:19,699
websites out there to help you create a

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,229
color scheme this is color Dobby calm

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,830
there's material design material that I

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:27,270
Oh has a whole color tool my current

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,159
favorite is this one called color mine

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,749
that I oh and this is the kind of thing

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,419
where you can you can generate a full

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:35,039
palette or you can like lock a couple of

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,749
colors in or putting your own color and

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,959
then generate just three and it's going

00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:42,419
to create colors that look look good

00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,219
with other colors so this is where I

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,080
start this is where my books the color

00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,539
schemes for my books I always start from

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,729
this I'm using things like this color

00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:56,039
schemes for any of designs I do so going

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:59,959
back to this form we're gonna add some

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,189
colors and we're just going to you know

00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,229
colors look weird up here

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,599
it's actually like green actually I

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,029
wonder if I have flux on because I'm

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,409
from us hey I'm gonna do this really

00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:16,319
quickly because I think my flux is

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:17,569
making things weird hey that looks a

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,229
little bit weirder

00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:23,999
alright I did my best ok so yeh

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,229
projectors anyways those colors on here

00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:27,449
there's orange was a green background

00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:31,669
can't really see it but you can see it

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,669
when I put the slides up on line later I

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,120
can't hear you

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:42,079
so you're mumbling with this we're just

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,759
gonna move on alright it's a paw grafite

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:47,310
again another huge area choosing fonts

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,350
kind of suck we're gonna go with these

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,240
rule of thumbs keep your number of font

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,790
slow when you're starting out and it's a

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,830
good idea to just like stick with

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,720
just two different fonts in a design you

00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,340
know don't do that GoDaddy craziness

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,120
where we have different font Helvetica

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,920
Arial whatever everywhere and you can do

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,290
a lot with just two different fonts this

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,930
is just my resume actually two different

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,240
fonts on here using different treatments

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,860
italics upper case spacing things out

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,920
let's just two and so it looks a little

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,490
more cohesive while still looking very

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,590
designing it's in there good rule of

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,770
thumb to use fancy or display fonts

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,690
sparingly so by that I mean you might

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,690
remember this from the 90s early 2000s

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,250
lots of font websites like this now you

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,240
can use these things in a design of

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,030
course you can't you can break all these

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,080
rules but in general these kind of fonts

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,120
look cluttery

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,680
so if you're just starting out it's a

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:48,750
you know it's a good place to start on

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,370
buy click choose includes I Chi said if

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,110
my resume if you want more

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,480
differentiation in your text you can use

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,450
things like bolding and italics and

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,540
transforms rather than say choosing yet

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,490
another font to add to your design so

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,900
those are the principles but let's talk

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,820
about the shortcuts because that's you

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,470
know really we're busy we want to be

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,980
building your project not fussing over

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,260
design

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,630
so there's curated font websites out

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,220
there that help you choose make it

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,900
easier to choose a font instead of going

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,820
on to google fonts and scrolling through

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,220
whatever hundreds of fonts they have now

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,170
you can go to a website like beautiful

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,540
web type which just showcases some like

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,310
really nice google fonts and how they

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,710
play well like ones that play well with

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,240
others

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,120
type wolf also has a curated collection

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,930
of the 30s google fonts there's font

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,670
pair that just pairs two fonts together

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,170
[Music]

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,410
what is this one this is brick brick

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,940
that a oh that's wrong in the bottom but

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,680
essentially there's there's places on

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,810
the web that people have curated like

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,730
google fonts and also Typekit and all

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,260
these other font resources so when

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,430
you're just starting out with design you

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,140
know if they go through and try to pick

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,800
something from scratch you can just rely

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,530
on these curated collections so going

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,050
back to here we're going to update the

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,779
fonts a little bit it's pretty similar

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,029
but instead of

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,639
using I think that the one left is using

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,999
Arial and Helvetica and on Georgia at

00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,319
the top now it's just PT PT sans and PT

00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:21,699
Sarah which are two fonts that are

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:23,529
available on google fonts and there are

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:25,180
the same family and that's another like

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,610
a little trick I said if something has

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,050
the same name PT sans PT serif that

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:35,170
means that they are probably designed

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,790
together and they work all together next

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,389
up is whitespace and this is the

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:42,279
ultimate clutter reducer whitespace is

00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,579
the thing you can use to to reduce the

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:48,129
feeling of clutter almost instantly and

00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,959
first it can also make a website feel

00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,569
more professional luxurious and that's

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,480
why you see you know yachting websites

00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:57,670
of course it's just you know acres of

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,639
whitespace no text and this beautiful

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,740
background image if you go onto these

00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,110
curated design websites like that ones

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,699
are like top CSS designs you know take a

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,680
random screenshot of course all of them

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,899
have just a core is a white space it's a

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,899
very very trendy thing to do to make

00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,850
your design feel more modern we don't

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,339
have to just use acres of white space

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,189
when you're trying to use white space

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:25,750
this is the New York Times homepage

00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:27,670
redesign and the before what they did it

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,170
between this before and after not only

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,000
did they one things they did was they

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,600
reduced number of colors in the sign it

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,750
took away those blue those um the blue

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,180
links made them black but they added

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,629
just a little bit more space in the

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,100
columns and by adding space in the

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,370
columns and kind of lining up on the

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,649
vertical they had like little borders in

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,839
between the columns just a little bit of

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,189
space made a big difference in the

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,350
design they reduce the clutter just

00:12:54,189 --> 00:13:00,970
enough it's not just a trend whitespace

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,160
can also make your website your design

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,769
easier to use because it's gonna be

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,569
easier for people to see and do what you

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:11,740
want them to do so in this example what

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:15,309
they did between the left and the right

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,290
is that they took this this form excuse

00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,110
me this table they added more vertical

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,550
space in between the table contents and

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,260
they Kaito got those links

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,870
adding a little bit more white space in

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,060
between the tables and this led to a 20%

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,740
improvement engagement 5% boosts and

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,120
products out of the cart and a 33

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,910
percent improvement in customers

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,230
continuing on through purchase so back

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,350
to our little form what you can't see

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,290
the background but we're just going to

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,800
add some more white space to it so we're

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,500
going to add spice you know between the

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,570
the lines of text we're going to add

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,480
spacing in the form elements by adding a

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,670
little bit more space in the inputs adds

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,560
more space in the button just kind of

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:05,079
air it out just a little bit in general

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,450
that comes to visual design reducing

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,300
visual clutter is one of the big steps

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,000
you can you can take to making your

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,380
designs look better and you can do that

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,720
by keeping the number of fonts and

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,300
colors slow adding whitespace and lining

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,829
things up so in general it's a new

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,529
designer I recommend people to stick

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:25,510
with a clean design you can always play

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:30,160
things more as you get better but that's

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,270
a really great way to place a start but

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800
we're not done yet because we need to

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,750
talk about user experience because

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,700
design isn't just how it looks but also

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,270
how it works and this is another area

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,770
that I could probably do in hours long

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:47,220
presentation on and I'm going to stuff

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:48,940
it into just a few minutes in general

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,829
whenever you're working on a design

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,089
don't just try to make it look good but

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,980
try to think about what you want

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,480
something to do so if you're working on

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,130
a form you want someone to be able to

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,130
fill out that form you're working on

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:05,050
like a blog post and you have a call to

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,149
action in your blog posts instead of

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,060
hiding that call-to-action as like a

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,430
link within a paragraph try pulling out

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,610
that link and making an actual form and

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,350
having a button there that draws the eye

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,120
because when you're working in design if

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,250
you say yeah I'm writing this blog post

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,620
because hopefully someone will then sign

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,440
up for my newsletter keeping that in

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:31,420
mind will help you focus on the things

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,459
that you need people to see and use you

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,080
know this is why buttons on forms are

00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,870
generally a brighter color at

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,090
and the rest of the forms it wants to

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:44,080
draw the I want someone to know how to

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,230
submit that form and it's why you know

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,590
when you have big banners on websites

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,420
why this this website has a fairly

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,130
desaturated background a nice bright

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,280
blue button right and this brain in the

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,170
front catch the eye this doesn't have

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,580
any buttons this is the well front

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,230
engineering blog and you can argue that

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,880
wealthfront has this blog because they

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,920
want people to read the articles written

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,330
by the engineers and they go wow this

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,390
place looks like a great place to work

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:13,450
and then boom there's this bright green

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:15,100
badge on the right side to draw the eye

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,180
and hopefully people click on it and

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,570
apply to work at wealthfront

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,830
so this is really condensed but in

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,200
general try to pay attention to your

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,460
goals make them easy to find and use

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,590
think about that when you're working on

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,170
design not just how it looks but how

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,250
it's working and this is a place where

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,990
you need to start paying attention to

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,460
data and analytics for that for you

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,080
design something in relation really

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,790
since the world you should see whether

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,160
it is working in the way that you want

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:46,960
it to all right content this is also

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,580
part of design it's not just like the

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,710
colors and the typography but it's

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,390
actual words you have on the page so

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:56,470
going over there's some of those big

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,270
principles less is more now people who

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,300
are working on design save creating

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,400
their about page for their their

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,070
personal website tend to put in a giant

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,170
essay about themselves well people do

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,560
not read on the internet they do not

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,030
read in whole they skim and the shorter

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,370
more concise you can make something the

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:20,110
more likely that the person on your

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:21,880
website or design is going to read it so

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,470
if you have something like this please

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,760
note that although chrome is sorted from

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,740
o'the back Mac and Windows operating

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,390
systems is recommended that all users of

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,100
the site switch to the most up-to-date

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,740
version that the Firefox web browser for

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,990
the best possible results that is so

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,770
long it's technically correct like

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,300
that's an actual that's a sentence but

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,790
you couldn't read it you can rewrite it

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,560
as just simply for best results use the

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,110
radius version of Firefox Chrome for Mac

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,880
and Windows is also supported much more

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,540
concise easier Genesis

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,280
and much shorter easier to read so in

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,600
general big paragraphs are a sign of

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
clutter so if you have a lot of

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,490
paragraphs on where you're designing

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,230
think about ways you can make it shorter

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,990
easier to skim like a good rule of thumb

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:09,040
for this is like two to three sentences

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,860
per paragraph and break into bullets if

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,450
you can so if you have a way if you have

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,660
a paragraph that's kind of annoying to

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,520
read and it's a listing of items you see

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,780
this a lot on blog posts on medium on

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,490
time people will throw these bullets in

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,110
and give someone a place so that they

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:30,960
can skim and skim over the content and

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:33,670
see better the interior of the paragraph

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,970
okay we've got the headlines that's also

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,770
part of content headline hints keep them

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,230
succinct same thing with content try to

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,970
keep them short and sweet and use

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,860
natural and friendly language don't

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:50,050
sound like a robot a lot of people will

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,280
tend to think really clinically when

00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,890
they're thinking about the words they

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,160
put on their website and talk benefits

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,170
not details for example this is

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,700
technically what my book is about my

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,200
pillow a bad book it is an introduction

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,220
to building web apps using Python and

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,500
Django but this is a terrible headline a

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,960
much better more compelling headline is

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,600
learn how to build a web app this tells

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,860
that this is the talking the benefits to

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,100
the readers noting the details one of my

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,500
books about this is another place where

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,800
a headline change can like improve your

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,750
bottom line so essentially this blog

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,370
post is just all it is I took their

00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,280
headline and change it to talk benefits

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:34,200
instead of just the details and improve

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,200
conversions by 52.8%

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,410
so we're not done with this we we kind

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,870
of open it up and made it look less

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,300
cutter II but let's update the text as

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,070
well yeah make it a little welcome-back

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,100
log back into your account it sounds

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,390
more human yeah I said it was like

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,460
boring a link at the bottom says

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,020
passport or username recovery you know

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:58,540
you turn into like a human sounding

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:02,830
question last but not least images and

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:04,390
imagery the big rules of thumb here

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,059
stock photos generally look like stock

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,890
photos you can do a lot without having

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,480
any photos or a imagery on your website

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,950
so maybe you know especially if you're

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,200
working on like an open-source project

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,080
you can get away with just doing flat

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,070
colors and just it may be like a

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,059
screenshot of the terminal window

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,620
remember the pay attention the file size

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,899
also it's another reason why I try to

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,149
avoid using a lot of big images because

00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:30,850
it can float up your website and because

00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:32,860
we evolved what retina computers now

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:37,029
you'll have to have giant images to make

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:40,210
them look good on retina screens but

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,730
nice icons and images can go can really

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,860
elevate my design yeah and they can be

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,100
pretty simple like this example on

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:51,159
stripe so my favorite resource for

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:54,070
finding nice-looking not stock images as

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,679
unsplash.com and this is all free for

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,690
use anyone can use them you can use them

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,190
for your commercial projects it's a

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,409
really really great place for nice

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,950
professional quality looking

00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:07,929
professional-looking images

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,220
photo pin searches Flickr for Creative

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,200
Commons images and it's a good resource

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,130
for finding pictures of people doing

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,779
things you know in places like Fiverr

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,039
like some people don't let some

00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,600
designers on like Fiverr because you

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,179
know you're you're getting cheap design

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,649
but I think for someone who is a working

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,480
on your first design project you want to

00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:28,889
get some simple icons on Fiverr is a

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,889
great place for doing for finding that

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,429
now these are this is a website done by

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,190
some friends of mine and a their

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,679
homepage they're above the fold contents

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,299
is very simple very flat I'm just shows

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,789
a terminal window but one of the things

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,970
that they did it was really cool is they

00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:47,409
went away from the typical techie

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,750
imagery and they worked with a local

00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:51,159
artist in Toronto to do these alleles

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,500
missions for them and you don't usually

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,610
see that on a very techie looking

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,580
website kind of made them stand out so

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,580
you can get away from just using tech

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,230
like stock photos or you know stock Ida

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,210
icons if you can work with a local

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,710
designer and get something that looks

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,070
kind of cool for your project so back to

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,500
this

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,320
you know what about adding a little icon

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,640
on here now in the full version there's

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,340
a little bit of a background like a

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,080
subtle background as well but you just

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,780
have to just add like a little cherry on

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,210
top the the imagery just adding this

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,070
icon doesn't do much for the usability

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:33,200
of the form but it makes it just look a

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,600
little nicer that's kind of what I the

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,830
way I view icons and imagery and whatnot

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,270
it's just like that cherry on top so for

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,970
the reason these resources we've gone

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,480
from doing this going from here to here

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,760
which is pretty cool

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,510
applying these design principles in a

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,050
step-by-step manner

00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:00,080
all right last a little bit on theory

00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:02,510
and the importance of imitation so if

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,740
you are a new designer and you have to

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,450
work on a new project and you sit down

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,160
your desk and you wipe it clean and

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,490
you're like I'm gonna work on this

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,600
design you pull out paper and pencil

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,940
starting from scratch with no

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,220
inspiration that's a lot like trying to

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,590
work on a new programming project

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,850
without the use of Google or Stack

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:26,390
Overflow inspiration looking at other

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:27,650
designs you know I always would be

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,750
careful in this Park site well I don't

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:32,270
be like go steal that in you know those

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,390
designs out there but be inspired look

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:42,380
at whether people are doing I get the

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:46,010
ideas from that so my hello about book

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,770
is very obviously inspired by the

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,550
awesome looking book apart books you

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:55,670
know a dramatic typography flat color is

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,040
bright pretty simple I did not copy a

00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,810
book apart but I use them to inspire my

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,180
books and my books would look the way

00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:05,090
they do if I didn't have a book apart

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,580
for inspiration so there's a lot of

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,460
places online to find inspiration in a

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,610
lot of places where people curate design

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,080
like site inspire I match style CSS

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,510
mania there's a bunch of websites out

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,170
there that just people just curate what

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:23,300
they think looks like good design and

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,010
when you find something that you think

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,449
looks good I don't just be like hey

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,009
that's awesome

00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:30,559
try to think about it critically because

00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:33,859
this is a this is a process will help

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,379
train your design intuition so for the

00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:39,619
github website you may like hey this is

00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:41,299
a good looking website why is it good

00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,509
looking why does it seem to be working

00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:46,219
well has a nice big green button that's

00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,799
you know again drawing the eye to this

00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:52,959
form the form is really simple easy to

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:57,319
fill out has a really nice succinct

00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:59,539
headline you know the text has open

00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,249
source and business that's highlighted

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,629
because so that kind of also draws the

00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,479
eye and this is a kind of thing you see

00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:07,069
first so when you see a good design

00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:08,629
don't just like say hey it's a good

00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:10,369
design try to think about what makes a

00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:12,319
good design or what makes a bad design

00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:14,689
and this is going to train your design

00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,359
intuition and when you're working on you

00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:20,589
know future projects it'll be easier for

00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,849
you to kind of regurgitate that design

00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:26,749
make it easier to do your own designs

00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:29,779
from scratch you know this is kind of a

00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:32,289
joke in the art world Pablo Picasso said

00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,979
probably not true good artists copy

00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:37,849
creator of steel

00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:39,949
then Bansky took a Hurst imitate the

00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:43,939
great artists steal there's full-on

00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:47,269
books about this so don't hesitate you

00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:52,309
to look at inspiration and use that to

00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:53,389
help inform your designs in the last a

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:54,979
little bit I just want to do a little

00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:56,899
review of the design process to make it

00:25:54,979 --> 00:26:00,439
feel a little bit less intimidating at

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:03,439
least how I do it so the very step one

00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:05,899
is to collect inspiration and sketch

00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:08,389
ideas and I actually do this I actually

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:12,109
follow a bunch of those those website

00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:14,779
design websites in my feedly like Google

00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:16,639
Reader clone and can I get up through

00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:18,559
and pick out the ones I think have some

00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:20,689
good ideas and kind of sketch them out

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,749
now when I say sketching I don't mean

00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:27,439
this this person is showing off sketches

00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:29,419
do not have to look like this sketching

00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:31,759
is just boxes and lines and squiggles

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,439
whatever you whatever works for you to

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,209
kind of like get those ideas out on

00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:36,859
paper so you can refer them later so

00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:40,479
these are sketches from my redesign of

00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:40,479
the Hello iBooks website

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,560
now when it comes in mocking something

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,960
up so you might be tempted to go

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,360
straight to HTML but mocking up makes it

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,160
easy to move around elements and try new

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,820
things faster than if you're working in

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,830
code early working in HTML it doesn't

00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,720
have to look perfect so I was doing this

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,180
mock-up for project that my husband was

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,560
working on and this mock-up just black

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,530
and white not the fonts were gonna use

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,430
obviously not the colors growing here

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,130
but it allowed us to figure out the

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,110
layouts and the content and then how we

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,260
want things to be working on this very

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,690
simple design occasionally I will do

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,700
full on like mock-ups like this but this

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,040
is really rare as a designer when I'm

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,990
working on as a design a freelancer it's

00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,550
more likely to look like this so just

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,880
figure out how things are me working

00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:34,760
rather than there looking and then build

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,590
it which is you know so we'll leave you

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,060
with this this is my thought process

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,680
I've been doing design since well

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,350
technically since I was 12 and I'm 33

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,520
now so that's a long time and every

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,350
single time we're working on a new

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,720
design this is what goes on through my

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:53,180
head every time in sometimes it's not

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,970
even yes maybe it's maybe but it always

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,710
starts out like awful terrible I'm a

00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,240
terrible designer nothing is working

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,860
right until a magical moment where I

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,030
kind of move something into place and

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,820
I'm like oh this actually looks like a

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:08,330
real design so if you're feeling my way

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,220
working as a design I sure you're not a

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,030
bad designer you're just simply any

00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,250
designer welcome to the club

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,630
so this is only the starting point

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,790
remember too when you're working on

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,890
designs working the visual design reduce

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,180
that clutter that visual clutter you do

00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,670
that by keeping the number of fonts and

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,590
colors low adding white space lining

00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,190
things up and keeping content short and

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,050
easy to skin make sure your goal is easy

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,400
to find and use so think about what you

00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,100
want to achieve with your design not

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,680
just how it's going to look keep your

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,410
content simple friendly and to the point

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,150
and above all practice practice practice

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,730
because I reassure you that's going to

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:50,600
be easier just like programming gets

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,680
easier at a time so this design so I

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,560
have this

00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,990
presentation in written format on medium

00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,020
so if you want to read it in full-on

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,880
text words is there and there's also a

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,180
whole book version I have a few of these

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,410
books on me so yeah I hope this was

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,410
informative thank you for having me

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,050
