Kids need conquerable programming challenges. But creating a project that challenges a variety of skill levels is difficult! Using python and the game scissors paper rock we'll show you how we create all kinds of projects as part of a program designed for engaging kids at all levels in programming.

hello and welcome back after room change

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,429
and there wouldn't be a technology

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,940
conference without technology problems

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,350
this is Renee Renee Noble is the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,690
director of the girls programming

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,920
network and software engineer at edge'

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,289
tech company

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,939
grok learning Renee's passion is

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,650
education and community development and

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,599
when she's writing code to help build

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,099
the grok learning platform organizing

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,140
the next girls programming network

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,630
workshop or even teaching a swing

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,550
dancing class Renee is there to spread

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,530
her passion knowledge and joy to others

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,510
and encourage them to pass it on which

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,640
is awesome and she is talking about

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,230
scissors paper rock your classroom with

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,780
differentiated projects thank you very

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,760
much Renee Thank You Amanda it's Madison

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,350
all right I am the director of the girls

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,329
programming Network I am a software

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,640
engineer and content developer at Groff

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,789
learning and I'm supported by data 61

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,710
who helps me with my gpn various

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,739
adventures and I'm here to tell you

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,780
about what how to disappear to rock your

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,010
classroom with differentiated projects

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,830
I'm going to get to exactly what

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,659
scissors paper Rocky is but it's

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,670
basically a methodology we've come about

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,320
through the girls programming network or

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,299
gpn as I'm going to call it throughout

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,950
this talk and I'm going to tell you a

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,330
little bit about gpn first to give you

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,280
some context so gpn is a program that

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,460
provides free of coding workshops for

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,409
girls aged 10 to 18 around the country

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,180
a typical Sydney workshop would have a

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,950
hundred and seventy girls but you

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,200
luckily have a large amount of women

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,150
there to help tutor them on the day we

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,700
have about sixty women there to help out

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,869
and we have a six hour day probably

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,090
about three and a half to four hours of

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,479
coding in that and we're creating Python

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,189
projects in that day we have girls from

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,020
all levels of programming experience

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,520
from complete beginners who've never

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,049
touched code before in their life two

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,500
kids who've been coming to GPM for five

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,439
years

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,390
and basically our idea of the day is to

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,920
give them an authentic programming

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,939
experience where they create this

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,270
project and essentially we all want to

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,470
get more girls into code so our

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,870
methodology of getting girls in there is

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,600
no barriers to entry where you don't

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,280
want any scale

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,690
pre-requisites we don't want any scary

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,010
leveling things we don't want something

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,860
that's going to stop them from clicking

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,420
sign me up to gpn before we get there so

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,280
we're all about eliminating those

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,710
barriers so we're just about creating a

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,300
fun exciting sounding thing that the

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,620
girls are happy to sign up to and on the

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,330
day they get there and they create a

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,070
really awesome programming project so

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,240
why do we need to differentiate our

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,310
projects we have 170 girls they've

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,010
signed up without no Barre approach to

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,510
entry and so we have no idea how much

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,700
programming they know they don't know

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,020
how much programming they know either so

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,030
we get there on the day and we can't

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,010
have to work out how much they kind of

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,050
know and then we have to have a project

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,210
that is flexible enough to let us go on

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,910
the fly with who whatever girls were to

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,200
get turning up on the day and everyone

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,060
needs to have a fun and awesome time

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,210
creating a project the thing is we

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,640
advertise one project so for our

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,590
scissors paper aqua project Dave will

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,290
say come and make Susan's paper Rock a

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,450
fun text-based game every girl needs to

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,850
go home at the end of the day and say

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,190
they made a scissors paper rock game but

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,870
at the same time we need everyone to go

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,730
home and say I also learned something

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,670
really cool and it was hard but it was

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,850
really fun so we have this broad range

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,100
of abilities and a broad range of Ages

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,900
as well and different learning paces and

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,040
they all need a challenge but they all

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,840
need to make something that does the

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,670
same thing and we kind of say well we'll

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,500
make a really bad version of scissors

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,810
paper rock and beginners and we'll have

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,370
a fantastical gooey excitement

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,170
extravaganza over here in an hour in

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,810
advance classroom it all needs to look

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,310
like everyone did an awesome project and

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,990
everyone just needs to feel challenged

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,820
and like they've extended themselves in

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:59,290
their programming knowledge so we have

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,450
done a bunch of different projects at

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,770
gpn and as we've grown and we've got

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,370
more girls and we've spread around the

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,870
country and we've you know broadened our

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,670
program to a whole range of girls

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,230
whether they be in cans or Canberra

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,750
there's a whole range of abilities of

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,250
both the girls and as well as the

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,960
tutoring staff whether they're

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,299
University students their school

00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,560
teachers or their hobbyist mums who want

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,240
to help out and get their kids into

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,130
coding or they're professional software

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,530
engineers we have a whole range of

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,250
people helping out to teach this so

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,670
we've had to grow

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,410
our methodology to be able to support

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:35,350
allowing these people to help get girls

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,390
excited about coding so we've had a

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,250
bunch of projects over the years that

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,600
have helped us get create this

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,400
methodology that I'm going to tell you

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,630
about today so I'm just going to tell

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,640
you about some of the things that we

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,350
noticed along the way that helped us

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,200
kick out what was important about a

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,340
project and what you know you might want

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,110
to avoid so I'm gonna take you through

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,450
the good the bad and the ugly bits of

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,280
different projects and I love all of our

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,600
projects but you know there's always a

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,280
part you're like well I wish this was a

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,140
little bit easier well that was great

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,880
and I'd like to replicate that again so

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm gonna start with some of the bad the

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,919
bad ideas we used to when we only had

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,180
you know fifty girls we had two

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,620
classrooms and we didn't have any

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,540
workbook so I'm gonna tell you about how

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,370
we make workbooks today but we used to

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,900
go straight off slides everything was on

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,330
slides and the kids would have to kind

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,620
of code along and go as you you know as

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,110
the lecturer went through it in the

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,700
classroom the problem is some kids get

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,990
ahead they get bored they start

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,500
distracting the rest of the classroom

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,690
some kids get left behind we've headed

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,240
over five slides later and they're still

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,620
trying to do print HelloWorld and they

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,450
don't know whether to go next

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,650
so we at some point we moved to

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,180
workbooks and it turned out it was a

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,130
great idea because everyone could move

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,660
at their own pace but we still have

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,470
lectures that we want to be able to keep

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,210
all the kids in sync for also we have

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,590
had we've done a bunch of web dev

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,690
projects so in this is now cookie

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,100
clicker project but the problem there is

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,840
you have to give him a bunch of stuff

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,120
first so we've gone here's all the HTML

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,570
here's all the CSS and we just want you

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,760
to do the JavaScript stuff for the today

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,530
but then we get stuck with the girls

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,180
don't really exactly know how their

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,620
thing is working so they couldn't go

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,330
home and make a new project by

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,950
themselves they know how to add

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,690
something to something but they don't

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,160
know how to start it from scratch so

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,740
it's not a complete authentic

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,020
programming experience and then we've

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,030
had projects that were tackling rather

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,130
than project led so we're like we really

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,700
want to try something with these Nick

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,350
t81

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,030
Arduino Zoar we really want to teach the

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,830
kids in networking but we've started

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,479
with the idea first of what we want to

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,800
teach and we haven't had the narrative

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,260
or the thing we're going to build first

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,210
so starting from there it made it hard

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,280
to make it an interesting experience for

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,020
the kids without making it you know

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,729
trivial or just kind of

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,340
we've fabricated just so we could teach

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,979
you this one thing we wanted to teach

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,610
now into the ugly things I love pygame

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,050
but it's a bit tricky sometimes firstly

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,560
installing it we heard about that in the

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,080
last talk

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,610
it's a nightmare secondly you know you

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,740
end up with a bunch of boilerplate code

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,650
sometimes you just like just trust me

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,449
kids you want this here it's valuable

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,319
yeah you should you'll understand it

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:11,500
later maybe one day it's fine so we have

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,449
yeah we've created our flappy bird game

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,979
in PI game which the kids love to make

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,449
but it does require a bit of

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,250
hand-holding because there's a lot of

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:20,860
steps to getting the working game in

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,659
three and a half hours so we do have to

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,750
give them a little more structure than

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:28,479
we would might want if you know that we

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,190
see in our other projects another thing

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,500
about tie game is you really need to get

00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,259
that game loop going early we have a fun

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,810
story about a workshop where we like no

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,659
we really like teaching our projects in

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:43,180
this order variables if statements then

00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:45,099
loops problem is you get this game loop

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,349
happening lost so we got to the if

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,419
statement section and we're going to you

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,500
know create an event handle off and then

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:52,810
we're going to do something on that

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,909
event handler happening the problem is

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,919
we had an event happens like that happen

00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:59,139
just once and it was looking for any

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,330
event so we had a whole classroom of

00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,219
kids being like why doesn't my project

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,590
work I can't get it to press the space

00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,020
button and do the jumping I'm really sad

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,460
and then you know half an hour later we

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,590
figured out it was just other kids

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,630
bumping the table and the canals

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,159
movements setting off that single event

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,680
handling before we got to the loop

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,509
section of the day so you know you have

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,159
these caveats that if you want to you

00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,569
know use play game you really just have

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,430
to get that loop happening early

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,039
otherwise it's not going to be a fun

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,500
time for anybody and also go down Markov

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,459
chains project we like to create green

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,459
eggs and ham ii where kids generate

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,589
their own you know fun stories from

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,440
existing texts but the problem with this

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,899
workbook is the kids really love what

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,730
comes out at the end but it's we do a no

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,740
10-minute lecture you write one line of

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,790
code you do a five-minute lecture you

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
write one line of code

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,899
the problem with Markov chains is it's

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,779
too tightly around it's too simple you

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,939
can run amok

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,680
Chane an awesome program in like ten

00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:59,060
lines of code but you don't want to just

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,160
write ten lines of code in your floor

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,230
our coding D so those are some of the

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,300
less you know the things we've learnt

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,370
along the way you want more code you

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,139
want less boilerplate and you want to

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,519
make the kids understand everything

00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,410
they're coding on the way through so

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,480
that gets to our good parts of our

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,879
journey which is our scissors paper Rock

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,389
our canonical example of the gpn

00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,160
workbook methodology where we I'll take

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,600
you through an example of how we came to

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,779
that and how you can apply that to

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,759
hopefully any project you can think of

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,999
and other things so just involve writing

00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:34,040
a lot of Python code using basic ideas

00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:36,649
variables if statements and loops and a

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,449
little fun bit extra on the side

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:40,970
these include our sassy chat bot where

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,649
we've just got the kids are trying to

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,910
you know guess a password to a secret

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,589
diary and it's just going to be really

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,389
sassy to you basically doing annoying

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,459
maths questions and never let you into

00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,199
the secret diary and we've got our

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,660
cryptography project where we create a

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:56,629
Caesar cipher which is combining these

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,100
simple Python processes with a little

00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,629
bit of algorithms to make a really fun

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,790
thing that the kids love to send secret

00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:06,649
messages to each other with so how do we

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,800
you know make a project that fits all

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,029
levels well what we do at the start of

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,069
the day is we do what we call our

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,529
streaming quiz it's a fun quiz the kids

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:17,660
come in and we need to work out what

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:19,279
kind of level they're at at the start of

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,870
the day because we can't it's really

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,500
difficult to say we're going to have one

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,639
project singular and then everyone's

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,199
going to start at the same point and

00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,610
we're going to just add all the concepts

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,829
on together so what we actually do is we

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,300
do three projects that are the same idea

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:34,009
so we're gonna have three versions of

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,649
scissors paper rock by the end of this

00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,689
so we work out if the kids have done no

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,759
programming before or they really need a

00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,529
refresher on the complete basics we work

00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,000
out that they go into beginners if they

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,069
are kind of comfortable with variables

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,100
and if statements up into intermediate

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:52,100
you go and if you're pretty confident in

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,019
variables if statements and for loops or

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,249
while loops up into advance you go we're

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,689
going to extend you into some other

00:10:55,249 --> 00:11:01,429
harder concepts so we've got our basic

00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,809
beginner project here beginner

00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,519
intermediate advanced these are our base

00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,250
level workbooks these are where we're

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,689
going to cover our core concepts so in

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,839
beginners and beginners are going to

00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:14,089
cover our if statements variables loops

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,279
probably input or some sort of event

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,860
handling thing intermediate we'll cover

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,389
all of those plus one of functions files

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,730
or dictionaries so a harder level

00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,879
concept and advanced all of those

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,920
previous ones plus oh oh oh I really

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:32,420
like that name now so we're next

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,610
take those workbooks because we've still

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,800
got that gap we've got kids who will end

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,930
up it's like ah I'm not quite

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,819
intermediate but I'm not quite advanced

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,079
I'm not quite high enough so I'm kind of

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,689
going to be bored at the end of the day

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,860
we need to add a little bit more

00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:47,720
flexibility to this arrangement so each

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,420
of these bars is representing our effort

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,209
loads or out like our kind of workload

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,399
for the day so we're going to add in

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,680
these bonus activities so if we kind of

00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,800
slice them in as we go along and these

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,990
are activities that are placed inside

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,620
the workbook as kind of extra things

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,269
they can do

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,250
they're completely skippable they're

00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,610
just things that add functionality to

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,740
the project so something that will slow

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,569
the kids down moving the faster kids

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,860
sideways rather than exacerbating the

00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,000
problem by giving them extra knowledge

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,910
that's going to get them moving ahead

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,740
even faster and these are things that

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,939
don't normally require any lectures so

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,170
it's his little box we're going to give

00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,850
you a concept and you're gonna have to

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,379
figure out how to put that into your

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,189
project and I'm going to go through a

00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,809
few examples of these later the great

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,610
thing about these is when we want to

00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:36,290
keep our class together for lectures we

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,180
can say how about you just try the bonus

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,740
at the end of part 3 and then while you

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,329
do that you know everyone else is going

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,250
to catch up and we'll all move on to

00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:44,629
part four together and we'll all be able

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,920
to cover the lecture material at the

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:50,990
same time so it's good for keeping

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,360
everyone cohesive finally we add on our

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,250
life which is extensions we just make

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,750
the project go forever you've got a kid

00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,490
that's like covered all the core

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,470
concepts in together with your class but

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,939
they're just flying through yeah just

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,769
hand them a bunch of extension it's a

00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,029
great thing about extensions is you can

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,490
take the project that they now

00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,649
completely understand and then they can

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,389
rearrange it they can add in more

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,569
concepts and you can do a lot of

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:16,250
creative things with this so we can edit

00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,319
our existing project or we can add to it

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,870
we could do multiple extensions in any

00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,339
order or you can create a bunch of

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,170
tensions they keep building on top of

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,720
each other kind of just keep it along

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,710
with that project idea of keeping moving

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,330
through and it's a great way to Calvet

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,010
extra concepts you might want to cover

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,810
but not want to cover with the whole

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,089
class it's kind of a you know separating

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,410
it from your core project makes all the

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,940
kids feel like they've achieved the

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,120
whole project and then some kids gets to

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,580
do it a little bit extra so we need to

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,720
make an ideal idea first before we get

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,850
started so this means we want to find a

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,560
project that is realistic for business

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,839
and then we're going to extend on that

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,580
so we're gonna start with fun project

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,420
ideas so we need it to be fun it needs

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,040
to be something that's going to give

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,180
them a sense of completion something

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,070
that they're going to understand and be

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,630
able to own something that's going to be

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,040
interactive and something is an

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,380
authentic programming experience

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,000
something that's going to be able to you

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:16,300
know relate to something that in the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,480
real world for them cool so now we need

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,700
to this is a good al right we'd all love

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,470
to be able to draw this out one day yes

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,589
but it's not really an achievable

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,839
drawing project for a beginner and do

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,970
they even care about drawing us out

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,740
possibly not they want to draw something

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,839
fun something shoot I don't think they

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,339
care about this photorealistic owl that

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,360
you know if you called the draw but you

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,220
know they might actually want to draw

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
something else more so what I'm saying

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,490
is when we create a project we didn't

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,339
have to create a perfectly shippable

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,050
project that does all the bells and

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:48,660
whistles and accounts for all kinds of

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,250
users and all kinds of

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,480
misinterpretations what we want to do is

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,360
something fun that the kids are going to

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,980
understand and what we do need to do is

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,320
we need to have all the steps from

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,060
getting started to the finished project

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,339
that we want to want the kids to take

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,050
home at the end of the day this here you

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,910
know clearly missing a few steps but

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,040
it's also missing the idea that

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,810
beginners don't have even if we had

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,700
infinite time they might not be able to

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,589
get to this hour by the end of our

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,390
infinite time project because it's that

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,339
practice using those skills and

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,080
different scenarios that gives us you

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,970
know our ability to text you this hour

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,250
we can't just teach one programming

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,690
concept and then assume it's set solid

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,880
in their brain and just keep building on

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,550
top of that we need to give them time to

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,640
rest and then you know put all those

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,390
ideas together over a much longer

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,610
several projects so what we want is this

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,230
owl it's much much more achievable I

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,630
think kids will actually like this a lot

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,610
a lot better too it's cute something

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,250
that can relate to and that one there is

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,080
definitely an owl and we don't even need

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,280
to get to the end so what we want with

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,930
our projects is something that takes you

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,610
one step at a time and every step at the

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,440
time you're getting a little bit closer

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,570
to the alley or a drawer or the project

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,980
you want to make so even if you only get

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,220
to that fourth al there you can say I

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,570
definitely made an owl today and I can't

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,400
you know don't have a problem with that

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,970
I know there were bonus owls you could

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,320
draw but this one was a good owl so what

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,940
we want with our projects is a clear

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,650
progression and at every step of the way

00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,420
we could say there's a clear part we're

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,680
drawing here drawing the eyes we're

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,990
drawing the circles around the eyes give

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,420
it a body a beak and a tail and that's

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,490
pretty much an hour already so creating

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,690
a project like this for your programming

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,580
class is what we're aiming for and it's

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,790
also great because we we want a project

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,280
like this where we can divide up our

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,020
project into discrete concepts so here

00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,660
it's no draw a body but it might be

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,120
implement a if statement in your program

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,890
and being able to punctuate our project

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,490
with those different lectures is what

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,150
we're aiming for

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:54,120
so this is our beginner scissors paper

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,300
Rock code and what we've got here is

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,650
just a few four key concepts and what we

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,930
want to play with all our code games is

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:06,839
concept to golf so we often play code

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,280
golf when we're creating code and this

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,770
is clearly is in code golf because it

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,360
has nine if statements in it which you

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,600
might like that's not very pretty but

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,490
what it is it's one concept which is you

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,230
know just learning those concepts is the

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,150
hard part of teaching programming so

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,100
what we have here is a while loop that

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,870
just loops forever

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,610
you have randomly choosing a computer

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,839
movie you have setting a human move and

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,520
you have lots of ear statements to

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,660
decide the winner just for concepts that

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,320
make game and what this game actually

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,540
looks like is it's going to look like

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,470
this and this is what all our strings

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,130
are going to make at the end of the game

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,590
we get to input our move and then it's

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,289
just going to

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,570
playing more games so basically it just

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,640
asks you for your move and it chooses

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,940
one to versity randomly and that's what

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,279
we get so that's our beginners project

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,659
but our advanced and intermediate

00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,010
projects actually going to have an

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,570
interface that looks exactly like that

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,520
it's just going to be harder to get to

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:08,320
it with more steps cool okay cool that's

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,470
mostly on the screen that's fine so

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,409
we've got this code idea and we want to

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,630
know if it is a good idea and what we've

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,520
developed to kind of get out of that

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,200
intuition so people show me code and

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,120
they go Renee is this good is this a

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,520
good thing we could do a GP and I go

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,350
kind of ish maybe here's the things I

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,690
kind of think and this is what we did

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,090
for our coding competition recently when

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,750
we're trying to design new workbooks so

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,309
this is our table of how hard it is to

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,500
learn each concepts so these are how

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,409
many points you would want to kind of

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,149
put aside if you were trying to teach a

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,070
concept so you know we've got a print

00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:46,720
statement stance really cheap but we've

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,899
got functions they're pretty you know

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,240
expensive to use so and we've also got

00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:54,039
three different categories of things in

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,450
here so we've got our piping concepts so

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,940
Daisy yes you know your if statements

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,860
your loops print functions whatever you

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,750
can think of then we've got two other

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,200
categories our tech and theme concepts

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,610
so just adding on things like oh we want

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,049
to use pygame that's just a huge

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,610
overhead if we want to use that there's

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,320
a lot of bits and pieces we need to

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,059
understand or we're going to just add

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,429
algorithmic thinking we want to do

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:17,260
cryptography or something it means the

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:20,320
kids do have to spend a bunch of time in

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,510
the day working out how that concept

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,679
relates to the code so we have to factor

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:29,350
in these different bits and pieces then

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,529
we have code construction concepts as

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,190
well so things like nesting or a you

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:37,750
know a list with tuples inside of it

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,340
means you know that's an extra concept

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,279
trying to get those in the right order

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,740
or just having a lot of stuff to type

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,149
are all factors in you know you need to

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,779
factor in to make sure your project

00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:51,340
isn't too hard on the day so yeah just

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,620
looking up close we can see there's a

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,110
whole range of different you know

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,260
expenses you can pay and what we go for

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,080
on the day

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,670
GPN is 45 to 50 points for our base

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,050
level project so this is what we get

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,880
when we tell the earth our beginners

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,920
scissors paper rock game so we've got

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,840
all our different concepts we had there

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,480
and we have additional use of structures

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,410
we have nine if statements so we have to

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,630
pay a penalty

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,250
so it's if Santi lifts and we have

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,290
nested code as well we have our if

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,090
statement inside a for inside a while

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,470
loop and just getting the kids to put

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,360
them in the right order just getting

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:29,990
them to indent that code just cost you a

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:32,260
lot of points so yes so once we have

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,580
that we get to break it down into steps

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:38,180
because we want to properly draw that

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,590
out so we what we do a GP Enya's we like

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,960
to teach things hopefully in a

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,520
pedagogically appropriate order so we

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,560
start with a print statement we often

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,540
add things that aren't in the final code

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,450
just to step them through it so we first

00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,790
start by hard coding a computer move and

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,350
then we that's a nice you know simple

00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,920
use of variables then we move on to

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,660
input asking the player for a move do

00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,040
all the if statements and the great

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,080
thing about the if statement is if you

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,640
need help on the first one and you need

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,080
a bit of hand-holding that's okay

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,420
because you're gonna have eight more

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,060
ones you're gonna do by yourself to

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,410
cement that understanding finally oh no

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,850
it got finally if we get to randomize

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,380
the computer moves next which is the

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,850
part the kids loves it just loves that

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,180
the computer can choose a random things

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,580
and then finally we add the while loop

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:26,270
cool so now it's time to differentiate

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,400
the project's so we have want to get to

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,140
this ultimately at the end we've got our

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,790
bonuses in the middle we've got our

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,530
extensions at the end and we've got our

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,550
beginnings intermediate and advanced so

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,860
first I'm going to take you through

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,900
adding in some bonuses things that we

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,360
like to do at GPM to add some bonuses

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,650
are things that make it look no fun so

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
the first one I'm going to say is our

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,640
ASCII art so instead of just saying

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,830
computer played paper computer played I

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,420
am the sheet of paper much cuter that's

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,550
a fun thing to add in it doesn't change

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,470
the functionality of the game at all so

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,460
it's just a nice sidestep to distract

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,400
the kids for a while

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,800
and see what they can do with text

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,320
another one I like to use is sleep time

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,030
don't sleep kids are always like I wish

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,560
our computers thing seemed more like a

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,090
person playing and like great we're

00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,280
going to use time don't sleep you kill

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,239
them this one line time don't sleep is

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,129
the thing that

00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:14,869
and now they can go and add it through

00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,200
their game wherever they like they can

00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:19,940
you know spend you know five minutes

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,349
putting that in throughout their game to

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,649
you know slow it down and make it seem

00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,970
more fun next we have our extension so

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:29,179
things that go on to the end of the game

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,859
this is a great example here is a little

00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:33,019
paper rock lizard-spock

00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:36,409
it's a way they can extend their game

00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,519
with more you know this fun mimi version

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:39,349
of the game that they might have heard

00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:44,149
of or we can add things like a high

00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:47,090
score table using you know new piles or

00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:49,099
something like that and then we finally

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,379
want to get to living a leveling up our

00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:53,419
project so we want to take our beginners

00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,129
intermediate and advanced projects into

00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,450
the day so we need to take our beginners

00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:58,279
one and we're going to take this two

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,889
intermediate advanced with some concepts

00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:03,229
switching so what this means is we've

00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:04,879
got this is our beginners project and

00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,470
what we're going to do to take it to

00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,879
intermediate level is we're going to see

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,970
what we can do to make it a bit more

00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:12,200
elegant and add some more concepts so

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,149
what we've done is we've removed a

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,029
million if statements or we replaced it

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:19,399
with this nice dictionary instead so

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:21,710
they get to investigate dictionaries and

00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,179
instead of just having that while loop

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,220
that just went forever we're going to

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,539
properly investigate for loops iterating

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,979
through those for a fixed number of

00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:33,289
games then to step this up to advanced

00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:34,999
we get into objects with methods and

00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:36,769
attributes we're basically going to take

00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:39,889
our intermediate program and wrapped it

00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:43,460
up nice and tightly using classes for

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:46,279
players and for the game as well finally

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,220
we get to this table so what we have

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,139
here is now we have a column beginners

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,639
intermediate and advanced and we assign

00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,859
them different points and how high the

00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,179
concept is at that level and you might

00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,159
say that's a bit strange you could just

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:00,470
have a instead of having a 45 point

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,179
project in beginners and you might want

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,639
to have a 90 point project in advance

00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:06,349
but what we do with this table here

00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:08,450
firstly we have some things that appear

00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:11,450
that didn't appear before we don't want

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,940
to teach it to beginners it's a little

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,909
bit scary but also some things become

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,960
free so print that's now free in advance

00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:19,369
you don't have to think about it they'll

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,129
just chuck it in there you didn't have

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:23,570
to tell them otherwise some things

00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,770
become easier so if statements they

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,930
still take a bit of time to

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,580
but didn't have to teach them from the

00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,860
scratch so instead of being a four-point

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,260
thing they're now a one-point thing but

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,210
what is interesting is some things never

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,980
get easier for instance making a

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,020
creative choice but they get to make

00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,000
something pretty design it themselves no

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,440
it's always five points they always get

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,030
is distracted whether it's their first

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,710
day programming or they've been doing it

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,570
for five years or they're you know a

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,370
software engineer they still is still

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,360
five points it still takes a lot of time

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:56,750
to decide so this is how we at gpn

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,000
create projects that mean we can teach

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,610
girls all around the country how to code

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,710
in these one-day workshops with tutors

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,150
of all different levels of capabilities

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,000
students of all different levels of

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,980
capability experience and ages and so we

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,130
hope you give out one of our calculators

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,740
to go play concept golf rather than code

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,720
golf to simplify your projects and add

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,190
some bonuses and extensions and

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,080
different levels to see how you can

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,280
differentiate your classroom and let us

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,560
know how you go because we're still

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,090
working on this methodology and yeah I

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,530
want to see how it works for you maybe

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,060
you need a different amount of points in

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,400
your classroom whether you're doing it

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,990
for three hours or three weeks or three

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,880
months we'd love to see how it fits in

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,550
with you so yeah let me know how it goes

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,680
you can email me if you are a woman who

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,690
codes are you know one and you want to

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,520
cheater at girls programming Network we

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,440
would love to have you so go to girls

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,540
programming Network calm and clicks have

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,610
become a tutor button and then I will

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,320
send you emails and it will be fun and

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:58,360
you will get two scissors paper rock

00:25:51,320 --> 00:26:02,440
with me excellent

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,000
we have time for maybe one question

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,130
while someone is putting up their hand

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm gonna read off the slide that it's

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:15,440
girls programming dot network ah yes

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:18,740
one question excellent this is an easy

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,150
yes/no question is the calculator is

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:26,740
there an actual like web knock you later

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:31,850
okay not yet that's a hashtag concept

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:36,520
but we will take pool requests that's

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,520
yet yes thank you for volunteering

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:47,060
that was super short is there anything

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:49,730
else yeah yep do you run them in all

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,810
states oh and we have them currently in

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,760
Sydney Canberra Perth Kansan Makai and

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:59,810
others pending yes there will be yes and

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,110
some of them are run by software

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:07,190
professionals yes teaches teachers yeah

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,040
basically anyone who wants to run one

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:15,350
you can have one later yeah we're

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:18,920
working on making it highly scalable is

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:20,480
it hard to find a venue um well we try

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,030
and like we work with the University of

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,380
Sydney so it's easy for us and lots of

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,770
schools are willing to open their doors

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,680
and things like that yeah but if that

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:33,020
was someone offering a venue somewhere

00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,720
please get in contact yeah what you're

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,070
yes yes yeah you you seem to have a

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,470
venue goods we all have that alright

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:49,720
thank you so much Renee I'm gonna mug

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,720
