Danger Will Robinson! Warning! Warning! Warning! (What Python warnings are, why you should turn them on and how to create your own)

Python's warnings mechanism is an important part of creating robust, reliable, production grade code. Unfortunately, it's also one of the most under-used standard libraries. Help find the bugs and errors with warnings! Ignore them at your peril! Suitable for beginner to intermediate.
