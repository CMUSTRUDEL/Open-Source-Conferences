so but I'm not going to forget to

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,680
introduce Tom because Tom's our next

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,469
invited speaker um if you've been to a

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,750
pike on Australia before or a Kiwi Pike

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,880
on or the odd pike on us you've probably

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,710
met Tom before he's been coming to Pike

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,600
on a used since 2013 and helped run or

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,720
know he was the conference director for

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,449
Kiwi Pike on 2014 he has a day job as

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,230
well at coordinates in Wellington New

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,940
Zealand and we invited Tom here because

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,520
while he was going to come anyway but

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,280
also we intentionally wanted to give him

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,250
the big room on purpose and to give him

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,390
the space to share stuff that we think

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,789
is important to the people in this room

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,250
and I'm gonna let Tom take it from here

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,660
so if everyone could help me in giving

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,230
Tom Eastman a wonderful round of

00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:02,470
applause

00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:02,470
[Applause]

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm giving this talk today because

00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,090
recently I've started to think I might

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,560
be getting Dumber but to explain why I

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,830
kind of have to go back to when I first

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,330
started working with Python it was a

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,070
while ago I'm sorry I've waited years

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,850
for an excuse to use this photo in the

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,640
talk but it's a little disingenuous can

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,009
anyone actually tell me why but that's

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,759
not actually a Python the boa

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,229
constrictor but yeah okay so so later

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,270
than this later than this I was at

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,119
university around the turn of the

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,039
century which makes me feel kind of old

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,320
the languages we were learning at the

00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,580
time were mainly Java and C and there

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,780
was like a smattering of other languages

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,250
for flavor you know like Lisp and

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,340
Haskell and small talk and kind of those

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,930
exotic ones and I had a programming

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,060
assignment for my data database paper

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,970
which was implementing something called

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,590
a candidate Keys algorithm and I don't

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,149
even know what that is anymore but it's

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,459
something that databases just do for me

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,519
these days and my solution for this

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,549
assignment was about 1,500 lines of Java

00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,500
right and my professor had written his

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,340
model answer in something called Python

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,980
which I never even heard of and we were

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,720
nosy of course so I went digging through

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,430
my email to try and find where I was

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,970
snoozing to the professor this is also

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,320
just ingenuity cuz the fetch mail comp

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,670
source code does not make for

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,530
interesting reading the assignment you

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,060
required a lot of set manipulation it

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,799
needed a lot of sort of set theory stuff

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,959
like a lot of data base C relational

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,250
things do and Nathan was able to

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,980
short-circuit all of that by using

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,120
Python dictionary keys whereas you know

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,230
for our assignments we kind of had to

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,810
write implement all our own data

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,610
structures in Java so his model answer

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,630
to this assignment was 35 lines of

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,390
Python I looked I looked at my 1,500

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,160
lines of Java I looked at his 35 lines

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,830
of Python and I kind of made a life

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,630
decision

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,190
so I'm still after that I didn't really

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,840
look back I used Python for everything

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,600
where I had the option I used it for all

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,030
my postgraduate work and Python at the

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,460
time at least in Dunedin and in New

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,930
Zealand was pretty rare it was it was

00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,390
kind of a secret weapon for me and I

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,220
started using it I was the odd one out I

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,480
felt kind of a lead right because at the

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,610
time the the high level scripting

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,920
language of choice was Perl so I was a

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,900
hipster and my first job outside of

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,180
university was as a sysadmin for the

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,980
medical school still in Dunedin and we

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,660
had some big curl we had some big Perl

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,510
code bases we were using that we started

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,390
migrating to Python and Django and this

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,990
was in 2006 when the current version of

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,960
Django was something called 0.95 magic

00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,790
removal branch and I don't need I don't

00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,830
know what that means but you you know

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,730
and I think you know they know they know

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,140
what that means I don't in 2011 I joined

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,830
catalyst and I was fortunate enough

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,000
there to be the first person hired

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,560
specifically for projects involving

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,810
Python their first their first

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,250
specialist in Python they they already

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,600
had people who knew Python they had

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,820
people there who kind of wanted to be

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,470
speaking Python but they were all stuck

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,190
in non Python projects so I kind of got

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,450
the prize while I was at catalyst I

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,310
developed an interest in information

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,500
security and sort of web app security I

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,150
was going to security meetups where my

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,860
friends were talking about breaking code

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,350
over beers and they tell me a trick that

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,450
would kind of freak me out and I'd head

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,919
back to the office slightly tipsy and

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,810
try it out on my own code and realized

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,830
that it was just as broken and so I

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,260
started talking about that at

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,090
conferences and where I would wave my

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,580
arms around a lot apparently

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:52,860
so today I'm a senior software systems

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,330
engineer at coordinates where I'm

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,150
working with a group of very talented

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,740
Python developers on a geospatial data

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,410
publishing and processing system and

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,490
it's actually the first time that it's

00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,470
the first time in my career that I've

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,210
worked for a Python shop where like

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,580
everyone was doing Python and it's the

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,710
first time that I've worked on a really

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,350
large Python code base built by experts

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,669
who have been at it for a decade and

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,830
who's Python knowledge kind of really

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,419
outclasses mine right there they're a

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,919
really cool team they're friendly smart

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,800
they're encouraged they're encouraging

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,110
they're dedicate

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,880
and I've found myself feeling really

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,880
uncomfortable there for some reason

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,080
all throughout my career I've been

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,850
really lucky like in all my jobs I've

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,380
learned a lot from really smart

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,790
welcoming and friendly colleagues and

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,020
I've always felt happy knowing that I

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,940
kind of had a lot to learn from them and

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,950
it's always been rewarding and in my

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,510
current job I've been learning a lot

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,220
from smart welcoming and friendly

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,990
colleagues and I've been really stressed

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,000
out and and kind of found myself feeling

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,510
discouraged from time to time and it's

00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:05,710
absolutely not my colleagues fault we'll

00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:08,110
be coming back to this okay so in 2015

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,960
in September I flew down to Christchurch

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,340
for a Kiwi Pike on the previous day I

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,570
had burned out and quit my job so I was

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,460
actually I was actually on the kind of

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,020
high that you only get when you've just

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,180
made a decision that you weren't sure

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,100
was the right one but immediately after

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,360
you make it you know like in your bones

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,610
that it was the right thing to do

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,110
and I was feeling like freer than I had

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,510
in months and I and I was looking for

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,580
inspiration and the keynote that year

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,070
was given by a woman named Alison Kaptur

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,110
who is a former teacher at the recurse

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,920
Center which is an educational retreat

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,690
for programmers in New York City Alison

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,560
gave a talk called effective learning

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,600
for programmers

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,700
and she introduced us to some of the

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,790
research on how people improve their

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,030
skills and learn complex fields of

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,640
knowledge and that talk really kind of

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,710
blew my mind and in the weeks afterwards

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,300
I sort of followed up and I read the

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,800
citations and source material behind her

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,250
talk and you know had the spare time I

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,440
was I was an unemployed bum and I'm

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,910
gonna take a few minutes now and recap

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,140
what to me were some of the highlights

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,540
that I learned kind of both from her

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,460
talk and from diving into that into that

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,530
source material so for those of you who

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,330
were at QE PyCon in 2015 this is gonna

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,470
be quite familiar I'm gonna be recapping

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,010
some of those some of the good parts of

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,570
that I'm gonna start with what to me was

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,910
sort of the major revelation and the

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,700
reason why I came away feeling so

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:34,160
inspired by this talk so

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,020
we all know that you can't just like

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,780
memorize an endless amount of things

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,130
right but if you employ the right

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,830
strategies to your learning

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,690
there's no yet measured upper bound on

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,800
what a person is kind of capable of

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,870
learning all learning is cumulative all

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,000
learning is kind of about hanging new

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,380
pieces of understanding on top of the

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,370
framework of knowledge that you've

00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,290
already got and that means that the more

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,300
you do learn the more you can learn and

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,920
the more you branch out and sort of the

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,260
broader you go and sort of the wider

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,850
your experience the more effective

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,680
you'll be at incorporating new knowledge

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,360
in with what you already know it's like

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,730
compounding interest right like the more

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,050
you've got the more you can get and this

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,700
is actually a really important thing for

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,310
me to hear at exactly that moment in my

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,570
life because all my career like I've

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,790
sort of thought of myself as someone who

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,310
could learn whatever tool or language or

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,730
framework was kind of needed to do the

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,690
job at hand and I mean I sold myself as

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,050
that kind of person like that's what I

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,220
would say in job interviews right so to

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,570
be honest I was sort of starting to

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,010
worry that I was turning into a kind of

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,470
a one-trick pony I was really good at

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,390
Python and Django and I was a lot more

00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,640
comfortable when I could twist any

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:51,770
problem I was given into fitting into

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,390
that box I had this fear that if I took

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,820
the time to sit down and learn another

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,070
language say getting on top of angular

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,930
or react or something and JavaScript and

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,420
CSS so I could contribute to front-end

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,920
development that I would a never be as

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,630
good at it as my colleagues who had been

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,070
doing that for ages and be that my

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,780
Python and back-end development skills

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,080
what I knew I was kind of good at would

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,460
would suffer right I'd get rusty but

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,980
that's not actually how this works right

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,630
the amount you can learn is unbounded as

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,760
long as you sort of keep up the practice

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,720
of incorporating the new things that

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,000
you're learning into the scaffolding of

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,320
what you already understand and not only

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,430
that but whether it's related to or

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,320
contrasting with stuff you already know

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,910
it tends to have the effect of deepening

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,360
the understanding of the body of

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,720
knowledge of God however the strategy

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,350
you choose is important because of the

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,350
second lesson

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,240
we as humans kind of have a tendency to

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,330
gravitate towards strategies of learning

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,470
that that feel good and are ineffective

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,720
that are crap

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,540
and and away from strategies that work

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,480
but don't feel so good there's this kind

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,890
of comfortable Pleasant feeling that we

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,070
get when we when we think we're learning

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,780
but were actually kind of not so it's

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,610
like when I'm watching a YouTube video

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,110
on music theory which is something that

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm really into hearing about even

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,200
though I'm not internalizing it or using

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,940
it in any sort of useful way I just

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,920
think it's really cool and I watch sort

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,360
of scishow and crash course and all

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,580
kinds of sort of educational content on

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,920
YouTube who loves these videos they Rock

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,690
they're so cool they're really

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,160
entertaining but it's not often that I

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,600
can actually remember what I was told in

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,070
one of those videos like a day later or

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,030
to say nothing is like a week or a year

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,980
later it's not actually learning it's

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,230
kind of that rush that we get from being

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,600
exposed to something new and interesting

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,490
it's sort of fast acting and fast gone

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,410
it's it's processed sugar right it's

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,560
it's this endorphin rush that social

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,270
media provides sort of an ever ending

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,360
stream of new content just kind of

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,080
coming at you like a firehose I I fall

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
into this trap

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,000
reading technical documentation I lost

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,980
down a side track of documentation for

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,660
like a cool piece of technology and if

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,980
it's not actually related to the problem

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,330
I'm trying to solve it's likely that I

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,530
won't be absorbing it but it's like this

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,960
is really cool I'll just spend ages

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,390
reading the wrong thing I just got lost

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,440
for hours reading about the file format

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,910
schema for SQLite three databases I it's

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,420
got nothing to do with what I'm trying

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,420
to solve so

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,550
what I'm describing here is is addiction

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,350
the novel information right like in a

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,570
bunch of fire hose like sources of

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,920
information that sandblast my brain

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,900
until I'm unable to concentrate on

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,270
anything and at a certain point I have

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,650
to admit to myself that I'm not only not

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,970
really learning and absorbing this stuff

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,220
but it's kind of doing damage to my

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,750
attention span so I want to contrast

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,390
that with what it feels like when your

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:53,940
brain actually is learning it's it's not

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,010
actually a very pleasant feeling think

00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,110
about how you feel when you're debugging

00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,590
a piece of code like when I'm debugging

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,110
I'm holding four layers of framework

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,270
abstractions in my head I'm focused on

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,130
forming hypotheses for what's broken and

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,020
sort of trying to devise systematic ways

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,900
of testing them it

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,000
it's this weird shaky slightly stressful

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,860
anxious feeling it's its frustration and

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,460
it's kind of mixed with a sort of

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:25,020
low-key irritability it's like being

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,070
hangry and and your brain like when

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,810
you're doing this your brain is actually

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,589
having to make the effort it is burning

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,210
calories right the metaphor kind of fits

00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,770
when you have that feeling it's it's the

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,110
feeling of the brain forming connections

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,000
and actually having to do the work it's

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,890
like exercise right walking up a steep

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,420
hill it's good for you but it's not

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,770
necessarily what your brain would rather

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,180
be doing there's there's a natural

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,589
resistance to it so what's what's the

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,350
difference right what's the what

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,240
distinguishes the pleasant sort of empty

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,160
feeling of non learning with the more

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,450
uncomfortable but beneficial activity of

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,900
actually learning and the difference is

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:05,100
effortful retrieval mere exposure to

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,950
information doesn't help your brain get

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,130
better retrieval of information is both

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,890
harder and far more effective so so how

00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:17,190
do you go about making that happen the

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,600
most famous example is teaching people

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,190
have told you before that you don't

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,960
really learn anything until you've had

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,540
to explain it to others

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,760
and if you're not explaining it to

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,040
others explaining it to yourself is a

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,530
pretty good start so just as an example

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,480
I really admire people who write blog

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,410
posts during conferences sort of

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,590
outlining what they've learned from

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,300
speaker I'm

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,410
not very good at this myself I don't

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,700
really get around to it but it's a

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,190
really powerful way of forcing yourself

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:45,070
to restate what you've been given in

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,170
your own words and you do have to use

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,970
your own words you are sort of by

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,620
necessity wrapping this information up

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,810
within the framework of what you already

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,300
know and understand your intellectual

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,339
scaffolding weird metaphor sorry but

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,560
it's gonna be different from the person

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,150
who gave the talk or the book that

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,460
you're reading or whatever if it's if

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,230
it's new to you you won't be able to use

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,700
the same framing or phrasing they did

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,810
and if you do it won't really be as

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,160
meaningful to you because it'll be more

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,380
like you're just trying to memorize the

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,460
words they said you'll become fluent in

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,410
what they said but you're not

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,850
necessarily absorbing the knowledge if

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,080
we're talking about a technology or a

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,580
framework or a programming language or

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,990
something like that you know the sooner

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,120
you can use it for something the better

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,220
right write a hello world write a toy

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,940
project set your sights low and just and

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,560
just use it do the thing using the stuff

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,570
you've learned either to build something

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,500
or explain it to others isn't just the

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,520
most effective way to learn it yourself

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,290
it's really the only way that sticks and

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,180
it's not enough to just do it when it's

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,830
been fresh you kind of have to do it

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,110
later after your brain has been thinking

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,420
about other things and and going

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,100
elsewhere you need to be able to pull it

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,300
back out of memory after it's had time

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:58,870
to sort of fade from your short-term

00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:00,400
case one one highly effective method for

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,780
a spaced repetition and I can't believe

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,700
me to say this is flashcards so taking

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,140
any sort of piece of information and

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,910
turning it into some kind of question

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,620
answer format and making it into a

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,000
flashcard that you then review it's

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,560
actually like a really powerful and

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,589
effective mechanism for stretching your

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,930
brain and the good news about flashcards

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,940
is that it's where tools can actually

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,350
really help right there's some really

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,360
good tools and programs for this and I

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,200
sort of fall into an out of the habit of

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,550
using them but when I do it really helps

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,520
old flashcard programs are great for

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,830
spaced repetition because they work out

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,209
for themselves when you need when you

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,800
need to be retrained on something if

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,720
it's if it's a card if it's a question

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,029
when you're quizzing yourself that you

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,050
get quite often it's easy it won't show

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,490
it to you very often but if you keep

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,810
getting it wrong it'll show to you more

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,310
often until you start to get it and

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,010
you kind of get this double benefit of

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,630
writing writing your own cards forces

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,790
you to reframe the understanding and

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,070
explain concepts to yourself and then

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,680
the spaced repetition helps get it into

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:06,260
your head in a way that'll stay there

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,760
longer so if you're trying to learn and

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,290
you're not really using this these

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,320
techniques and forcing yourself to

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,610
retrieve information it's kind of like

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,560
having a backup system that you've never

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,760
run a test restore on you you might as

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,279
well just be like writing all your data

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,860
to death now and you won't know that

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:25,700
it's all being sort of cast into the

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,700
hole until it's too late

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,830
so not long after seeing this talk after

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,690
a little while being unemployed and kind

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,310
of just having the rare privilege of

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,370
getting to take a few months off

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,560
I got a contracting job and the job was

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,570
to document a whole bunch of Ruby on

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,120
Rails projects they were being migrated

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,740
from the vendor who had wrote them to an

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,620
in-house team that was taking over and

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,020
the rails projects were all in-house

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,600
api's they had a lot of business logic

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,790
and processes implemented in them that

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,620
weren't thoroughly codified outside the

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:13,380
developers heads there were 28 of them I

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:19,199
didn't know Ruby I had four days before

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:20,100
the contract started so so four days is

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,990
not long enough to learn a programming

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,970
language right okay that's that's not

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,319
really feasible but I just been reading

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,660
all this stuff about how we learn I've

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,250
been inspired by Allison's talk and sort

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,540
of the idea that there's no upper upper

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,580
limit to what we can learn as long as we

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,010
can incorporate it with private

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,620
knowledge right so prior knowledge so so

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,050
why not right so here's what I did

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,510
I got these two books and they're both

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,980
they're both like big fat O'Reilly style

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,630
text books like this there's a lot of

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,130
material in these two books there's a

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,450
sort the sorts of text books that just

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,770
kind of usually sit on my shelf for

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,240
years waiting for me to read them just

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,240
kind of looking at me accusingly

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,530
um I grabbed I grabbed like my Pomodoro

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,820
app on my phone which for people who

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,380
aren't familiar it's just like a time

00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,850
management trick where you start the

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,630
timer and let nothing distract you for

00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,280
25 minutes take a five minute break

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,050
and then single-task again for 25

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,140
minutes and you just loop until you fall

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:11,600
over and I sat down and I read both

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,610
books cover to cover front to back I

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,960
pretty much just tried to inhale the

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:20,510
whole the whole thing while I was

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,670
reading I was doing a couple things I

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,230
was trying to find bits of information

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,270
that I could restate into the kind of

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,190
question-and-answer format that I could

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,170
make into a flashcard to sort of help

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,460
myself remember it and that went really

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,780
well at first I didn't actually keep

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,920
that up for very long because it would

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,660
be like a paragraph like oh that's

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,980
interesting and then 10 minutes making

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,440
the car and I was just not making enough

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,330
time so I I made a good start on that

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,350
and I didn't really continue the other

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,910
thing that I was doing when I was

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,100
reading these books was trying really

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,720
hard to restate everything I was reading

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,060
to myself in terms of what I already

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,710
understood pretty well right so I don't

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,810
know Ruby and I don't know Ruby on Rails

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,340
but I know my way around both Python and

00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,230
Django well so I already had a pretty

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,180
good framework to understand the sorts

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,460
of problems that they're solving and so

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,980
I spent my time saying things to myself

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,140
like oh yeah that's that's the same as

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,430
Python cuoco I get that or or oh that's

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,270
that's different from how you do it in

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,960
Python in Python you do this instead and

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,510
occasionally I'd come across something

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,460
just completely insane that I had

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,110
absolutely no reference for in Python at

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:23,450
all and and that would make it sort of

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:25,370
standout in its own way so for the

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,160
record though there was also an awful

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:31,960
lot of oh wow that's really cool I wish

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,960
we had something like that in Python

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,770
okay so these books were pretty big

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,540
right like I didn't make a careful and

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,820
thoughtful considered pass through the

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,920
whole thing I got tired I got sloppy I

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,600
skimmed paragraphs I missed bits but I

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,060
did actually make it all the way through

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,440
the books I didn't expect to know the

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,700
whole language coming out of this and I

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,440
and I didn't right I don't think I'd

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,810
have been any use at writing Ruby code

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,660
but three things did happen that were

00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,520
kind of cool the first was that I just

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,370
simply that I got a lot more out of it

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,900
than I expected to to be honest I think

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,850
because I had been quite careful about

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,720
restating all the Rubies stuff in terms

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:11,520
of the Python that I already knew I said

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,810
I probably couldn't write a ruby project

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,010
from scratch but at least at this point

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,030
I kind of knew my way around reading

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,860
them pretty well it helps of course that

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,450
Python and Ruby are conceptually really

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,830
similar the background that I had in

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,690
sort of high level languages and

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,390
object-oriented programming stuff meant

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,340
that meant that Ruby had more places to

00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,220
fit in my brain alongside what I already

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,690
knew the second thing that happened was

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,550
that there was a really useful sort of

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,980
recency Association thing going on that

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,120
I didn't expect I'd see something I

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,560
didn't understand and the code that I

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,410
was reading and I'd sort of think to

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,970
myself hey I remember reading something

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,730
about that while I was wolfing down that

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,380
packet of Tim Tams before lunch and and

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,600
and so that must have been in sort of

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,750
earlier part of the book and here it is

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,060
right so so while I still had a ways to

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,430
go to learn the language I'd also I

00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,800
learned the books pretty well so I I had

00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,090
I had an understanding of the map of the

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,720
language that I could use as a reference

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:11,490
and there was one other really powerful

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:14,190
benefit that came out of this the the

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,520
binge learning of an unfamiliar language

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,470
but also just sort of spending five

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,540
months in the Ruby world amongst Ruby

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:25,440
developers absolutely and unequivocally

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,440
made me a better Python developer and it

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,230
also finally killed in me the last

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,390
vestiges of the language tribalism that

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,950
I've been harboring my entire career and

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:41,760
I realized that every time I was sort of

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,560
shying away from another language or or

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
dissing another language I was I was

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,779
only ever really sort of depriving

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,919
myself and above

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,639
opportunity to learn something

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,619
interesting okay so speaking of which

00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:56,299
let's talk about the other ways we can

00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:56,299
kind of screw things up for ourselves I

00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,729
guess this is this is a little bit

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,549
introspective this is a little bit

00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:03,690
personal

00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,759
growing up I was kind of an earlier

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,139
early reader I was I was geeky I was

00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,759
playing with computers from a young age

00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:14,429
I was I was the smart kid and so here's

00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,690
the thing when you think you're smart or

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:18,029
when you've been told that you're the

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,919
smart kid your motivation tends to be

00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:22,859
getting opportunities to show off that

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,109
you're smart and you also tend to get

00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:29,609
really good at avoiding the things that

00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:31,349
might make you look not smart so when I

00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:32,789
was a teenager I moved from the the

00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,489
rural school where I'd been growing up

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:38,460
to to a much larger school and and lucky

00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:41,039
me because I was the smart kid I got put

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,960
in the advanced class and and suddenly I

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,440
was sort of surrounded by high achieving

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,029
talented peers a lot of whom had known

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,649
each other for years they'd all grown up

00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:51,029
together they got along well and they

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:53,669
they pushed each other towards

00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,629
achievement and I did not rise to the

00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:59,609
challenge gracefully

00:22:54,629 --> 00:23:02,070
I found myself checking out I became

00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:05,809
disinterested surly and hostile and I

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,299
hated it and I hated school right and

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:12,659
this this new sort of environment did

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:16,049
not inspire me to increase my effort to

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,339
meet the new challenge I had always

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,799
thought of myself as a smart kid and

00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,809
sort of without realizing it I had

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,609
internalized this belief that that

00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,249
effort is what you need it if you

00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:28,289
weren't talented right because if you

00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:34,259
were talented it shouldn't be an effort

00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:35,940
right I didn't know that there was a

00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,359
name for this until Allison described it

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,979
in her in her QE PyCon talk so a

00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,200
Stanford University professor named

00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:49,320
Carol Dweck would have described me as

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:52,109
having a fixed mindset the term fixed

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,119
mindset refers to a set of beliefs a

00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,789
person can have about their own

00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,700
abilities and people with a fixed

00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,289
mindset believe to allergic

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,169
and that a person's capabilities are

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:05,490
sort of preordained they're hardwired it

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,860
might you they might think its genetic

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,840
or doctor upbringing or whatever but but

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,070
they tend to believe that it's more or

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,409
less out of your control you sort of

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,179
either have it or you don't and and you

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:18,269
hear the language of the fixed mindset

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:20,130
all day every day all around you it's

00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:22,289
it's pervasive like you you hear about

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:25,440
how someone is gifted right you hear

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:28,230
about how someone is is a natural you

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,269
hear about the 10x developer right and

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,100
and it's not all positive either like

00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,630
you hear you hear how some people can't

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,460
hack it some people just don't have what

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:40,950
it takes or every every every stereotype

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,289
involving gender or ethnicity is just

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,000
dripping with this kind of fixed mindset

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,980
judgment right it's it's something that

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,470
you hear all the time everywhere all

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,840
around you it's really hard to avoid the

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,750
the converse to having the fixed mindset

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,289
is described by by Dweck and sort of her

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,970
theories as growth mindset and the

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,100
growth mindset is characterized by the

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,010
belief that your your basic ability and

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,799
your aptitude can be improved with

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,889
effort that talents can be built through

00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:13,320
hard work and people with a growth

00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:15,090
mindset tend to be focused on sort of

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,580
self-improvement and unconcerned about

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:22,950
judgment they tend to see failures and

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:25,440
obstacles as motivating failure to me

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,840
was was always kind of a strong source

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,360
of anxiety right or or actually more

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,309
often a source of apathy because I'd

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,950
sort of just tell myself no I didn't

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:36,149
really care about that i III wasn't

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,909
interested in doing that anyway I'm not

00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:40,740
gonna bother rather than sort of admit

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,000
to myself that I did care and risk the

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,019
thought that maybe I just didn't measure

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,799
up this research the the research in the

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:51,510
mindsets is fascinating and over the

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,159
past few decades a compelling amount of

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,409
evidence from sort of independent

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,200
researchers has shown that the mindset

00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:00,120
you hold can have a really strong effect

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,340
on your ability to handle obstacles and

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,899
setbacks in your life for your career or

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,049
your schooling or your academia

00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:08,669
everywhere people with fixed mindset

00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:10,950
beliefs sort of tend to avoid challenges

00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,240
and and they don't recover as well from

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,239
disappointments and this has been

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,830
measured in a lot of settings

00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,419
even even the smallest sort of external

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,850
cues can sort of start you thinking with

00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,889
a certain mindset it's as simple as the

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,070
praise given to a child right like wow

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:27,570
you drew that you must be very talented

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:32,940
versus wow you drew that you must have

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:34,649
worked so hard on that the research has

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,940
also shown pretty compelling ly that

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,279
it's the growth mindset that you'd

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,450
rather have it's definitely it's

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,190
definitely the healthier one you're

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,769
you're gonna be better off if you're

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,080
someone who thirsts for hard challenges

00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,840
and and sort of sees failures is only

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,029
temporary setbacks and isn't inclined to

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,859
sort of jump to the conclusion that it

00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:55,710
reflects badly on your value as a person

00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:57,149
and the good news also is that the

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,179
growth mindset is is actually the

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,649
correct one it's literally the one

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,559
that's more descriptive of how human

00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:06,419
brains work your mind is plastic and it

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,850
is shapeable and you really can take

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,409
what you've got and grow it and for

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,259
almost every skill that matters

00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:15,210
particularly in our field there's really

00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:21,419
no limitation to your skills that you're

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:23,129
stuck with so when I first learned about

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:26,840
this stuff I finally kind of had a

00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:29,789
useful vocabulary that I could use to

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,249
describe some of my own quirks and

00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:35,249
anxieties over the years and I

00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:37,679
immediately recognized that a lot of the

00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,480
fixed mindset stuff in myself and sort

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,980
of especially how I'd grown up and how

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,549
I'd sort of thought of myself as as a

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:47,850
teenager and and but I also realized

00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:52,169
that it's not actually so clear-cut I've

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:54,090
noticed that I have a mixture of sort of

00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:56,489
fixed mindset and growth mindset beliefs

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,529
and they've shaped my reaction to two

00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:03,179
stresses and hard challenges in my life

00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:04,830
and it depended on what I was doing so I

00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,570
believed myself to be a pretty good

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,100
Python developer I've been doing Python

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,899
for a long time and in almost every

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,149
professional role I've had that little

00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:14,429
bit special thing of sort of being the

00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:16,409
Python guy or or being the lead Python

00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,570
guy right and I've only recently

00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:20,190
realised that I've actually been quite

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,679
timid about putting myself in situations

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,899
where my abilities might be called into

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,429
question like genuinely working with

00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:26,890
Python developers who just blow me out

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:29,740
of the water

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:32,050
for example right and I definitely felt

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,300
defensive when I sort of struggled to

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,350
understand something when when when

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:43,090
there was something that I just didn't

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:44,920
get like a sink I yeah I I definitely

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,170
has to have some sort of like hardwired

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,870
kind of fixed mindset ideas about about

00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,760
what I can do but weirdly not everywhere

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,890
right so when I started getting

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,890
interested in security I was coming to

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,930
it as sort of an enthusiastic beginner

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,310
and I was excited to learn new things it

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,080
was like a really cool new field I

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,880
hadn't touched before and I was excited

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,680
to be told if I had made a mistake and

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,860
if I had like I always felt like I had

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,200
something new to learn and despite the

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,270
fact that sort of as a field you'd kind

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,740
of assume that the stakes are higher for

00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,510
whatever reason my own personal

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,040
insecurities didn't get in the way I was

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,960
I was far more enthusiastic about being

00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,600
wrong than I was in sort of other fields

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,930
of my craft but I noticed something

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,340
actually I think Katie noticed it if

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,650
you've seen any of my talks where I

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,420
where I talk about a security concept

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,760
you may have noticed that I always

00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,810
introduce myself as as I'm not a

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
security professional I'm not a

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,460
penetration tester I'm just a developer

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,780
who's interested in security I didn't

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,640
even notice that I was doing that but if

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,130
you look at my talks I keep introducing

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,710
myself that way and I think I was sort

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,100
of giving myself implicit permission to

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,690
be a beginner and and to sort of

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:58,480
permission to sort of maybe be wrong

00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:00,370
about things a while ago I started swing

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,440
dancing and I and I really loved it for

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,290
a while I met a lot of cool people and I

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,580
was enthusiastically and goofily bad at

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,520
something in front of a bunch of people

00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,640
which is really really handy skill to

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,080
learn um but after two years I started

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,400
getting really skittish about it like

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,810
that was around the time that I'd been

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,820
doing it for a while I hadn't really

00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,650
progressed beyond being sort of a

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,960
beginner or intermediate and so suddenly

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,700
suddenly I was like I don't really have

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,680
time to go to the classes like like I'd

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,150
love to go but but no I'm too busy I've

00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,570
got this project I got whatever like I

00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:37,090
just kind of I just kind of went away

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:38,110
and I play bass guitar I've played it

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,640
for a really long time and I've been

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,820
stuck in a fixed mindset there for deck

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,730
Cades and I've joked to people in the

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,010
past that like I know most of say 300

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,930
songs but all of very few and that's

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,760
because when I'm playing when I'm

00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,960
playing music I play the parts that I

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,980
like playing right I play the cool parts

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,090
of the song I play the cool riffs and

00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,220
then and then the hard part of the song

00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,080
I think to myself ah let's play

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,290
something else we'll just lose fool

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,120
around play the bits that that I could

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:08,690
sound good and I wouldn't stretch my

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,650
abilities and so more recently as I

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,970
started sort of learning about this

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,680
stuff my musicianship has kind of

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,540
progressed and I started diving in and

00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,920
really finding the bits that I hated the

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,980
bits that I thought I sucked at and

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:23,750
here's a novel idea rehearsing and

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,210
shockingly it actually kind of works so

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,520
I said sitting down sitting down and

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,760
working on a thing that I suck at and

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,900
sucking at it for hours and giving up

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,040
and going to bed and then waking up in

00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,560
the next morning and trying it out and

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,850
nailing it there's there's really no

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,620
better feeling in the world than being

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:47,630
able to do something that you know last

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:50,690
week that you couldn't do okay so why am

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,220
I telling all of you this and what in

00:31:50,690 --> 00:32:03,980
the end is the point that I'm trying to

00:31:52,220 --> 00:32:06,500
make so I noticed the pattern while I

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,600
was exploring these sorts of pieces of

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,820
my life that were important to me and

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,190
sort of what my preconceived notions

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,900
were about my abilities and whether I

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,280
could whether they could grow or not

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:23,360
I noticed the pattern this this fixed

00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,070
mindset stuff these unhealthiest and

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,380
most counterproductive conceptions that

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,570
I had about my own abilities they were

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,060
all in areas that I thought were the

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:36,920
most important for my reputation to

00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:41,770
others all all the areas where I want

00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:45,020
other people to be impressed by me my um

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,690
my built-in belief system about myself

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,930
has calcified in this way that it's at

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,000
its most inflexible exactly where I want

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,269
to be at my best right where where I

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,649
want to be excellent where I

00:32:54,269 --> 00:33:00,149
where I want to be always growing and

00:32:55,649 --> 00:33:02,429
always learning and the areas where I

00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:04,469
had a growth oriented mindset where I

00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,509
sort of had better healthier attitudes

00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:08,549
to learning we're all in the ones where

00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:09,989
I sort of felt safe messing up because I

00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:15,599
kind of felt like I was perceived as a

00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:17,549
beginner in those areas anyway so I mean

00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,739
like everybody right I have this kind of

00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:21,089
image that I want to project to the

00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,649
outside world like check out my pretty

00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:24,719
suit that I wear when I'm when I'm when

00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:29,279
I'm speaking I don't wear this

00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:30,719
day-to-day I wear it now um so that

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,099
image might not intersect with what I

00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:35,070
believe about myself but it's always

00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,349
nice when it does and what I've realized

00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:39,149
is that I've been the least equipped

00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:42,089
kind of emotionally at least to sort of

00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:44,789
to put myself in that vulnerable sort of

00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:47,099
beginner's mind when it comes to exactly

00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,109
the things that might be of most benefit

00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:52,139
to me either professionally or

00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,570
personally because never wanted to be

00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:58,829
seemed to be like a failure at what

00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,479
matters to me right so I'm telling you

00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,399
all this because I suspect I'm not the

00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:05,729
only person who's fallen into this trap

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,409
over there over their lives and I think

00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:10,829
that recognizing it is probably a damn

00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:11,819
good first step to fixing it so at the

00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,649
start of this talk I told you that I've

00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:15,329
been feeling dumb in my current job and

00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,740
for what's actually the first time in my

00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,089
career I'm sort of working directly with

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,919
Python developers who've been doing this

00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,020
for longer than I have and better than I

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,429
have and and and there's a part of me

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,869
that's still that sort of

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,490
fourteen-year-old boy joining the

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:28,049
advanced class at school and realizing

00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,399
that there's like so much to learn even

00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:34,200
when I when I thought I knew it all

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:36,990
right so that that part of me is is just

00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,250
gonna keep on squawking right but but I

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,720
can learn to recognize that it's

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:44,029
actually not being helpful and I am

00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,230
learning so goddamn much right now so

00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:50,849
here's here's what I here's what I need

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,010
you to sort of take away from today the

00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:55,589
effort of learning is not actually that

00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,140
comfortable feeling if you're feeling

00:34:55,589 --> 00:35:03,750
comfortable it's a warning sign that you

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,549
might not be learning and the belief

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,550
that you're either inherently good at

00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:10,220
something or inherently bad at it

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,710
is utterly toxic to your ability to

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,490
apply the focused effort that is always

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,360
required to improve at something and so

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:24,130
here's what I hope that you'll be able

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:31,010
to do find what makes you feel dumb

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:34,610
right and and find a way to build

00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:40,760
yourself a safe place where you can be

00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:42,140
strategically dumb because every time

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,730
you manage to push at those boundaries

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,970
you're gonna be able to grow at

00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,570
everything you do

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,570
thank you so much for listening

00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:07,880

00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:24,289
presents and we need to pose for a quick

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:24,600
camera here we go thank Tom one more

00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:32,250
