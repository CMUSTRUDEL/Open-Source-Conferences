alex is going to introduce himself

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:12,290
because he can do a much better job at

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:17,100
it than I can so Alex hi everybody I

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,240
will see you all in 150 slides so can

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,039
you see everything ok good my name is

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,630
Alex and some people will let me do a

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,670
talk here at PyCon and so here I am I

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,320
used to do security instead of

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,070
responsible essien but lately I've been

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,630
doing red teaming which is like

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,850
sponsored crimes and it's been really

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,640
fun and today I'm gonna talk to you

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,559
about some things I'm also I also I've

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,570
also agreed to like help organize this

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,980
conference I called purple cone and I've

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,770
agreed to help organize it because I'm

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,350
young and invincible recently no

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,190
recently a few years ago now some I

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,530
write about some like crimes that I did

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,390
and some people with some journalist

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,250
wrote about that blog post and they said

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,010
Oh according to a blog post by a hacker

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,960
who goes by the name Alex and they put

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,080
it in quotes and so out this is my house

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,790
was my real name also and so so this is

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,820
my this is my hacker name now um you can

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,170
call me that I can't stop you I'm about

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,760
to talk about I'm talking I'm about to

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,140
talk about hacking my friend like a real

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,330
friend like an actual friend of mine

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,850
he's like a real person and not made up

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,140
and so like in case any of you having

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,720
the genius idea that you should hack

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,860
your friends um don't do that you it's

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,180
not good it's not a good thing to do the

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,560
only reason it's okay that I did it is

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,540
because I explicitly asked them like

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,250
DK's it okay if I try and hack you do

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,689
you understand what it means why get you

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,159
sure you want to take the risks and so

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,770
on and so on and this person said yes

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,880
anyway this is my friend Anna yeah

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,590
that's not a real name that's not a real

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,350
picture this whole thing is like a lie

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,640
but it's what it's not a lie that she

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,960
really did say it's okay for me to try

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
and echo and explain what all that is

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,710
and so some things about her that you're

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,790
gonna need to know is that she's a

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,840
comedian that's her job

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,729
and she's sweet and young and like tech

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,930
literacy is normal she like all of you

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,090
people here at PyCon probably know more

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,259
about technic imputed sin cheetos she

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,680
knows the normal man for someone her age

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,880
and so I like for some reason she said

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,619
yes by the way she was like the first

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,700
person I asked and I was ok but ok if I

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,259
try and hack all your stuff and she was

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,090
like yeah and I was much easier than I

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,090
thought it would be and so I made some

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,290
rules about like ok

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,840
well there's no just gonna be no rules

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,370
maybe it so what what what constraints

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,870
is we gonna have and so I have 12 months

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,459
to do it I can do any time in the 12

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,410
months I'm not allowed to delete

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:25,330
anything so I'm glad to add stuff and

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,830
look at stuff but no I was like what if

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,660
I deleted your emails and she was like

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,959
oh that would be bad okay you can't do

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,569
that

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,700
and I also I'm not allowed to disrupt

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,720
her daily life so this means like if I

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,549
were to lock her out of her email

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,530
account by life changing the password

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,360
then that'd be bad because she needs her

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,610
email account to like do things cause I

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,989
was to like I don't know spend post

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,819
stuff on her Facebook wall then like

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,739
that would be bad because she'd be like

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,810
distracted by that it's a like not like

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,630
interrupt or inconvenience her because

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,739
she's my real life real friend also I've

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,579
decided that I'm just gonna do this

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,530
whole thing without getting caught

00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,599
because that's what okay to disrupt it

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,340
sounds like anyway and also I'm not

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,650
allowed to exploit the fact that I know

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,819
her in real life so I can oh like email

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,890
address and phone number and where she

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,480
lives and all this stuff I'm gonna not

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,629
use that information I'm gonna do it as

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,099
if I was a real hacker okay oh so that's

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,329
right this talks about operation the way

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,129
do you love the picture we do at the

00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:18,190
beginning you might be wondering why is

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,420
this called operation Luigi in the

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,690
interest of time let's get straight to

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,190
it

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,329
the first thing we have to do is find

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,290
out what our email address is even

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,660
though we already know we have to find

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,450
it and so I was like okay well I'm using

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,920
this advanced hacking software okay just

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,599
put her name into it and the word

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
LinkedIn and LinkedIn just tells me

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,959
here's what her email addresses because

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,459
LinkedIn encourages you hey put your

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,190
email address on LinkedIn so people can

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,450
find you people like me not really

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,430
mostly recruiters but also people like

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,780
me I noticed it's a hotmail email

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,889
address that I'm like oh maybe this is

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,500
wrong maybe this is old

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,349
cuz like no one's easy hotmail still are

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,829
they and so but so then I went to a

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,419
Twitter

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,040
I wanted to know whether this was oh

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,410
really my main email address

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,299
I went Twitter and if you try and reset

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,370
your password on Twitter it will say

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,810
sure you can reset your password we're

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,099
gonna email a link to and then it will

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,019
give you most of the email address so

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,540
give you a few letters and the domain

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,130
and I was like cool this means this is

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,530
this means not my one is a current email

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,780
address weird people whether she's still

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,760
using a hotmail address but okay also

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,329
this is screenshot as old this doesn't

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,560
happen anymore

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,120
Twitter doesn't let you do this anymore

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,620
right if you go and really if I thought

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,450
on Twitter right now it'll be like sure

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,010
you can reset your password type in the

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,180
email address that you use to log into

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,389
this Twitter account tell us the email

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,879
address and then we'll give you

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,770
presumably to prevent this so good stuff

00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,509
Twitter okay so now if you get a phone

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,280
number I think by the way I'm not this

00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:36,169
is my first time like hacking someone

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,490
anything and so I'm like I don't really

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,199
know what I'm doing but I've seen how

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,979
people do it at conferences so I'm like

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,960
I think I just need to collect

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,029
everything that can be collected about

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,729
this person first then somehow it'll

00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:49,189
somehow hacking happen and so I'm like

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,599
okay he's okay I got an email just

00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,949
enough with the word phone into my

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,810
advanced hacking software I've actually

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,830
obscured the name of backing surfer so

00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,080
you can't tell which one it is because

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,060
it's so powerful and so I do this and

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
it's like a page and just says like hey

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,189
do you want to sign up to this club

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,349
because she's like the header of some

00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,000
sort of club and says contact ana at

00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,139
this email address this phone number cuz

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,639
like she just put it on the on line

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,110
because she wanted to be found and so

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,400
like this was not I'm not saying she's

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,750
dumb or bad for doing this this is

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,310
totally normal right you have to have

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,469
some sort of privacy trade-off if you're

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,550
going to like advertise yourself which

00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:21,969
is what you need to do if you're

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,990
organizing a club or anything so like

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:24,949
well what can you do about that right if

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,210
you want to organize a club you got to

00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,719
put some sort of content information on

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,939
the Internet

00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:31,370
works for me and so now I'm like okay

00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:32,960
what do I do have the have the him out

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,680
dress in for a number what do I do now

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,879
okay maybe I should I went to a lot of

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,139
conferences and they say you have to

00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,819
email someone a word document with

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,930
macros in it and then I click the macros

00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:43,580
and then you have control of the

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,939
computer and I was like okay well I

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,020
don't know how to do that also did she

00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,240
even have all I've taught me we just

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,259
have a phone also like if I got control

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,000
the computer then what would I do that

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,349
what would I would probably just try and

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,310
get her browser cookies and log into a

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,569
cloud stuff anyway

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,069
so maybe I don't actually want control

00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,589
of a computer maybe I won her like I

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,879
like email and passwords and stuff and

00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,240
so ok I'm not gonna do this this is too

00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,949
hard

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,509
maybe I can just maybe I'll try and hack

00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,460
into email first and then I can decide

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,639
what to do because email is kind of like

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,139
you know the the the keys to the kingdom

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,399
sort of the top of everything if you can

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,319
act cliff you can get in someone's email

00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,759
then you can use it in order to reset

00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,990
their Twitter and reset the other stuff

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,580
and get into other other accounts I'm

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,930
gonna try and go for that this is what

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,270
this is what I justified this to myself

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,469
it was late at night whatever okay so

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,060
now I have to get her email password

00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:28,520
note that I can't get into her email any

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,990
other way I have to actually know her

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,639
email password and type it in and log in

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,080
at the same time as her because if I got

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,399
into an email any other way by

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,139
pretending to be here and resetting it

00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,800
she would get kicked out of it so she

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,750
has to also still be in a memo and all

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,830
know that I haven't also any email so

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,360
the only way I can do this is by just

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,340
get in the password which is where I'm

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,220
trying to do there's this great website

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,289
for getting passwords called hammer

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,780
being owned owned a lot of controversy

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:53,909
on how to pronounce that and you let's

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,069
you put in an email address and we'll

00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,319
tell you which of the like public data

00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,940
breaches they're cold that email address

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,280
appears in so you can put in your email

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,919
and it will tell you yeah like LinkedIn

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,120
got hacked in 2012 and your email was in

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,560
there so some hacker has your LinkedIn

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,669
password and will tell you that for all

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
the different sites that have been act

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,349
that they want all the different ones

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,490
that this Web site knows about clever no

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,469
where does it say that you need to put

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,960
in your email address so very cleverly I

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,840
put in her email address and I find that

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,120
she's in at the time of writing she was

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,379
only in she was in a few the only

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
interesting ones were patreon and tumblr

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,740
page own didn't have passwords tumblr

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,560
was the only one that had passwords in

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,210
there like debrief thing okay cool I

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,409
know my friends like password it's on

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,500
the internet now I know it's on this

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:40,830
it's in this tumbler great thing this is

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,940
great so now the tumblr password dump is

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,669
something that I just happen to have

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,099
lying around and so it looks like this

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,270
it's a big text file and it's just got

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,250
the email address and then a colon and

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,870
the password hash and hackers are not

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,729
very good at documenting their stuff and

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,960
so they don't really say what kind of

00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,759
password hashes they are it's a text

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,259
file I looked around the internet and

00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,940
people seem to think that they're shy

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,550
want hashes for the static so am i cool

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,099
what does that mean and so let me

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,560
explain what a static salt is so imagine

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,050
you're like I don't know a website let's

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,240
call them tumblr and you're storing like

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,039
emails and passwords this is one way you

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,289
could do it you could store the email

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,550
address of the person and you could also

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,779
just draw their password because then

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,800
when they log in you know whether they

00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,389
typed in the right password cuz you have

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
the password but then you go to a

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,490
security conference and they tell you

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,259
you know glad to do that

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,419
so okay actually you know hash the

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,379
passwords so this way you don't store

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,729
the password you stole this like

00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,080
scrambled up version over it and then

00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:32,880
you can think you don't have to chip and

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,110
you don't have to keep a copy of the

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,310
user's password but you can still check

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,199
whether they type the right password in

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,699
so okay now inserting the password

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,990
hashes and you're like am i doing it now

00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,849
then people that security conferences

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,589
are like no it's not good enough you

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,020
need to do this salting thing now and so

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,010
now you need to before yes before you

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,779
hash the password you need to add a

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,399
random string to the end of it just in

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,840
case somebody has a big list of the hash

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,270
of every

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,530
possible like a character string that

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,210
they could possibly use that to like

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,710
reverse what your hash was back into the

00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,660
password so you have to add this salt

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,400
thing at the end and say yeah okay okay

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,510
and so now you're adding this soap and

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,190
you entered all the end of the passwords

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,870
like this this is called a static salt

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,020
and static means it's the same for all

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,040
the passwords and so now you're adding

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,570
the same thing to the end of every

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,610
single password and the point of this is

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,040
to prevent somebody with a big list of

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,840
the hash of every single string from

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,300
using that big list to reverse your

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,980
password hashes but do you see the

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,690
problem here the problem is that these

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,220
two these two users have the same

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,170
password and because we're adding the

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,480
same thing to the end of the password

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,860
the same stat the same static so the

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,510
thing that's getting hashed is the same

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,920
throughout these people in fact they're

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,510
gonna have the same password if and only

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,190
if they have the same password hash and

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,390
so even when we hash everything you can

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,860
see these two people these two users

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,520
have the same password hash you don't

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,870
know what it is

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,740
you don't know what the password is but

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,800
you know these two people have the same

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,180
password because anaesthetics old thing

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
so why am I telling you all about the

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,940
aesthetics old thing it's because I

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,470
don't know what the stuff is for the

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,580
tumbler password dump even those the

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,140
salts not going to be a secret thing

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,050
it's meant to be like public it's meant

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,980
to be as public is likely user names but

00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know what is because it's not

00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,780
included in the text file because

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,350
hackers are not good at documenting

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,850
their stuff so okay I really want to I

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,480
really want to get my friends password

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,260
out of this but I don't know how and so

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,430
the first thing I did when I had the

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,250
list was I searched for my friend's

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,870
email address and I'm like okay email

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,580
address I'll get all the wines that have

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,440
email address it which is just the one

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,790
with a Bravo - in it am i cool but I

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,770
don't know what this don't know what

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,650
this password hash goes to I don't know

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,020
what password this password hash is of

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:29,120
so here's a sneaky thing I do I search

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,100
for her password hash in the file not

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,860
her password just air password hash like

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,940
an absolute madman because but what do

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,220
you think weapon what do you think we

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,230
happen when I type in her like my grip

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,670
for hustler - it should just be one like

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,830
it should just be her line right you

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,600
just have my friend Ana's thing it's

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,880
like 20 people who have the the same

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,260
have the same password hash right and

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,130
these people is like a little password

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,200
book club right they can all get along

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,850
these least fun they found a little book

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,440
enthusiasts all have the same password

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,390
on tumblr and so this tells me a few

00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,950
things probably it's not a very good

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,050
password since all these people have

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,580
thought of the same one but again I'm

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,050
very smug but I don't know what it is so

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,840
I need to find out what it is and so

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,520
here's what I do I get just the email

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,540
addresses of those people in the

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,130
password book club I throw away the

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,390
password ashes then I know what to do

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,070
with the hash just get those email

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,840
addresses these are all the people who

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,010
have the same password as Diana and then

00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,590
conveniently do you know that LinkedIn

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,420
was also hacked in 2012 and danezaa

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,280
vaneau is not in this list because she

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,870
didn't have lead in 2012 but lots of

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,700
people were and thanks to the hard work

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,380
and GPU cycles of people in the password

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,850
cracking community almost all those

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,620
LinkedIn passwords are in plain text now

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,570
they're not just hashes their emails and

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,150
like you know just passwords you can

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,500
just look at with your eyes and I was

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,740
like wow and also just happen to have

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,390
that lying around and so then I did this

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,070
thing where I looked up the same people

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,830
who in the past my book club in the

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,080
tumbler list in the LinkedIn list and I

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,510
found most of them not all them about

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,400
80% of them had the same password as

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,480
each other on LinkedIn as well so isn't

00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,890
that really sweet that their book club

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,740
transcends like services and I have a

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,720
suite and I found that most of them had

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,400
the password QWERTY 1 and so this is a

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,100
bit of it there's a bit of like a bit of

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,840
a jump here I'm guessing that my friend

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,920
Diana has the same password I don't

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,450
think people on tumblr ok I'm not

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,290
guessing that's definitely true and then

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm guessing that they all have the same

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,400
password on LinkedIn and then I'm

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,570
guessing that that password is this most

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,770
frequent one that's quite a QWERTY one

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,690
thing I'm guessing that that's Danny's

00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,880
password and I'm like okay I've done it

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,600
let's go QWERTY one times fast word I

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,430
did it I'm hacking

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
let's go it's time to use this thing I

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,430
gotta hop me I'll type it in and it's

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,900
not the right password like that photo

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,780
out my password it was that was it

00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,110
wasn't it I was like well damn why did I

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,390
do all this work why did I go to all

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,670
these great lengths okay whatever

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,200
so then I go to Facebook and I don't

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,230
just try it on hey I tried on everything

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,490
I got a face broke and it says I don't

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,440
know that's my Facebook password but

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,630
it's an old password it was your

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,760
password about five months ago now I'm

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,370
like oh thanks Facebook for taunting me

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,720
I guess I'm too late

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,100
but I mean like okay so this did used to

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,540
be a password she just happens to have

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,370
changed it recently and I've somehow

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,589
stumbled upon the person who has more

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,110
than one password in their life okay

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,880
fine I guess we just the hard way but I

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,130
didn't want to have to do so by the way

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,780
this this is what I had planned this is

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,430
what I thought this like hacking would

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,930
be like I was gonna be like hi it's so

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,800
easy to hack someone you just look them

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,360
up and all these lists that you have

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,589
lying around and it's as easy as that

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,730
and so the rest of this talk will be

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,800
about how it's not as easy as that

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,910
always and so I'm like okay I guess I'm

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,170
gonna try and do this fishing thing I'm

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,490
gonna try and trick her into sending me

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,230
the password because everyone else is

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,460
doing it it's more work it's way more

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,230
it's more work because you have to make

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,060
something custom but like oh well I

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,990
don't know is this how you do fishing I

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,530
don't know it's my first time maybe I

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,530
should be something like this

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:47,040
I don't know you don't know that it you

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,360
don't know that it won't work so no I'm

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,560
not gonna do that I'm gonna do this he

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,120
has a plan to come up with I'm gonna

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,410
send her a fake email from Microsoft cuz

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,820
she has hot mails it has to be Microsoft

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,529
and that email is gonna take you to a

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,639
login screen for hotmail but it's a fake

00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,079
login screen that actually sends me a

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,370
password and then she'll go to the real

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,630
hotmail login screen and just kind of

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,010
keep going as if nothing happened

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,190
this is my plan I don't know don't

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,870
whatever and so um but to do this I'm

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,180
gonna need to make a hotmail account to

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,410
send the email from so i go to i go to

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,500
make a hotmail account which will let me

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,029
open a world of benefits and i try to

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,440
make one that looks like Microsoft I try

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,240
to make a Microsoft account team and

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,250
says no you can't do that presumably

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
because the word Microsoft is in the

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,790
email address and they know I'm not

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
Microsoft and so I try to make my first

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,209
name Microsoft on my last name account

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,790
team and they're like no you can't do

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,410
that and presumably to stop exactly what

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,889
I'm trying to do and fair enough however

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,690
these are my round friends and they're

00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,130
they look like two others dead they

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,320
looks like I put two O's in this slide

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,880
like an absolute fool but actually one

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,560
of them is in home and one of them is a

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,269
Greek letter Omicron which looks a lot

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,319
like a note to you and me doesn't it but

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,149
to a computer they're completely

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:51,269
different like Unicode code points and

00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:54,360
so like if you dispel Microsoft's like

00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:56,970
this with these omec runs then like that

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,819
doesn't say Microsoft but like to you me

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,839
it looks like it does and so like does

00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:03,560
this really work I'm sure you're

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,560
wondering why

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,169
surely like surely the billions of

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,879
dollars at Microsoft and the most

00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:13,299
advanced Mayans I'm gonna be full bite

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,799
no does why I can't does and so I make

00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:16,329
this I make miss Microsoft account team

00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,099
thing and I Center this email which says

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,809
a lot I copied this from like a real

00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:21,009
Microsoft email that I got I copied all

00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:23,139
they're like styling and most of the

00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,819
text and it says oh you better to log

00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:28,029
into your account in the next 48 hours

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:30,849
so we're gonna lock it oh please do it

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,769
oh it's gonna be real bad oh boy there's

00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:36,789
like Russians IP addresses you wouldn't

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:39,849
want that I don't know and so it says

00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:41,769
like coming log in please but again this

00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:42,819
is just an email like that link but that

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,749
don't workers account thing at the

00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:46,059
bottom that has to be a link to

00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,469
something and so I need to make that I

00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,779
need to make a website for that bottom

00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:51,069
button to link to so okay let's go this

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,889
is the real up my login screen oh it

00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,659
wasn't the time and so I'm gonna I need

00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,619
to make a copy of this and so there's an

00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,119
easy way to make a copy of things that

00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:59,919
this hacking tools technique I learned

00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:01,539
about when stuff watch everything this

00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,249
before don't mind if you right-click on

00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:06,009
something except to you hit this button

00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,869
and when you hit that inspect element

00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,749
button that's the good stuff

00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:12,149
I think there are easier ways to copy

00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:14,679
websites but I always do it this way

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,169
anyway so here's my copy of the website

00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,189
it looks the same because it is the same

00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,109
but this time it's on my computer it's

00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:22,569
on localized and so now I need to put it

00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,259
on the internet somehow and so I'm like

00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,549
how do I put this

00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:26,429
I can't leave it to local host how do I

00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:29,259
put this online and I found this like

00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:31,209
static hosting company website thing

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,459
they're not paying me to say this but I

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,689
can they let you like host static files

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,099
on the Internet and this is really good

00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,659
because you get a custom subdomain so

00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,519
you can be anything dot aerobatic dot IO

00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,319
and they give you HTTP for free and it's

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,939
like to command something to do it and

00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,819
no one knows about it so all the good

00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:47,109
subdomains aren't taken so like I'm sure

00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,339
it's a good static hosting site but it

00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,409
happens to also be a really good fishing

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:53,409
hosting site so thank you to these

00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,729
people you can use the promo code Diana

00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,819
to be immediately reported to the

00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,819
authorities

00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:03,439
this is the one I made this is the the

00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:05,000
year the domain I chose the real hotmail

00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,850
logon screen it's log the real hotmail

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,529
login domain is login live.com and so I

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,089
could have like made my own domain name

00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,470
and like made it look even more similar

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,980
but I just don't think that I was gonna

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,839
look at the euro very much because she's

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,019
not like a paranoid security person like

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,120
us but then again for some reason

00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,439
logging when you go to like a login

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,909
screen the Euro doesn't look like that

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,620
it looks like this it has a bunch of

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:33,500
like stuff at the end and so I just

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:34,760
added a bunch of stuff at the end it

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,230
doesn't do anything actually stole from

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,090
the Google logon screen but whatever

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,830
okay it's my first time and so here it

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,299
is this is my fake login screen on the

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,350
internet now I know it's the same

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,750
picture but this time with me internet

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,899
trust me and so I also add these bonus

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,669
features to it the first one is that

00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:54,830
after she clicks the the login button

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:57,200
the submit button it's gonna add an

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,149
image to the page and the image goes to

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,620
a website I control forward slash Diana

00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:02,600
and then question mark and then plus

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,710
whatever her password is so the reason

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,909
I'm doing this is to try and steal

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,500
whatever just trying to steal my

00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:08,330
password this is like a terrible awful

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,029
way to do it he probably shouldn't do it

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,470
was really easy so like I'm gonna get a

00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,200
request to my website and forward slash

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,760
to Anna and then plus some password and

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,679
I don't know what this password is so

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,019
it's gonna be a 404 but then in my logs

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,309
it's gonna be request for a 404 to data

00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,720
and then the password something's gonna

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,830
be looking at my logs for this Diana

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,870
thing and when it shows up I'll be like

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,980
oh that's the glass wood and then I make

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,720
it so that after she clicks the button

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,880
it waits one second and then goes to the

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,230
real hotmail login screen the one second

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,790
way to simulate Australian internet

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,630
speeds

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,680
[Laughter]

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,720
anyway here's the email I send it's like

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,070
you know look out something your Bad's

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,300
gonna happen man you only got 48 hours

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,860
because I'm creating time pressure when

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm doing all the good stuff I've seen

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,460
random phishing emails do then I kinda

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,320
just want this to work so come on good

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,850
click the link and so I send it to her

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,830
and says she and I say she had 48 hours

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,850
and then 24 hours later they nothing

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,770
happened I'm looking at my logs and

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,000
she'd snot there I'm so I'm like she

00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,400
hasn't clicked on it yet and so I'm like

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,780
okay so I sent the email again saying

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,640
like same thing but now you're there 48

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,850
hours and now you have 24 hours you

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,030
better click it and then 48 hours later

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,220
she also doesn't I'm like oh okay

00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,570
alright like at this point I'm not

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,200
actually hacking anyone dirty mailing my

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,520
friend I'm like okay that's a shame I

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,050
guess it wasn't interesting enough email

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,880
and fair enough the thing I learned from

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,770
this is that people don't really care

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,660
about emails from Microsoft or about

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,800
like emails from like like automated

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,560
emails I care about emails from people

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,690
which leads me to the next way I try and

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,190
do this which is like okay she's gonna

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,660
be like on the internet whatever you're

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,820
gonna get an email from a recruiter and

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,350
the recruiter is gonna link her to

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,390
another fake to the same fake login page

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,890
and then you're gonna go to a Google Doc

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,450
and the login page you're gonna make it

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,980
login to see a Google Doc is there such

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,540
but this is Microsoft it's a hotmail

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,130
doesn't have Google Docs is there such

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,690
thing as Microsoft Google Docs and so I

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,130
look it up is this is that a thing is

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,510
that a real thing and there is and it's

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,309
called clouds guys something something

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,670
something something something

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,230
and so I'm like great and so I log into

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,660
this and make oh no I think I make the

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,880
make the document in something else and

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,490
then copy and paste it into this and so

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,660
now I have in Microsoft Google Doc and

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,910
what document I made I made it resume

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,130
like I think fake but convincing looking

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,390
resume and then I send her on it before

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,470
I do that I have to make the person

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,280
who's going to send it to her I can't

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,470
email her for me

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,270
can't email from Microsoft canteen so I

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,540
guess it's gonna have to be from this

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,679
person and so I login screen you know

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,299
you put whatever you want in these boxes

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,860
it's very good and so I make this

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,360
present go to Kathleen wheeler who's

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,710
like a mix of the first name and last

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,320
name from a real company that I found

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,640
and then a sender this which says this

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,450
is me writing this sometimes I'm like

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,179
I'm a recruiter

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,100
I don't know sound like and I'm saying

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,660
hey I work at this company company which

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,820
you care about and which I looked up

00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,710
early on LinkedIn and somebody has

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,360
listed you as a reference somebody has

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,320
told us that you work together like

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,350
somebody had said that they worked with

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,030
you here's the resume tell us how you

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,440
know them click here for the resume that

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,809
link it's obviously the one that goes to

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,190
the fake login screen and then after the

00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,660
lot of text being like can you fill out

00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,710
this form and tell us these things and

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,809
blah blah blah that says to distract

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,549
from the link and then it says also can

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,169
can you lend me a good time to call you

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:06,030
is the phone number her phone number

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,169
which I found earlier okay the reason I

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,460
put a phone number there so she knows

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:09,780
this is like for her a saw like an

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,030
accident like was present and clearly

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,770
knows who she is and then I've made a

00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,970
sweet email signature at the bottom with

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,380
like a different fun and everything I

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,660
thought I was really good attention to

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,150
detail or whatever and so I send this to

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,929
her and it totally works like she clicks

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,370
that she tucks in a password

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,929
it's like the whole thing just works

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,669
flawlessly and I was like wow that was

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,080
really easy and then I look a little bit

00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:29,600
closer and I'm like wait a minute

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,890
this process word that she sent me

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,260
that's query one that I already have

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,260
that one I got Authority that's already

00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:42,160
I was like what that's how could that

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,870
did I do something wrong and then I was

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,010
like no way man here's what I blend she

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,010
does not know how to help me otherwise

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,840
which which which in many ways is the

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,420
ultimate defense against people so like

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,010
don't don't don't shame it for this but

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,300
also because my fake login screen will

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,290
just say yes no matter what possible you

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:07,870
type in actually think this is oh yeah

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:11,440
and I'm like whoops I hope I can fix

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,880
that offenses Oliver anyway so instead

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,260
of giving up an update my login screen

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,640
so now no matter what you type in it

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,770
just says wrong password the first three

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,650
times because my theory is that people

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,640
who like memorize all their passwords

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,140
they just try one and it doesn't work

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,640
try the other one and the other one they

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,460
just unload all their passwords into the

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,780
form and so I also change it so if you

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,860
try it quiet one the counter doesn't go

00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,080
up so you can't describe QWERTY one

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,400
three times so then then I send her well

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,720
then she replies and she's like no I

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,060
haven't work with this person which is

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,290
true cuz I don't exist and then she's

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,640
like yeah you can call me here's that's

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,980
the right phone number and I'm not gonna

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,930
call her because I'm not Kathleen and

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,480
then I'm gonna has the fire being like

00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,680
oops that was wrong residue off for some

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,370
reason you better click on this up this

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,740
makes no sense

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,150
right like like if you think about this

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,560
like if you stop and think about this oh

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,420
there's another person you also worked

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,620
with you around the same time it was

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,970
different dates today and I think you

00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,560
they resume instead of the other but it

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,900
doesn't make any sense right like this

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,580
story doesn't work but it has the same

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,660
like bait of like somebody says they

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,540
know you and you have to click to find

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,980
out who and so I'm like you know please

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,040
please just click on it anyway please

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,480
Diana and you know this time same thing

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,800
happens she clicks on it and gee my

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,570
types in thing he types the same thing

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,210
three times which is this other password

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,200
which looks a lot like 21 also nothing

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,120
 with the real but they're similar

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,230
to what they actually wear those ones I

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,520
shipped it along by one in the keyboard

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,260
I'm like hmm okay

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,420
what's this password and so I got

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,860
hotmail and like using my advanced

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,510
hacking software Google Chrome and type

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,940
the password in without my login screen

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,890
and press enter and it totally works I

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,890
get into email Mike it's as easy as that

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,700
see it's simple okay so then I got an

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,010
email password but now what do I do like

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,020
I tried the same password on everything

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,160
and it doesn't work I'm like great this

00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,410
presents for your passwords in their

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,640
lives and then she replies being like no

00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,350
haven't work with this person either

00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,510
why are you doing this what what's

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,520
happening and I replied just being like

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,010
don't worry about it don't stress about

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,480
it you know I'll just handle it please

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,550
do anyway anymore please just forget

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,710
about this and she does she doesn't

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,050
replying so I'm like great I mean while

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,220
I look into emo and I click on that I

00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,340
want to search from well password so I

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,380
can look into more stuff and so I click

00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,240
on the search bar thing and it shows me

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,320
her last five searches so my cool but

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,210
the last five searches aren't anything

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,950
interesting and but I want to search for

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,150
like password and other things but if I

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,600
do it then you'll see there's in our

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,860
search history right so I write down the

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,930
last five things she searched for and

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,840
then third for all my stuff and then

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,360
search for those things in reverse so it

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,830
looks exactly the same because it only

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,370
shows the last five Microsoft knows what

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,390
I've done but I'm doing anyway and it

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,160
would totally works but I didn't find

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,780
any passwords because I don't know I

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,640
found a lot of passwords already had I

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,540
didn't find any new passwords and I was

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,340
like fine whatever

00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,810
so this is the end of the talk I guess

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,340
that's it I mean or email never believe

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,420
it when it says the end question mark

00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,490
could know it's a novice in at the end

00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,780
geez this talk is called operation this

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,070
talk is called operation Luigi and I'm

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,330
like already in my friend's email you

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,100
know it would be a real shame to just

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,930
kind of leave it at that you know we

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,490
really aim to not like do anything with

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,230
that so here's what operation love Ouija

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,670
is kids we need to do four things get

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,660
into our Twitter second thing is to not

00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,250
lock her out of her Twitter coz she

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,540
needs to be in there too and also don't

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,030
let her know that I'm in their stuff

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,310
they don't know that I'm a nerd Widow um

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,420
so here's how I do it I go to Twitter

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,640
and I'd be like hey I forgot my password

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,780
and total it's me reset it and like you

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,830
know because I mean her email now in a

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,090
second we said the password cuz it'll

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,280
send me the email and I can click it and

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:33,100
I can do that now as I change her

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,100
Twitter password to QWERTY one and so

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,880
that's because this is the phosphor that

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,590
I think she thinks about what is and the

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,450
little the email is my white petal again

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,800
and cuz I need her to log in so I know

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,510
that she's actually type 21 and she's

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,740
back in her and account and I wait a

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,270
while and then eventually she actually

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,770
logs in and I'm like great it was she

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,660
retweeted a picture of a dog and I was

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:53,550
like yes okay so now that I did the

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,280
exact same thing with LinkedIn as I did

00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,050
Widow and I try to change the LinkedIn

00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,400
password to cruddy one as well but

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,690
doesn't let me presume because I got

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,820
little QWERTY won from the LinkedIn

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,750
password dump something no it's bad

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,400
there's a little box at the bottom which

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,900
says require all devices to signing with

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,940
a new password which is like would you

00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,200
like to sign me out on like would you

00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,150
like to sign how all your other devices

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,230
and I'm like absolutely not thank you

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,090
LinkedIn for giving me this option

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,230
unchecked by default so I can just

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,610
change if I swear without even signing

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,520
her out that's why I just do that and

00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,380
then I'll get and so okay now what let

00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,790
me explain so this picture of Obama is

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,890
here because I can't show you Dan as

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,820
real pictures I have to show you because

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,050
I can't show you have real profile

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,250
pictures I'm gonna show you what I did

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,260
to her real profile pictures but with

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,390
pictures of Obama I don't know just go

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,860
with it and so here's what a Twitter

00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,850
picture was and I changed it to be like

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,540
this I don't know if you can tell

00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:41,760
there's like like a load lightly

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,900
transparent Luigi there and so also she

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,020
had a LinkedIn picture and I change the

00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,340
LinkedIn picture to add like another

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,490
can you see it and so I just left it

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,420
there for like I don't know weeks just

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,220
left it there and no one said anything

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,870
okay I thought she might have noticed

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,780
then but this is sort of like proof that

00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,820
I got somewhere and so you know nothing

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,920
happened okay well this is over this

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,670
operation Luigi because not over the

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,450
remainder of this talk will be about

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:08,490
operation waluigi and you know i came up

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,680
with this like a long time ago back when

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,720
this meme was like you know new anyway

00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,550
whatever all we do let's go so I changed

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,180
I changed her LinkedIn bio to be the

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,500
entire Wikipedia page for Luigi and when

00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,529
I do this LinkedIn says her profile

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,460
Frank's is advanced so thank you

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,919
Thank You LinkedIn for being there for

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,799
me dis entire talk anyway I change I put

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,479
it to me this like I want to make it

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,979
super obvious so she'd I want her to

00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:34,090
know that I'm it I want I want to be

00:27:32,979 --> 00:27:35,590
caught now like I'm trying to be cool

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm like hello notice me I'm very loud I

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,489
tweet this from her account just go for

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,129
it and she's online at the same time

00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,809
because it's like 7:00 p.m. and she

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:45,399
replies and she says oMG to this thing

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,080
and she says I've been hacked my dudes

00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:57,489
but then because I'm also looking at the

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:58,359
same time I reply as her saying oh he

00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:00,279
just seemed like the right thing to do

00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,570
at the time anyway the next week this

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,099
then I could wait this I keep doing

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,330
things until she messages me and I treat

00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,950
glowing for the days at this sweet light

00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,389
and keep tweeting things eventually she

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,070
messages me like oh my gosh my Twitter

00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:10,929

00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:18,369
after that she'll all of a sudden you

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,779
waluigi life so much she goes and

00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:22,419
changes her facebook to be a waluigi

00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:24,159
themed even though i didn't touch it

00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,929
she's listen she's like gets really into

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,389
waluigi coach oh i'm not gonna read this

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:32,769
that like she like she like really got

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:34,509
into it and she also asked me like wow

00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:34,989
how do I not get act like how do i what

00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,210
did I do wrong

00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:38,710
like we didn't anything wrong or but

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,729
like this is kind of a question that

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,499
people ask a lot right people ask

00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:42,879
security people like how do I stay safe

00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:44,349
what should I be doing online and these

00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:46,029
are just like regular people who ask

00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,099
this like not security people that is

00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:50,019
like normally ball then a weird like us

00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:52,239
and they say oh how do I stay safe and

00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,469
sometimes the kind of answers are here

00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,269
from security people were like oh you

00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,609
got to do all these things and live in a

00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,719
submarine and never go anywhere and you

00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:02,619
got to get all this advanced

00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:04,809
multi-factor you be keys or whatever and

00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:07,029
so like there are other things you can

00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,009
say you know so Hitler I told her I was

00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,089
like wow listen up to you right like

00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,710
there are things you can do to stay safe

00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,509
there are things you can do do they eat

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,919
like there are things you can do to stay

00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:16,419
safe but they involve investing more

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,529
time and effort it's up to you how much

00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:18,700
you wanna invest is up to you how much

00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,690
you care about this maybe you don't care

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,009
and you find it's getting hacked that's

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,739
okay that's a fella way to live your

00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:27,279
life and so I hope her setup two-factor

00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:28,509
or thorny male because I'm about to do

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,310
this blog post and publish a guide on

00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,380
how to

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,940
and so I don't want to be repeatable and

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,230
so I hope it's a factor oath and I

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,220
should get a code and a phone which

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,600
it'll be would have been way harder for

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,950
me to get passed because it's a way how

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,630
did you get past you factor or theater

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,040
like I don't know fish the to factor

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,750
Oscar door socially engineer the phone

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,250
company too hard and so she was very

00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,300
happy that it wasn't that she was very

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,850
happy that she could just do this and it

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,460
wasn't like much excited for her because

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,320
this is like the lowest effort highest

00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,570
security value thing I think that she

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,860
could have done and so she has a little

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,760
app like this you know you know director

00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,140
what she has this little app and she's

00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,510
like yeah now I can just type in these

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,740
codes these backup codes are kind of a

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,600
trap though and I kind of warned about

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,150
only using the app because and see that

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,590
button that's like you know saved a text

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,150
file will keep these code somewhere safe

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,560
no one clicks those buttons everyone's

00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,450
just like yeah whatever clothes like no

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,740
one keeps these backup codes and so

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,880
that's why it's that's one of the

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,220
reasons it's good to have SMS as a

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,510
backup anyway in conclusion I was

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,080
talking about Luigi for like a long time

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,670
so I hope you liked it and last thing is

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,470
you might be wondering like where did I

00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,270
get the before I was like oh it had

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,680
these lying around every wondering when

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,000
I get there like LinkedIn and tumblr

00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,370
like possible hashes where did it where
