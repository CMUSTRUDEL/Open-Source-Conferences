Hahmann and Burghart estimate at least 60% of all information is geospatially referenced. Fortunately, Django includes a variety of spatial and mapping tools to help build spatially-aware services. This talk will give an overview of geospatial concepts for the Australian and Django communities.

so from geotag photos to driving

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,640
directions being able to handle

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,230
geospatial information it is a

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,780
increasingly important part of a lot of

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,099
web apps Anthony Joseph is a software

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
engineer mathematician and startup

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,150
co-founder he's going to introduce us to

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,320
geo Jango the module built into Jango

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,240
score that lets you add these sort of

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:26,760
capabilities to your app please make

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:28,349
Anthony feel welcome good to go cool

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,779
thank you very much for the warm welcome

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,239
so it's Anthony I'm gonna be giving a

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,340
talk to you about Geo Jango I'll call

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,360
this the travelers guide in the sense of

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,219
like if you're traveling to a new

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,710
country I'm just gonna show you the

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,450
manger sites for the more advanced

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,910
travelers and I show some of the cool

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,020
things to go and try out later on but

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm hoping that it's going to be fun for

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,149
everyone before it gets started I guess

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,440
for me to national guess is where we do

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,710
like to acknowledge the traditional

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,710
custodians being in a mapping based

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,850
uh-hum conference talk I figured I might

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,400
actually show a map circa 1700 and we

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,210
are actually somewhere here which is

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
roughly the gadigal people on the eora

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,210
nation so like to acknowledge their

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,770
elders past present and future also in

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,570
my talk I'll be mentioning a few

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,400
Bendel's I'm just out of conflicts of

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,580
interest I don't I've been a customer of

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,400
some of these vendors but I'm not

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,380
sponsored but in any way but I will take

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,990
tips if anyone has any yeah it's gonna

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,729
be one of those talks just to give you

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,290
an overview I'm gonna just introduce on

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,869
some of them fundamental mapping

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,000
concepts and then kind of work our way

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,040
from the bottom up our stack how we

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
store data how we query it and then

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,560
display it and some of the future

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,770
directions and if I get the time maybe

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,100
some Q&A and unless you want me to be in

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,700
your photos I will post the slide deck

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,750
on the slack Jango Khan channel so y'all

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,190
can go take a look at in your own time

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,050
so some of the fundamentals of mapping

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,510
will go back to the very beginning a

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,180
ladder to your longitude coordinate this

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,989
happens to be the

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,790
the upper house for me it kind of was

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,900
the question of all what is actually

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,310
mean to have a corner latitude/longitude

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,129
so we're gonna dive pretty much straight

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,500
in we have a geographic coordinate

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,629
system is when we so talk aloud she and

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,450
longitude so what that actually means is

00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:37,209
we have a 3d spherical approximation of

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,120
the earth and the latitude and

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,510
longitudes are actually angles from

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,629
essential points by far and large the

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:51,120
most commonly used coordinate system is

00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:54,879
wgs84 world geodetic system this number

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,010
43 62 comes up a bit later so just as a

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,859
bit of a callback for later on just keep

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,069
that in mind so if we were to describe

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,269
you know where we are roughly there we

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,219
would actually have the central point

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,829
here and the latitude longitude would

00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:13,510
actually be the angle to roughly there

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:19,510
and down but there's much better diving

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:21,729
the next slide like that so what are the

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,280
advantages and disadvantages of using a

00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,629
geographic coordinate system well

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,790
firstly there's no distortions that

00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:29,769
that'll come in in a later point of the

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:33,010
next slide and also we can represent

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,979
virtually any point in the world if we

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,150
do want to do analysis on a geographic

00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,370
coordinate system it does become a bit

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,159
more complicated because what actually

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,290
happens is if we had a point here at

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,209
another point here we have to use the

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,459
method of great circle method great

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,579
circles to calculate distance and area

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,900
and that is computationally expensive so

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,780
it can affect things like query

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,759
performance but there's more fundamental

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,790
point of well we've got this 3d

00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,709
approximation of the earth how do we

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,019
display something in 3d in two

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,840
dimensions like a map like a physical

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,109
printer nap or a computer screen da da

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,329
da and the obligatory conference xkcd

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:19,269
comic this is one for every season isn't

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:22,419
there for two in order to actually

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,219
represent a 3d object in a 2d surface we

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,380
would have use a projected corner system

00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,980
the Makeda projections probably one the

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,680
most common

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,620
and probably seen around and there's a

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,300
web-based version called web Mercator

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,140
for the Australian audience here there

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:42,490
is the geodetic geocentric datum of

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:45,310
Australia 1994 1994 sorry it's a top of

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,650
my slide which is probably more commonly

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,140
used ones for representing Australian

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,810
data some of the advantages of this is

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,980
that it's great for displaying on well a

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,170
web map it's also great for analysis

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,180
that comes a little asterisk because the

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,240
analysis will work well if it's within

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,690
the area that actually projecting on so

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,180
if you try it let's use the geocentric

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,390
datum of Australia for another pilot

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,700
world you probably have distortions and

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,690
that can affect the quality of your the

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:23,500
accuracy of your analysis so I was

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,830
actually hoping that figured no subtext

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,370
here with using Canberra in in my slide

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,560
deck here we do have two common types of

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,710
geospatial data of vectors and rosters I

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,190
saw this one of a very ambitious analyst

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,240
in Canberra who and it's cycled around

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,160
Parliament House to kind of create the

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
shape of the Millennium Falcon I thought

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,850
that'd be a kind of a cool thing to

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,710
chose between that or the uber surge

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:53,470
pricing model so I figured what would

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:55,920
the rebellion do those vectors typical

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,840
straight lines that kind of content

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,250
rosters are also used also referenced in

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,590
the documentation as you can imagine

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,990
some bitmap X&Y coordinate with the

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,620
value that corresponds to it in this

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,780
case here this is an elevation model of

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,570
Australia so the value at the XY corner

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,360
would be the relative elevation to

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,250
sea-level I've seen a missional on the

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,290
documentation but I'm still to see like

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,230
people using rosters in anger in a

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,560
production web map since but just for

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,810
completeness I want to include that here

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,150
so some of the data data structures we

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,400
use in vectors we have our standard

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,070
point Lachi longitude all kinds of

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,260
goodness for that we also have lines so

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,780
we'll have you know simple you know

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,000
start and finish point for seeing

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,700
this happens to be the so called lot a

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,050
line I'll go into a little bit later on

00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:52,540
or we can have the my very lousy CD

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,290
deserve time one hour in something

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,060
minutes it's a very high number which

00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,889
can so that's a poly line which will be

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,220
a series of lines connect together to

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,230
create a sound like a path we can also

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,250
have polygons as you imagine any number

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,230
side shape and this happens to be part

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,150
of the City of Sydney federal electorate

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,010
the reason I say partly off because

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,350
that's one polygon and we can also have

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:22,030
multi polygons as it turns out the

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:26,470
federal seat Sydney has both Sydney oops

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,620
Sydney and Lord Howe Island ran a bit of

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,300
trivia for everyone here much like if

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,150
you were to store a floating-point

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,620
number in an integer you pretty much do

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,600
your truncation if you try to store a

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,360
multi polygon in a polygon you will only

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,560
get one of those so that's something to

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,010
really keep in mind I've made that

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,010
mistake before

00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,190
so building on those simple data

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,620
structures I'll just talk a bit about

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:54,010
the analytical concepts that one can use

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,900
so geocoding is one that is commonly

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,390
used so we'll take a street address so

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,000
like 130 George Street Sydney and it

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,080
gives us a latitude longitude reverse

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,940
geocoding as you can imagine is the

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,680
opposite where we give it a latitude and

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,590
longitude and we say well what address

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,410
would this happen to correspond and it

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,940
can be a one-to-many relationship so 130

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,130
George Street happens to the Museum of

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,630
Contemporary Arts so you can get

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,740
multiple results if you are doing a

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:23,919
reverse geocode geolocations another

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,960
commonly used point where we give a

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,390
latitude longitude it's like we get

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,310
given IP address and we get allergy and

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,010
longitude so this can be used say for

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,349
fraud if your custom if a customer's

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,960
connecting to your server like on a web

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:40,450
app and they have an IP address that's

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,890
you know in the US and they're honest

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,160
rayon-based customer that could send up

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,230
a flag in your fraud system we can but

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,180
we can also use geolocation in

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,700
autocomplete so if we are typing in a

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,940
street address and we know our users are

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,330
in Sydney we can suggest them

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,650
any addresses instead of you know

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,070
anywhere else in the world if they

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,770
happen to type in street address we also

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,080
have routing where we would have a start

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,640
and end point so this is the Opera House

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,500
and walking to the Museum of

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,420
Contemporary Arts a nice walk if you

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,470
want to get our stretch your legs during

00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,120
the conference routing will typically is

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,120
like a road network public transport

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,310
data to show how to get from one place

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,130
to another so walking would naturally

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,550
prefer things like pedestrian safe food

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,000
paths to actual roads probably would

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:35,010
avoid people using walking on freeways

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,320
public transport would usually combine

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,170
walking with a public transport

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,750
timetable like you walk out to local bus

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,660
stop catch a bus to party your

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,920
destination and walk the other part

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,500
cycling is an interesting one because it

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,720
can also use road networks as well as

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,760
any bike paths and depending on your

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,050
routing outgoing they can prefer bike

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:02,130
paths over like roads and the obligatory

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:04,560
driving taxi and ride-sharing so

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,640
building up from that we can do spatial

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,780
analysis so on the left is a climate

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,580
forecast model where the representing

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,150
forecasts across well this is actually

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,230
for the world on the map and you can

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,600
kind of get a lot more contextual

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,640
information from that will show you on a

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,500
map and this is the larger line that I

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,800
was mentioning before so what people

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,960
what chief accountant analyst has done

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,780
they've actually looked at relative

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,540
socio-economic advantages and they've

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,980
been able to come up with this line

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:42,810
showing lower advantage areas over more

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,650
advanced it happens to almost divide the

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,610
city and the last console go through is

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,990
isochrones

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:56,220
I saw being same Crone being time ish

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,110
dose be learnin this is how far

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,050
essentially you can travel within a

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,480
certain time so this isochrone happens

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,520
to be some in the middle of Sydney how

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,010
far can we go in 30 minutes travelling

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,360
by public transport

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,730
and you end up with some very

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
interesting at least for me personally

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,280
answers where as it turns of you're

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,750
trying for saying the city we can

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,270
actually go to somewhere near valle Cruz

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,390
which is like probably where a bus stop

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,130
is so you can kind of do some pretty

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:28,320
interesting analysis through isochrones

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,670
so storing geospatial data so this is

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,810
what everyone probably came for probably

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,660
where actually would how she will

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:40,170
restore it there's web services like web

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,240
map services web coverage servers like

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,780
geo servers who host this content for

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,490
you or more likely formats like well no

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,500
texts KML good ol KML from way back when

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,800
geo JSON and a couple of private area

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,800
formats ArcGIS shapefiles MapInfo tab

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,040
files they've tried to standardize these

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,570
with the open geospatial consortium and

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,880
they also have tried to standardize

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,760
database formats for storing spatial

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,390
information so if we take our good ol

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,930
fashioned Postgres database and add G is

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,900
G from a geospatial information systems

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:23,910
capabilities onto it we get purchase

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:27,590
SQLite Plus just equals spatial light

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:31,260
and their spatial extensions from MySQL

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:34,320
Microsoft sequel Oracle even some of the

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,010
know SQL style databases like MongoDB

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,710
have spatial extension so I'm not

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,530
expecting anyone to read this this is

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:46,920
more of a compatibility list of all the

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:50,240
functions that are available to our

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,920
users and what database engine so

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,290
Postgres as you could imagine does

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,170
actually do quite a lot that's not

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,550
working at all well does actually do

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,000
some of the advanced functions but if

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,310
your existing database engine for your

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,780
current products do you know I using the

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,090
other ones you are not limited by that

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:13,320
so just something to keep in mind if you

00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,700
were to start from scratch and if

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,560
remember for we were talking about the

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,660
different data types they happen to map

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,860
very nicely to the different fields in

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,660
our database so a point

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,570
would store in a point field multi-point

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,210
field lines would be stored line string

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:32,890
or multi lines and polygons being in a

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:35,050
polygon field or probably gun field so

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,410
this is where now I'm trying to try to

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,690
call back to period bits my talk if you

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,470
are storing geospatial data by default

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:49,180
it will stored in that wgs84 standard

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,100
that srid 43 62 which that's why I was

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,900
kind of mentioning the number because by

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,980
default or if you want to change it you

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,980
would have to use that number

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,400
it also will create a special index by

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,860
default and another thing that I learned

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,040
during my travels was if you said

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,140
geography equals true what can happen is

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,240
if you are doing distance calculations

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,120
the database engine will make certain

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:19,540
assumptions that normally do and it can

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,680
help with query performance and why

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,440
don't bring up the spatial reference

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,000
systems these SR IDs

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,220
more often than not if you are using

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,720
like a KML so our format of us getting

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,730
data from like some other servers there

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,350
will be in that format if you are

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,540
getting data from official sources like

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,780
the public sector mapping agency one of

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:42,820
the government-owned companies they will

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:44,950
give you data in this GTA 94 standard so

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,860
you will need to do a process called

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,480
reprojection where you convert data in

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:56,470
one projection into another more

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,840
importantly I guess kind of calling back

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,580
to previous talks make sure you read the

00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,320
documentation read the metadata

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,690
associated with the data that you are

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,220
getting because they will answer a lot

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,340
of the questions as a lot assumptions

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,220
are made I also want to talk really

00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,290
quickly about spatial indexes your

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,240
normal database indexes would be

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,510
typically be trees if you said that

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,700
index equals true on that field if they

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,410
do if you do use that spatial index

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,500
equals true you end up with what I think

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,910
is something pretty cool where you will

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,680
have you know letter your polygons

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,410
what'll actually do is it will create a

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,450
bounding box around all the different

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,610
polygons and will store the

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,770
in its index and this can help our

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,260
career performance again so another

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,460
thing to kind of keep in mind if you are

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:48,780
looking to structure your database in

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:53,400
certain way so queering Co special data

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:55,570
everyone loves query sets right what

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,500
just as much as we would do with our

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:02,470
regular query set we will use we just

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,700
substitute instead of our you know count

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,590
or not counts like something like you

00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,840
know amount is less than or equal to

00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,970
some query value we just instead of a

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,430
count we will substitute in a geospatial

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,040
function something like you know

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,830
distance is less than or equal to so

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,170
will be like you know location distance

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,310
is less than or equal to some points but

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,860
I'll go through a couple of examples

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,580
just to kind of show some of the more

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:33,910
common query types you might encounter

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,650
so point in a polygon that's kind of a

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,540
standard query that one might have if

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,320
you have a polygon shape what will have

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,240
created this example of just like a

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,810
suburb I want to kind of find points

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,760
that happen to lie within that so if we

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,850
had a postcode in a boundary that the

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,110
boundary being stored as a polygon field

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:56,800
what we would do is we would have this

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,470
suburb and we'll filter along and the

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,170
boundary happens to contain that point

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,660
so that is one way that we can find this

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,400
point here and this one wouldn't happen

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:14,530
to be in that that point so another one

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,720
is you know within a particular from a

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,449
central point what is within a two

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,829
kilometre or some fixed distance as you

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,800
imagine this might be interesting for

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,780
like a simple web app showing like the

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,180
stores happens to be for like a

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,450
company's website so if you had like the

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,000
location you could say you know is the

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,300
location within whatever the users point

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,480
is and the fixed distance so you see

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,450
we're just using the traditional ORM but

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,820
with the geospatial functions to do

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,559
queries and we're done sets

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,570
nothing I like is also sorting by

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,700
distance so you can imagine what's the

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,520
closest store to accussed where the

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,750
customers located so for this week I

00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,730
need to do something a little bit more

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,460
special like we need to annotate our

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,220
queries so in this case he will annotate

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,760
with the distance of location from

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,950
whatever the location is in our does in

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,190
our particular one to the point and then

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,200
we'll order by that that distance I've

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,150
kind of been really heavily talking

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,340
about distances but there are a whole

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:24,570
bunch of other functions out there for

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:27,090
you so things like length perimeter so

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,470
yeah you can even change the output

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,059
which I thought was pretty cool and I

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:34,860
really tried that yet so that's not the

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,530
actual want to try out in spare time so

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,850
now we've got our data we've found a way

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,990
to store it with find a way to query it

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,400
let's try showing there to our users so

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,250
we've managed to find a way of actually

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,710
storing our spatial data if you actually

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,990
were to display it we normally need our

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:56,610
actual data but we also need a web

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:58,380
mapping library and a base map so web

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,720
mapping libraries typically tend to be

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,720
JavaScript based three examples happen

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,240
to be open layers leaflet or matte box

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,450
matte box actually hired the lead

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,919
developer for Leifer to work on the core

00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,750
products so they've kind of incorporated

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,030
bits about into their mapping library

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,890
and of course Google Maps if you are

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,510
developing for mobile apps there's a

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:24,659
usual lot of the mapping vendors will

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:26,549
have their own SDKs and and we also have

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,080
the base map so this will be the tile

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:31,380
imagery that kind of sits behind

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,240
whatever data you're showing so you have

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,380
graphics like your typical Google Maps

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,190
map box

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,720
Open Street Map arcgis and so on you go

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,070
see your salad imagery digital globe

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,510
seems to be like the world leader in a

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,950
lot of this and a lot of the maps that

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,530
you see will be using digital globe

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,480
imagery near map is an Austrian company

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,210
that does some pretty cool imagery like

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,909
it's very very high resolution very high

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,909
detail so they do some pretty cool stuff

00:19:53,909 --> 00:20:00,080
and the US government like Lance

00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:03,419
and like they're their own Hilah

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,610
low-resolution maybe ones about at no

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,679
cost and they'll come in a particular

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:12,509
URL format that would work with your

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,149
wet-nap library this I just want to show

00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,549
just some of the examples of basemaps

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:20,269
just around the convention center area

00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,740
so this is like the typical Apple Maps

00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:25,470
Google Maps using a satellite imagery

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,529
Google Maps with the regular like map

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,870
view here maps as loosely affiliated

00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:33,799
with Nokia at some point um kind of

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,090
where that happened and that pops that's

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:39,029
some of these mapping engines will let

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,490
you customize the colors customize what

00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:43,980
information gets shown so it's kind of a

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,509
decision for you in terms of what you

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,519
want to use like you want to show more

00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:49,200
data you want to make it accessible for

00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,629
use to unfit your corporate branding

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,889
it's a lot of choice out there to make

00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:55,049
and I'm not going to a kind of recommend

00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:57,450
ones just to show there's actually a lot

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,840
of different ways to show the same

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,649
information so I'm going to kind of try

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,330
a little bit brave here and do a like a

00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:09,600
example here so in this one here we have

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:13,529
our usual preamble just loading you know

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,139
style sheets and JavaScript but more

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:19,799
importantly when we go through we have a

00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:21,870
div that has the map and we can

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,259
obviously size it in whatever way to

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,419
kind of fit our page for this one he

00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,450
would define the map it's using like

00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:33,240
this is using leaflet by the way and we

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,809
were said the original view like where

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,940
it's going to be located and the number

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,950
here the end is the zoom level this is

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,730
how far the map is zoomed in when the

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:48,720
page loads we then load a tile layer so

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,159
this unhappily is OpenStreetMap that's

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,159
that URL that was mentioned before we

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,169
get from our and from whatever map we're

00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,029
using and timming that to connect an

00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,009
attribution the attribution text was

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,710
really really long so I can't just cut

00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:05,389
it short just for this example and then

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,389
we go and add it to the map

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,760
and finally we actually add the marker

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,450
that we wanted to add so got a lot of

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,220
chi long virtue adds map we bind a

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,260
pop-up thing you know hey you are here

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,410
and then open it up and we end up with

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:24,049
something like this not too complicated

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,870
but imagine some of the cooler people

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,850
were asked probably thinking like using

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:32,030
latitude and longitude and isn't that

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,410
the geographic coordinate system they

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,670
mentioned before but that's three

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,980
dimensions and you're showing it on a

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,890
map that's two dimensions so what's

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,080
happening here as it turns out web maps

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,270
will automatically reproject your

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,010
latitude and longitudes to the web

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,559
Mercator projection so they will

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,890
automatically figure it out for you so

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,809
they'll make our lives a lot easier and

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,720
just to kind of bring that all back to a

00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:58,760
close our forms this also forms API as

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,549
well which actually got to copy the

00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,770
previous slide which I'd had the model

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:07,100
API on into the forms one because they

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:11,450
had the same structure and the docs have

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,669
a little bit more in that for you so I

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,780
just want to just kind of wrap up a

00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,030
little bit with some of the future

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,400
directions so if you were if you'd use

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,480
the Geo Jango before some of the cool

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,350
things that had happening in this space

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,380
naturally matter I want to die straight

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,850
into doing like web Maps if you want to

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,580
do some more offline analysis

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,770
QGIS as an open source program that you

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,559
could use to do your analysis before you

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,590
go and write your scripts and the like

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,160
ArcGIS is a commercially available tool

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:46,549
that does very very similar work if you

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,320
are interested in the more data analytic

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:52,700
side tableau and to a lesser extent

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,740
power bi can do that everyone in the Big

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Data space as JIRA Mesa which is adding

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,490
the geospatial extensions to guess the

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,350
Big Data toolkit

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,990
there's also WebGL maps so people are

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:11,750
trying to port the existing tile based

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:13,640
imagery into WebGL so that is that is

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:18,350
something that you can consider as well

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:21,740
if it kind of suits your use case

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,990
there's also mobile things happening the

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,639
mobile space so 3d graphics of people I

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,630
think matte box in particular using

00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:32,899
unity for they're great to show like

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,299
spatial data and also using augmented

00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:36,590
reality virtual reality for things like

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,419
routing so you can have your phone up

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:43,429
and they'll show you which way to walk

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:45,740
up to a to a city another couple of

00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:48,769
things would be open data so we actually

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,899
can you get data from data gobbling you

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:53,960
actually has a wealth of spatial

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:56,120
information out there so it kind of goes

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,769
across various jurisdictions some at the

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,230
federal level some of the different

00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:03,049
states so that's a good source if you

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,269
want to play around with some just some

00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,779
diet just to get just to see how things

00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,509
work

00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:11,269
there is also government data so this is

00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:13,610
still data you might have to pay for but

00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,019
is still curated by the government so at

00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,419
least for the Australian audience public

00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:19,669
sector mapping agency they collect

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,860
things like the road network for all of

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:24,889
Australia they standardize a lot of this

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,830
features across the country things like

00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:30,379
election boundaries a lot of that stuff

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,299
happens at the PSM aid they also do some

00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:35,330
really cool things now with satellite

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:38,929
imagery so they have a new API their

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,370
buildings API where they are you put in

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,590
a largely long tune it says at this

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,879
large your longitude here happens to be

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,190
there happens to be a building it has a

00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:48,110
swimming pool this much this much green

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,080
area around it so they're doing some

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,659
pretty cool stuff there and if you want

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,259
to use commercial data there is for the

00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:01,490
geo geo location that happens to be max

00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:03,590
mind and IP geolocation but my one

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,940
advice be checking licenses some of the

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,700
open data is like Creative Commons

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,710
license we have my attribute or might

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,509
not be for commercial use so just keep

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,389
that in mind nothing is happening in the

00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:18,289
spatial world particularly for Australia

00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:22,669
this actually kind of gets into the

00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:25,159
details of geospatial analysis is the

00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:28,220
tectonic plates always moving so much so

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:31,250
that we actually need to create a new

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,029
datum for Australia so before we were

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,219
using GN

00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:36,499
before tectonic plates have moved so

00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:39,019
much that Geoscience Australia which is

00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:41,479
the agency is responsible for a lot of

00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:45,559
like the USGS but for Australia they

00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:47,749
actually developing a new data GTA 2020

00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,070
so this will affect a lot of the data

00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:52,519
that's produced by government

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,649
departments but much like before just

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,419
read the metadata and their tools that

00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:59,479
will help automatically we project stuff

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:04,399
for you so just something to keep in

00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:06,409
mind in the next few years so just a

00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:09,019
folders kind of wrap up quickly with a

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:12,139
couple of the things I learned from over

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:14,059
the past couple years for me it's more

00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:16,159
of a personal statement like geospatial

00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:19,099
analysis is there like statistics it's

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,950
easy to do something that looks right

00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:24,830
but can be has some fundamental issues

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,830
at it and so just tread carefully if you

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,509
do start to do this kind of analysis the

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,219
official Doc's I think geo Jenko

00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:33,070
sponsored there has a lot of commercial

00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:35,239
interest in it I think a been bright

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,489
actively contribute to it and a few

00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,139
other commercial companies so the docs

00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,179
are actually pretty well maintained and

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:43,789
I use the docs quite a bit actually but

00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:46,879
drafting my slides so don't be afraid to

00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:49,070
use them when you are dealing with

00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:51,529
geospatial data II really careful of

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,499
coordinate systems of license of

00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:57,409
coverage so I did mention the PSMA

00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:59,059
they're great but they only are

00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:01,460
interested in Australia so if you are

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:03,349
the archetype will start up starting on

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,359
Austria and they want to go global you

00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:07,729
might need to think about who is

00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,649
providing your data and what coverage

00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:12,789
they might have because some might have

00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:12,789
better coverage than others

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,580
but above all check the metadata I come

00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:20,719
I shame to say that if she have made

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,940
mistakes where I haven't read the

00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:25,309
metadata and tried to do analysis I've

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,609
got what am I looking at and in the

00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:31,969
metadata it's a kind of steal stuff from

00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:34,159
the security people don't volume and

00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:36,499
crypto try to avoid if you can writing

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,440
your own libraries when you're doing

00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:40,820
geospatial analysis because talent

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,830
people are in there for you and they

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,850
will kind of help a lot with a lot of

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,250
analysis and a lot of the arm

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,420
assumptions that you may make so thank

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,770
you very much

00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,170
doing a few have time for questions

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,470
probably not the time for questions

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,600
hit me up on the slack channel I'll put

00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,800
my slides there but just trying to grab

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,160
me around the conference but thank you

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,160
