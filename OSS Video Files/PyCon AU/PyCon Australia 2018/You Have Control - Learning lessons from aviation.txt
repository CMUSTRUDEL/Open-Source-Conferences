Software (and Python) is growing to power ever more of the world, and it’s only getting more complex. How do we handle large distributed systems? Handle cascading failure? Prepare for emergencies and downtime? Aviation has been through it all, and we’ll look at how we can learn from them.

hello everybody first talk after the

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,420
break is going to be by Andrew Goodman

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,950
he's going to talk to us about all the

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,599
things we do wrong in our teen division

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,480
should but we should can look at

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,690
aviation and see how they solve all the

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:25,680
problems in the past give him a round of

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:28,320
applause Thank You raucous hello good

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,510
morning everyone so this talk is titled

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,369
you have control I'll get to what that

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,290
is later but it's about trying to learn

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,780
lessons from aviation so live it by

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,059
myself first I am Andrew Godwin if

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,360
you're unfamiliar with me I am a django

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,640
core developer most famous like infamous

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,100
for migrations and channels and things

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,379
of that nature my day job is at

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,379
Eventbrite and in my spare time one of

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,760
my many hobbies is being a private pilot

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,559
I've been a private pilot for about I'd

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
say five years now I learned I was

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,379
living in London before I moved to

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,789
California and when I moved to

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,680
California I was like oh well there's

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,049
even better weather here and much less

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,939
clouds and it's one-third the price that

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,400
helps things a lot before I continue

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,200
this talk has some difficult topics in

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,610
it so there's a Content warning it has a

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,830
very frank discussion or death and

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,540
accidents if this affects you this is

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,259
throughout the entire talk I'm afraid so

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,360
just be aware of that so let's start

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,460
with software software is very difficult

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,080
if you don't believe this then either

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,090
congratulations your genius or you

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,009
haven't been around long enough yet all

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,829
you think it was easy about ten years

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,049
ago but have my favorite thing is this

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,820
is not just true software my favorite

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,530
blog series in the world is an

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,729
unfortunately short one called things I

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,210
won't work with by Derek Lowe

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,399
Derek is a industrial chemist and he had

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,320
a wonderful series of talking about

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,110
various horrific chemical combinations

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,829
that he was continuum used people have

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,140
managed to make my favorite one is

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:57,869
titles sound won't save you this time

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,759
about a reader who asks well is there a

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,850
is there any substance in the world that

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,659
can make sand beyond fire and he says

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,880
well of course there is

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,800
and it goes on and like my favorite

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,269
thing is like you end up with a single

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
damn ethyl florene file which sounds

00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:17,470
very bad and then the the only correct

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,940
solution is to run away very fast one of

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,890
the fires in this article I believe

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,629
burned through three solid stories of

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,890
concrete into a basement and through the

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,360
catcher in the basement and kept going

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,040
for like you know a good few hundred

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,860
meters more it's not great so let's

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,660
think about what things we have perhaps

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,730
not particularly good and computing I

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,840
have a personal list of things I won't

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:44,010
work with it has things like Unicode

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,299
locales time time is terrible

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,390
calendaring no can't do calendaring

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,980
geography that's also terrible money

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,470
none of this stuff none of this stuff

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,940
please and the list goes on in short

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,629
it's all of everything in computing

00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,870
science and so we have a difficult field

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,310
and we realized this I think a lot of us

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,510
in this room have been through problems

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,959
that at least one of those things and

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,970
other things and sometimes we feel alone

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,560
sometimes we're like are we stuck in

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,450
this world we have these difficult

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,459
problems in our ivory towers but that's

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,019
not true Engineering is a general

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,200
discipline and there are many many other

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,669
forms of engineering and in particular

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,930
aviation and aeronautical engineering

00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,459
has been here before

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,400
a Boeing 7475 747 has 6 million

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,310
individual pieces now if you're

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,079
comparing none of my projects have this

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,400
many lines of code in it so I feel okay

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,889
about that this more impressive part is

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,440
that those planes have a zero point zero

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,200
zero zero zero zero six percent accident

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,620
rate they are incredibly reliable in

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,230
fact I I believe that I mean one

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,060
accident or two that contributes to that

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,620
particular number if you look at the

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,209
overall numbers airplanes are almost the

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,150
most safe thing in the world

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,519
trains are very slightly safer in terms

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,910
of a form of transport but they are on

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,319
the ground on Rails and sort of there's

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,330
no steering wheel or anything there's

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,110
the forwards and backwards lever

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,880
because cars are much worse and it says

00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,120
that walking is even more dangerous so

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,620
my advice is don't go outside if you're

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,750
going to the airport just go in some

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,550
sort of like train device so sorry

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,770
people in Melbourne about 1:00 but the

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,680
reality is when we look at this it turns

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,480
out that it's not just the machines it's

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,770
not just the engineering involved that

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,310
you might think about on technical level

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,710
it's also the people the causes of

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,750
accidents over three-quarters of

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,720
accidents in aviation are at least

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,700
partially caused by pilot error this is

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,650
often something people don't realize

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,030
people often think the mechanical

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,980
portion of this chart would be much much

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,780
bigger it turns out the mechanics are

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,270
very good at their jobs as all the

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,730
engineers and the problem the main

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,880
problem is you have these fallible human

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,830
beings flying giant metal boxes of air

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,810
and Happiness across the sky and

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,000
sometimes things that know perfectly

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,970
well but one of the interesting things

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,510
is even with this kind of accident rate

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,520
aviation is still incredibly safe

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,180
aviation and engineering in general has

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,550
taken those things and slowly over many

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,050
many decades knocked out every single

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,360
one of the risk factors to make it safer

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,340
and safer and safer so one of the things

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,930
I'm going to do here is go through six

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,640
of those main aviation principles that I

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,140
learned during my pilot training and

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,510
talking with other pilots other

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,400
engineers in aerospace mechanics

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,230
everyone in the field and how we can

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,280
start taking those and apply them to the

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:51,220
world software so first of all let's

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,780
talk about hard failure one of the key

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,660
things you learn when you start being a

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,190
pilot is if an instrument goes wrong say

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,560
your compass is wrong or your altimeter

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,130
stops reading correctly you don't just

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,860
ignore it

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,900
you put a piece of paper over it in an

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,450
electrical cockpit with screens rather

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,550
than analog instruments the computer

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,350
will remove the instrument from the

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,560
display and put a big red X in its place

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,500
there's a very strong hard failure in

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,660
that case this is because once something

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,940
has shown itself to be untrustworthy you

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,860
should not continue to trust it and this

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,660
is true of not just instruments but also

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,270
the autopilots engines even if

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,500
engine starts running really strangely

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,730
you know just turn it off but you try

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,340
and land and turn it off as soon as

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,010
possible air conditioning all this stuff

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,150
in airplanes is life critical and air

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,400
conditioning in the plane is the thing

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,440
that keeps you alive but of course this

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,450
only works with redundancy if an air

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,550
conditioning pack fails in a plane it it

00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,290
turns it off off but there's also two or

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,130
three to take its place

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,600
and of course you land immediately

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,570
because you've lost your redundancy

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,090
component and this often manifests and

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,340
software in interesting ways how many of

00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,990
you have at one point muttered phrases

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,850
like this like oh well we're just taking

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,430
all these errors that way the site won't

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,810
crash or well well what do for

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,540
validation they double just save the

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,360
invalidate we'll fix it later these are

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,850
fantastic ways to ensure you never fix

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,800
the thing in question I once got a great

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,380
data set on a project I worked on about

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,050
decade ago of football pitches in the

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,240
United Kingdom now geospatial data is a

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,430
wonderful thing especially when it

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,720
doesn't say what projection it's in I

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,750
eventually worked out it was the

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,860
wonderful osg b-36 projection so there's

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,320
no move if you know that in the room

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,380
congratulations but of course it wasn't

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,170
perfect there were errors one football

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,120
field was in Scandinavia definitely not

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,160
in the Younger Kingdom another one was

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,669
several hundred kilometers off the top

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,080
of the North Pole that was a fun one so

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,360
it's really important to not just have

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,370
good data but to make sure it's valid on

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,750
the way in something you'll see me say

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,780
at work a lot if you ever work with me

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,010
is like any code if you'll be like this

00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,660
error is not strong enough like raise a

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,430
traceback get it into a trace book

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,930
alerting system let somebody know it's

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,610
broken don't let it just don't let it

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,800
linger otherwise it'll be there for

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,090
years and years and years and this kind

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,060
of comes into the second principle which

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,040
I call good alerting in the cockpit you

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,730
only have a limited number of audio

00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,700
alarms and cockpits and Karthus unlevel

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,290
is - are very very selective about what

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,780
sets off an alarm there's only a few

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,480
different tones one tone means we're

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,950
gonna die a different tone means your

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,970
meal is ready and they are very

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,970
distinctly different tones

00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,700
but crucially they did some research and

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,380
once you get past four or five different

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,370
noises pilots couldn't distinguish them

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,279
they started forgetting what they meant

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,960
and so this has a thing what's called

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,510
alert fatigue it's not just a number of

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,510
tones and also if an alarm is constantly

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,460
going off your brain is very very good

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,839
at ignoring it your brain is developed

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,850
ability to ignore things that annoy you

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,040
on a constant basis this is very useful

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,930
things like pain but it also means that

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,880
if you get an email every day saying

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,830
this thing is broken your mind will just

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,290
slowly filter it out over time they'll

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,060
start forgetting about it so one of the

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,510
things you should do in this sense is

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,580
try and have very strict levels of

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,070
segregation those different tones I

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,190
often do things like critical normal and

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,250
background critical is this is really

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,720
bad it has to wake somebody up the

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,089
crucial part of that is it must be

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,100
actionable if you wake somebody up and

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,680
they can't do anything you've failed you

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,839
have to be able to do something if you

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,060
can't do anything it's not an alert it's

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,190
a bug in your application you shouldn't

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,510
like somebody up you should find whoever

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,779
designed that in and make them design it

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,339
out and it's weak normal stuff is a bit

00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,290
more relaxed like well is it it's an

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,959
error it's pretty bad but let's say

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,000
happens like you know 0.1% of people or

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,390
it's only two people in a certain area

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,589
or it's just Australians that's fine and

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,270
so that sort of thing you sort of you

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,490
blog you look in your air logs but you

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,839
fix over over a week or so it's not

00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,850
critically important but you should fix

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
it and then there's background stuff

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,560
things that are always breaking for

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,330
example like oh you know I work for

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,089
Eventbrite we're a large company we

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,800
process a lot of money a few

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,320
transactions fail every day because

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,540
that's just the nature of doing a lot of

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,700
commerce at that scale those for us are

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,360
metrics they're not errors we have an

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,040
expected level of failure of you know on

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,050
a global scale how many transactions

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,370
won't work properly that's not a thing

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,620
we get error emails about is that then

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,330
we have as metrics if you've been

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,350
ignoring air for a week just turn off

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,779
his error report you won't miss it

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,260
you're ignoring it and everybody else

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,250
will go to the you probably thank you

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,370
this thing comes into finding your

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,339
limits one of the important things that

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,519
I learnt going into aviation

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:50,149
was that we don't say if things will

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,579
fail we say when they will fail

00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:56,220
everything fails the keys are no when it

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:59,189
fails often you see this phrased as

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,129
what's good MTTF mean time to failure or

00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:04,860
MTBF mean time between failures but in

00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,930
general what it means is you do a lot of

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,120
analysis and research you take the thing

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,149
you're testing and you break it again

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,129
and again and again one of my favorite

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,800
pictures is this picture this is from

00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:19,220
the Boeing factory in Seattle this I

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,990
believe is a 737 or thereabouts

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,779
the wings you will notice are not of a

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,120
good angle this is what's called the

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,999
bring break test Boeing deliberately

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,889
take planes that are pretty much fully

00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,689
built on an airframe level and will just

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:35,180
pull the wings up until they snap and

00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:37,740
they'll do it again and again and again

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,209
they're not just you know trying to

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,189
break planes for the hell of it they're

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,889
trying to work out what angle those

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:45,540
wings get to before they fail the design

00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,040
envelope for the plane is about 20

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,749
degrees of angle before they break

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,839
that's what the worst storm in history

00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:54,540
will flex a plane's wings to these wings

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
break at 55 degrees that means you know

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,920
you have a incredible margin of error

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,629
between your design envelope and what

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,209
you need to get to and this is true of

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:06,329
software too you don't have to be able

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,649
to perfectly scale to huge amounts of

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:10,139
traffic from day one if you're a small

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,410
start-up you do not need to handle you

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,939
know 10,000 requests per second but what

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,399
it is important is to know where your

00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:18,600
limit is if you know that your chemist

00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,149
Roger can handle let's say a hundred

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,550
requests a second when you get to 50 you

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,589
go art well we've only got half of our

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,120
buffer left now is there time to start

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,499
the big product to improve our scaling

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,339
don't wait to you get to the actual

00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:34,679
breakage point risk is very good when

00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,079
you're informed knowing when things

00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,540
break let's you take that risk in a very

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,860
informal manner and understand how far

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,629
along that path you are to things

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,399
breaking when you're doing big

00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,990
engineering projects and as you get

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,449
bigger into a bigger company things just

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:51,629
take longer having that planning and

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:53,790
that ability to look ahead in time and

00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,579
know when things gonna stop working lets

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,630
you really understand how to plan things

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,000
had to prioritize things

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,880
and part of this too is not just

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,449
planning around failure but building for

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,740
failure it's not just good enough to you

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,589
know say that oh yeah it's all gonna

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,279
break and at some point things will just

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:16,079
go wrong we don't take pilots and train

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,089
them for oh well we're trading you for

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,790
great flying we're training you to fly

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,529
in perfectly clear skies and no wind

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,550
that's it training down thank you here

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:27,630
you go

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,399
in an aircraft design no single thing in

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,509
the aircraft can take it down as I

00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,949
mentioned before it's full of

00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:36,899
redundancies and this is because chaos

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,509
is just part of the world right things

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,490
manually break things break before that

00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,920
mean time to failure they may be some

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,589
sort of weird thing you didn't plan for

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,370
something and specification everything

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:52,980
like that and one of those things you

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,589
want is this for our code as well you

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,959
don't want a site that where if any one

00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,370
thing breaks the whole thing dies

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,620
because as your site grows and scale

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,319
you're adding more and more and more

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,449
single points of failure and inevitably

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:09,089
if your site relies on every single

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,220
server being up and you now have 100,000

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,560
servers like one's gonna break at least

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,089
every day like machines are fallible and

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,819
actually get more of them you will see

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,230
those things become more real how do you

00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:21,389
tackle this though well you tackle it

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,240
the same way that we tackle it in other

00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:26,399
engineering disciplines you actually

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,709
fail things to see what happens one of

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,110
the fun things to do if you have we know

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,399
at least a few servers just kill the

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,339
application randomly on a server each

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,230
day Netflix is chaos monkey is most

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:39,360
famous for doing this but it's a very

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,970
good practice to do often it's referred

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,009
to isn't like crash-proof software and

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,519
it's not just servers or applications

00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,470
dying one of my most favorite really

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,500
nasty things the detect is network

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,810
failures and not I proper full failure

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,399
no no no no when it goes like oh it's

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,139
five seconds latency it's still there

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,970
all your monitoring says all the

00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,069
connections still up but everything's

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,899
really really slow and a lot of

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,000
applications don't understand that

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,189
middle point between things are good and

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,870
things are entirely broken and will just

00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,610
struggle long and spin up and use and

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,700
more and more resolve

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,410
really Janne themself in in the process

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,720
another thing here too is unreliable

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,540
connections now again Australia's you're

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,250
all familiar with this the rest of the

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,140
world can't talk to you very easily but

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,899
also in you know a lot of people these

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,300
days use 3G or for mobile phones for

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,950
their connection to the Internet the

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,110
number of times I've had an app on my

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,240
mobile phone that doesn't work in

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,140
situations where you get signal it goes

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,910
away for two minutes

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,410
you get signal again it goes away this

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,560
is the London London Underground by the

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,740
way just is astonishing

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,000
people just don't think about this and

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,610
as I said before like the majority of

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
pilot training is handling emergencies

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,250
of my training around three quarters was

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,709
my structure just randomly turning the

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,970
engine to idle or saying oh you've lost

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,890
your compass and covering up with his

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,410
hand or various other really nasty

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,329
things like that because we're not there

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,990
to practice flying like flying is very

00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,660
easy

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,089
my very first flying lesson i sat in the

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,279
airplane the instructor went ok you can

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:15,110
take off I was like what it's like oh

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,670
yeah just just pull out the throttle and

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,060
pull back on the stick it will just take

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,529
off by itself that bit is very easy the

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,350
thing they train you for is when you

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,269
take off and then the engine fails or

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,820
when you take off and go to the cruise

00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,760
and then the engine fails or if there's

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:35,089
a fire and one of the main ways we do

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,410
this is checklists this is a excerpt

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,470
from my very first checklist from the

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,360
plane I learnt in a Cessna 152 this is

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,250
one of three pages of emergency handling

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,380
it's very easy to find it's all this

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,640
lovely big red striped board on it so

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,829
you can find it in a little booklet

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,680
easily and every single situation you

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:55,970
might have engine fire is right there it

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,980
has a simple checklist because it turns

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,380
out when you're under pressure and when

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,690
things are going wrong the human brain

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,490
is terrible at remembering precise

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,679
instructions but it's very very good

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,150
reading off a competing convenient piece

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,130
of cardboard and doing them in order and

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,990
so you know in the case of engine fire

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,459
you close the throttle you pull out the

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,069
mixture you turn all the fuel ignition

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,520
off and then you do a forced landing and

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,660
it says do not turn to restart because

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,370
if it's been on fire before it's

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,140
probably be on fire again if you start

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,100
out

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,179
and chat with something good in aviation

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,280
they are good in other industries too

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,100
one of the most interesting developments

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,440
is in medicine where checklists have

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,570
improved success rates for operations by

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,620
a substantial amount and it's also true

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,850
for software if you have software it's

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,320
going to fail at some point if you're

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,809
doing software as a service or houses

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,870
software at least and that means you

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:52,120
should be ready for it to fail and being

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,530
ready doesn't mean like making sure

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,340
you've got some beer in the fridge or

00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,410
something like that no it means

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,679
practicing it you want to practice

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,150
failure and go ok wait this week we're

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,470
gonna try turning off the main database

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,270
for 10 seconds see what happens on

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,470
obviously on a separate staging

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,020
environment not in the production one

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,669
please but the point is your operations

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,520
team your SRE team or whoever's doing

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:15,100
this should be ready to do these things

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,299
when the inevitable happens the reaction

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,500
shouldn't be oh no

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,210
three actually I'll write me do this one

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,250
last week all right it should be this

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,470
practice approach this easy way of

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,510
getting towards that stuff that's one of

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,500
the ways you start solving the greater

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,000
complexity problem with people but as I

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,309
said the problem is not just technical

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,470
these four previous points have been

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,919
about mechanical technical problems in

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,130
particular but human error is a big

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,360
proportion of aviation problems and I

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,120
would argue a big proportion of

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,610
engineering problems as well one of the

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,200
most important things especially in

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,240
large-scale engineering is good

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,490
communication the title of this talk

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,860
comes from when you hand over control of

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,780
an aircraft when you give somebody

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,610
control of the plane you tell them you

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,020
have control they then tell you back I

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,360
have control and you confirm with them

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,890
you have control it's called positive

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,620
transfer of control this is a very

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,000
important concept because this comes

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,850
from a lesson where this didn't happen

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,929
in the plane crashed because both pilots

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,809
thought the other one was flying the

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:19,030
plane and you can imagine what happened

00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,480
this is not obviously quite as fatal in

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,160
software

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,780
but as you work on bigger and bigger

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,470
projects as I've had the pleasure to do

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,169
throughout my career

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,870
you'll get teams doing different parts

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,309
of stuff and more and more of them and

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,080
as you get more and more different teams

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:34,660
you'll find yourself talking to more

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,370
people and that nice bubble of all I

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,760
know what everything's doing I know

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,210
however

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,120
happens doesn't exist anymore in fact as

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,500
you grow communication becomes

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,630
exponentially harder if you've got a

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,220
small team you can happily sit in you

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,420
know the room and over tea and just

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,190
discuss what's happening between the two

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,770
different parts of your application but

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,590
as you get bigger and bigger the number

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,720
of people you have to talk to literally

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,160
exponentially increases in an

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,640
organization the site the one I work in

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,220
now we have over 300 engineers I cannot

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,530
talk to all of them even once a month we

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,680
have to work on good communication and

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,690
that's not just having things like being

00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,030
able to talk to each other properly and

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:20,080
training but also understanding that you

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,520
need to not know everything you have to

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,350
have people delegated to go and do

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,870
communication there's a reason we have

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,210
good managers who go and handle that

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,490
part for you and also write everything

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,250
down I work with a team who works across

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,900
nine different time zones in two

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,870
different primary languages Spanish and

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,880
English things written down Masey

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,140
reduced the number of meetings

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,270
especially when meetings between Madrid

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,370
and San Francisco are at bad times of

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,950
both parties I do not get up 8:00 in the

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:51,400
morning I'm sorry I do once but you know

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,720
that's me and then finally it's very

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,000
important to have a clear chain of

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,390
command one of the things you often find

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,830
as you grow as a company is the previous

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,380
sort of oh well we're just gonna make

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,220
decisions as we go and we're gonna find

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,780
the right person for the job

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,480
stops working you have to start having

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,500
that clear idea of who makes decisions

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,700
and it's not just making decisions it's

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,730
making decisions when they're difficult

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,460
a lot of the time there's never a

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,530
correct answer it's a skill I've learned

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,390
over many years to be able to go

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,240
actually neither of these is the right

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,460
choice but we have to pick one and be

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,540
willing to defend that one at least to a

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,390
point as you go out and having

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,340
consistency is more important and this

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,820
comes the final point which is blame

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:37,330
culture there is a big problem in

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,010
aviation in the 70s and 80s there's a

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,810
reason I know all these stats I show you

00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,520
the graphs these graphs are sourced you

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,760
can see the citations in the earliest

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,710
lines every single incident of an

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,240
aircraft is reported investigated by the

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,070
National Board of the country usually

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,410
that the

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,690
crashed in all the aircraft is from and

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,460
one of the key things we realized

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,160
starting in World War two and continuing

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,130
was that let's never a single cause of a

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,400
problem problems always come from two or

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:08,070
three sources you never expected and

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,440
often one of those is human error but

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,660
it's not the humans fault you shouldn't

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,210
blame them because you can do things to

00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,950
mitigate them if you ever see a problem

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,530
you should make it very very hard to do

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,380
again if an intern drops a production

00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,030
database it's not just their fault you

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,800
shouldn't blame them why could they do

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,210
that in the first place why did you have

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,130
anybody with the access to drop the

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,140
production database like even the main

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:33,450
administrator should have to go through

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,250
like a sort of wargames turn your key

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,760
second secondary kind of thing to get

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,770
out to do and one of my most favorite

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,970
examples of this and having been to

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:47,070
Hawaii recently is last year when

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,500
residents of Hawaii got this wonderful

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,270
message on their phones telling them

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,220
there was a inbound ballistic missile

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,510
threat now this as you can imagine is

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,940
very sobering and wakes you up very

00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:02,910
quickly and the person who did this was

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,070
fired and let go I think we reassigned

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,900
which is because like this person is

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,940
never gonna make that mistake again

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,190
this is the most expensive lesser than

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,990
that person's ever going to have and of

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,090
course you won't blame them when I show

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,550
you the interface that were using now

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:22,230
you'll notice here there's a lot of

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:25,350
links this link is different to this

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,900
link the top one is the real one the

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,310
bottom one is the drill one the person

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,980
in question just clicked the wrong link

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:34,440
they are the same size they are on the

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,540
same part of a page for some reason the

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,930
really bad one is closer to the top

00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,690
which is bad UX design this is a case of

00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:45,030
it's very very simple to stop this same

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,010
thing happening again but how do you

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,390
encourage this how do you get to a place

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,550
of no blame culture of improving

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,230
yourself rather than pushing blame onto

00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,750
others well it's important to collect

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,310
reporting if things like this happen you

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,930
should have an open environment like

00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,700
people can come to you and say yes I

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,920
screwed up I'm sorry

00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,210
here's what I did here's how I did it

00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,760
how can we stop this happening again

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,370
sit down have a post-mortem go through

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,890
those steps and try and understand what

00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,140
happened and use that person's expertise

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,940
and their experience to fix things do

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,980
not blame them it's never just their

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,340
faults there are some people who are

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,350
just you know malicious actors they're a

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,520
different scenario but in general the

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,010
people you work with the people you

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,799
volunteer with whoever pretty much have

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,770
the best intentions in mind it's up to

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,480
you to work with everybody to improve

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,370
that experience for everyone and so that

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,690
next time it's not you who make the same

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:42,059
mistake now of course you know these

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,000
five facets these six facets are just a

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,880
small part of as a larger way we do

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,090
design in aviation and aerospace in

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,340
general but there is one thing we say a

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,700
lot of these rules and regulations that

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,640
apply to aircraft everything like that

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,260
all those rules are written in blood

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,990
every time there's a rule or a

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,000
regulation it's nearly always from a

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:09,000
previous crash somebody had at least

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,990
been injured if not died to bring you

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,730
that particular piece of regulation and

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,909
you might think that software is not

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,590
there yet

00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:22,409
well unfortunately we're very closer

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,770
than I would like I'll go through a few

00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:28,200
examples of where software has had this

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:30,419
particular effect I'm sure many of you

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,760
familiar with Mallory Hamilton she was

00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:35,730
the lead on the Apollo programs software

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,140
division this stack of papers here is in

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,770
fact the source code for the Apollo

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,950
lunar module Nora Hamilton and her team

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,850
invented basically real-time computer

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,490
computing and watchdog recovery the

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,649
Apollo 11 lunar lander overload itself

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,460
on descent the number of interrupts from

00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:57,510
the downward-facing radar altimeter

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,730
overloaded the computer and made it

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,309
unusable if it wasn't for the code that

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,140
she and her team had written which made

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,669
the computer watchdog itself reboot back

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,799
into a basic recovery mode and continue

00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:08,700
basic flight functions the astronauts

00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,880
would have died in crashing to the

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,159
surface this is a case of very very good

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,920
software because she knew all the hell

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,710
she was doing that's not the case

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,830
the Patriot missile the Patriot missile

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,740
is infamous because it used

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:29,790
floating-point numbers always good start

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,740
and it had a bug where I had been turned

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,600
on for a certain amount of time the

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,730
floating-point inaccuracies built up and

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,970
built up and built up to a point when

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,370
when it been on for too long it just got

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,470
the position of the thing that meant hit

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,910
wrong so the Patriot reference is a

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,010
missile intercept system it's a defense

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:50,330
system it's meant to shoot down incoming

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:54,150
artillery to protect a base area usually

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,860
and in this case they left it on too

00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,160
long the floating-point area built up

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,280
and it missed the missile and it killed

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,140
28 people as a result

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,600
tharok is perhaps even more infamous

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,770
and if you're not heard of ther ACK

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,360
congratulations you it's very so being

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:14,400
read this was someone's amazing idea to

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,310
have a fully software controlled x-ray

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,700
machine as a programmer that sounds

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,900
terrifying the exposure and aperture of

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,310
the machine would controlled purely by

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:28,110
software and there was a bug where in a

00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,790
certain situation the aperture would

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,100
stay open and give the person underneath

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,540
a lethal dose of x-rays it killed at

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,790
least three people it severely injured

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,430
at least three more and the irony is it

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,710
had a hardware interlock but in all

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,900
their testing it was very basic testing

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,670
not testing the destruction the software

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,690
but fine so they removed the harbor

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,490
interlock in the final product for

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,350
cost-saving measures and that's the

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,640
reason that the soft because like the

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,380
hard rinse locked was what was saving

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,430
things and tests they removed it it'll

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:58,650
win up and of course much more recently

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,800
we have example of you brought on this

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,870
vehicle that saw bird s trian analyzed

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,840
them and wrote them off as not a threat

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,820
and crash right into them we have a lot

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,680
of stuff in software that is getting

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,380
increasingly involved with human lives

00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,330
I would hope most of your software isn't

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,690
or if it is that you are doing it

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,300
correctly

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,920
I am always reassure that most of stuff

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,590
I write is not in a live critical path

00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,080
but as we grow it's not just things that

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,400
seem obvious like driving or machinery

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,960
it's all the things like social

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,060
interactions like you know we've seen

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,980
the rise of extremism things we do as

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,660
software engineers

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,220
rhythms that we show the videos will

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,650
show people on YouTube or have an effect

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,120
on people and so as we go into the

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,309
future of software as we progress

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,100
families making big impact in people's

00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,809
lives let's maybe try and learn some of

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,470
those lessons from aviation and take

00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:47,780
them forward

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:58,220
and maybe build some of our own thank

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:58,910
you very much thank you Andrew thank you

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,460
very much

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:04,820
token of appreciation from PyCon thank

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,010
you next on stage here is Curtis Maloney

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,919
with who gives us a short introduction

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:12,200
into place and logging after a ten

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,180
minutes break for room fingers another

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,859
round of applause for under thank you
