Coding is a creative process. But we don’t really learn about creativity, usually it's all exception handling and Big O complexity. This talk is about introspection and calm coding in the face of long stack traces. Also, I'll be doing a live watercolour painting at the same time.

hi everyone we'll get started we have

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,300
grace Nolan here is going to be speaking

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,429
about reflections on the creative

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,769
process illustrated with watercolor

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,310
painting can we have a round of applause

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,710
please

00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,710
[Applause]

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,430
all right you can all hear me fine thank

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,730
you for coming and to the somewhat

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,170
experimental talk and let me introduce

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,390
myself so this is me in the mornings

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,300
when I've woken up and just scrolled

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,890
through Twitter to see the drummer of

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,110
the day I do security at Google I've

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,700
done some talks on like lock-picking so

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,270
some people might recognize me from that

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,670
I am also a purple con organizer and

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,039
this is a conference coming up in

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,750
Wellington in November and it's about

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,079
security and it's for developers and

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,830
defenders all right so why am I doing

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:10,950
this talk do you recognize this

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:17,280
president over us so let's paint some

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:19,409
goddamn happy little trees so let's just

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,430
switch to camera yeah all right let me

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:27,600
know if you can't see this very well so

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,960
first what I'm doing is I am ripping the

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,090
paper

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,979
with water and I think it's really

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,340
important to like you know make a plan

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,780
before you start working and this is

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,659
kind of you know the same as when you're

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:44,189
doing programming you think ahead maybe

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,380
write some pseudocode and have like an

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,579
idea of what it is that you're wanting

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,460
to do so the style that I'm doing is

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:58,020
cold like wit on wit and so it makes it

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:03,479
like very kind of like bloom hisk which

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,990
you'll see in a moment so I'm not going

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,539
to tell you what I'm painting you can

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:15,450
figure it out when you

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:17,459
soon see the end all right the thing

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,769
that happens with watercolor is that you

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,030
don't really know exactly how its kind

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:26,459
of going to turn out water has like this

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,480
really weird way of behaving where it

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:36,390
doesn't always like do what you think

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,670
it's going to do so I'm just gonna put

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:44,430
some purple purple is a pretty good

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,720
color it's one of my favorites so yeah

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,310
please doesn't be with me can you see

00:02:45,720 --> 00:03:01,769
all right yeah it's a little bit shiny

00:02:47,310 --> 00:03:05,700
yeah not doing not too bad so thank you

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,950
for your patience and watching so these

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,290
colors as I put them down in kind of

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:14,280
these widths pledges I'm gonna like

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,680
slowly blend together in a way that I

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,590
can't predict they're just gonna do what

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,930
they want to do and that's okay it was

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:27,060
like go along with it and that's like

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:29,099
pot of pot of the magic you know all

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,250
right so maybe we'll just leave that for

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,250
now

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,890
I think you know this when I've been

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,460
painting I kind of think about like how

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:13,130
it reminds me of programming at times

00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,510
like there's different kinds of papers

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:23,300
so this one has is very textured which

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:26,990
means that the paint absorbs much better

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,880
than like a flat surface where when it's

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,730
a flat surface the painter the paint

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,280
just kind of sits on top and like kind

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,990
of blends like very differently I think

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,890
this is kind of like you know being

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:47,660
familiar with your hardware and knowing

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:51,740
like you know what what you can expect

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:56,170
when you try different things all right

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:59,660
I think I'm just gonna like leave that

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:11,570
for the time being so I can just do its

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:14,210
thing a little bit of this all right so

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,140
this is just going to like hang out the

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,850
paint will change as a dress we're just

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,410
gonna hope for the best that it's gonna

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:28,970
turn out okay so at this point I kind of

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:31,100
get a little bit stressed which kind of

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,050
like I don't know if you can tell maybe

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,669
it's hard when I'm presenting so you

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,360
might expect like some amount of stress

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:40,040
anyway but as it kind of gets near the

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,230
end I'm kind of like oh I want to add

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,300
things here or should I be adding stuff

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,860
to these other places this is going to

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,680
turn out how I think it's going to turn

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,080
out and I really feel like I have no

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,760
idea what I'm doing and like you know

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,440
the paint behaves in a way that's like

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,110
different sometimes to what I might

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,570
expect it to similar to like you know

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,700
that air is that I get sometimes when I

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,020
coding and I do not understand what's

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,570
going on and sometimes this kind of this

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,650
compounds to the point where I start

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,840
thinking like can I even do

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,270
the aughts at all and same with

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:22,410
computers like can I even curd like why

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,820
why am I doing this if it's so hot which

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,419
kind of brings me to the point of this

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,850
talk when I was doing painting as a

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,990
hobby I noticed how I was feeling and

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:37,740
how you know I would start out with this

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,350
blank page and I'd be like all right I'm

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,620
gonna create something I'm you know I

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,490
have little anticipation I have a belief

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,510
around like you know I can do this for

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,949
the most part there's a little bit of

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,990
doubt but like you know it's a clean

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,729
slate so it's okay and then I start

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,210
adding things I start I write out some

00:06:53,729 --> 00:07:00,300
pseudocode I start sketching out some

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,120
you know functions and then maybe it's

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,260
not quite shaping up how I might - how I

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,789
might expect it at first and that that's

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,470
sort of like stressed me out a little

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,860
and then I started getting errors

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,020
starting to try and test it and I

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,720
noticed like the curves of like these

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,539
emotions that I had where the same is

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,310
when I was painting but when I was

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,990
coding it was much more severe because

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,169
it's like for my career right so my

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,169
whole career hinges on my ability to

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:33,150
like write this functionality and at

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,960
least that's you know that's how it

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,669
feels so why do I do these stressful

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,930
things of like coding so stressful to me

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:45,169
why do I do it

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:47,940
why am I in this why am I in this career

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,030
and to do that I'm gonna give you some

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,710
context sir

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,229
fortunately I'm not gonna start out from

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,160
when I was born I'm just gonna talk

00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:02,190
about from when I was looking at doing

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,440
design because I really liked the idea

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,660
of having these cool funky interactive

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,639
art projects that could teach people

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:13,349
meaning and could you know convey an

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,599
idea of something that we should be

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:20,849
caring about as a society and I was like

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,320
den that sounds so awesome and I started

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,039
doing design and I did a coding paper

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,059
and I found it really really hard

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,800
and I was and I realized that if I were

00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:31,719
to continue during design and then

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,419
whenever I wanted to do one of these

00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:38,199
like interactive art projects I probably

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,459
get avoidant I think that I would not

00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:42,760
want to do it because it'd be hard and

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:44,440
painful and I realized that I wasn't

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,720
really gonna be able to achieve the

00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,760
things that I wanted to if I didn't

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,440
spend more time doing what I found

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,380
difficult so it was no longer a

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,170
limitation of my creativity so I got

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,569
indecisive and in that time I went to

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,060
this conference called cubic on which is

00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:03,339
a hacker con in New Zealand and that

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,649
really inspired me to like want to learn

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,360
more about the technical aspects of

00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,579
computers and like really understand

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,490
what's going on and so I changed him to

00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:16,600
computer science knowing that it was

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:19,120
going to be really hard I you know I had

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,579
some experience coding at this point I

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,069
knew that it was going to be quite

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:26,019
miserable and sure enough it was I used

00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:28,300
to be at the point where I'd like cry

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,699
every time I I was like I'm working on

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,630
coding projects and it was kind of

00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:36,519
shitty so but I managed you know

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,500
obviously I've made it here right sir I

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,480
managed to like work through these

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,579
feelings I don't constantly cry at work

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,620
which is great so I wanted to go through

00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:54,010
an example of how I kind of got through

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,860
these feelings were like managing like

00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,579
self-regulating my feelings like woah

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:03,730
doing this work and so the example I'm

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:10,120
going to use is at when I was working on

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:12,430
a Jenga API and for some reason I wasn't

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,470
getting the data back that I wanted to I

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,389
was just running I wasn't getting

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,339
anything back and what like I wasn't

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,589
able to like really test it that well or

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,839
like I had no idea what was going on

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,329
and I knew that I should ask for help

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,980
but like I was starting to get really

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,720
stressed and I felt like you know maybe

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,850
I could just spend like 20 more minutes

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,339
working on this and see if I can get any

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,700
further and in that time I would start

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,220
kind of spiraling out and being like

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,170
can I even do this career if I'm stuck

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,940
on writing this goddamn API for this app

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,280
maybe maybe there's no point to this and

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,220
if I can't do this career then what else

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,050
am I gonna do I really like computers

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,860
they are like the thing that I want to

00:10:52,050 --> 00:11:01,410
do sir it created a lot of owner

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,660
feelings so thanks to your webcomic name

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,760
don't come for their wonderful owner

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,970
comics definitely recommend having a

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,300
look so what do I do with these owner

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,640
feelings do I keep working do I keep

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:20,280
trying to like hit my head against this

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,290
brick wall or do I give up do i stuff do

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,550
I like take a break or go home and like

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,650
try again tomorrow

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,900
I like run away from my problems and how

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,010
far can I went away from them for I'd

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,210
really like to run away from my problems

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:37,530
I love to do that so really I'm not in a

00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:39,330
good space to make decisions so the

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,780
important thing to do first is to

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:46,800
de-escalate and to so for me one of the

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:51,360
things that I might do is I will grab a

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,040
glass of water and I will sip that glass

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,840
of water for like 20 minutes and all I

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,940
will do is try and think about that

00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,310
glass of water I'll look at how the

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,210
light moves through the glass and like

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:07,740
how cool the water feels when I drink it

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:10,800
and really kind of like even like you

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,960
can smell the water it's very fresh and

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,540
like just kind of pull all of my senses

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:20,090
to that until I'm not distressed anymore

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,580
so that's a really important first step

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:27,270
next thing is to accept the situation so

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,460
you know I am currently working on this

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,440
like API I haven't asked for help and

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,980
it's been four days already of me like

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,360
feeling terrible and this really reminds

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,420
me of doing watercolor painting where

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,750
you just have to let the water do its

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,360
thing

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,130
you can't fight against it the more that

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,880
you fight against it the worse that's

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,280
going to get so really it's just it's

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,350
really important to accept where things

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,750
and to move from that place so you kind

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,940
of get to a decision

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,700
crossroads after this so this is when I

00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,020
revisit those feelings of like do I give

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,560
up go home or do I keep going and and

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:09,720
there's a couple of ways to try and help

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,110
make this somewhat ambiguous situation

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,940
into one that's a little bit clearer and

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,000
so one of the ways that I do this is I

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,430
look at what these two different things

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,730
feel like what does it feel like when

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,210
I'm in the give up zone what does it

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,850
feel like when I think about keeping on

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,350
going like where where what what are

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,580
those different states feel like to me

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,520
and it was a way of giving going into

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,570
maybe like a better example of what this

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,480
feels like I'm going to show you a

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,740
couple of drawings one that I did when I

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,220
was feeling really awful in high school

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:54,090
there's much kind of illustrates what my

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,070
mood is somewhat like at those times and

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,340
then on the other side I have this

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,580
painting which is I did this project

00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,100
called the hundred days project which we

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,650
do a creative thing every day for a

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,080
hundred days and this is day 100 this is

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,420
me on the last day of having made it

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,150
through and doing a watercolor painting

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,440
every day so I really wanted to capture

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:22,820
like that kind of free feeling and I

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,300
think these two really like the perfect

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:29,520
examples right the next thing I can do

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,339
now that I have this kind of data about

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,730
myself as I can look at my values you

00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,040
know what's more in line with my values

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,540
is that like self care is really

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,490
important you know sir

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,180
like sometimes giving up and taking a

00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:47,970
break is important that's like more of a

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,589
short-term thing though perhaps like

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,870
I'll probably still have that problem

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,450
the next day that I go into work it's

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,450
not going to have magically disappeared

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:59,460
so I think about what I'm trying to do

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,040
and at that time I was wanting to

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,160
upskill like I wasn't sure if being a

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,490
developer is what I

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:10,449
I wanted to do I wasn't quite sure on

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,449
the exact part of you know computer

00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,790
science I guess and I'd already given up

00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,800
on doing interactive app projects

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,670
because I realize how awful it is to

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,579
code anything that's like horrific

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:26,620
relating so I decided that actually I

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,269
really definitely did not want to do

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,230
that stuff so I had already ruled it out

00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:33,819
thank goodness and I realized yeah I

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,040
wanted to upskill I wanted to like get

00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:38,370
better I wanted to prove to myself that

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,050
I can work through these things

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,149
so by using these measures you know I

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,569
can decide that actually it's better for

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:50,290
me to keep going with this problem to

00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:52,389
get help to find out what information

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,639
I'm missing because pretty much in every

00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,629
case the reason why I get stressed is

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,970
because I don't have all the information

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:00,279
I don't know how the system is working

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,399
at that time I haven't looked at the

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,790
right logs I haven't like put in print

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,680
statements or whatever it is so I

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,050
realize like I can actually just do some

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,250
information gathering and work through

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,800
this problem and I'll feel much better

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,250
it's in line with my values I can be

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,589
like the the lady that I painted for day

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,759
100 and everything is like much better

00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,319
the next thing to do is to commit to

00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,139
that decision so even when I'm facing

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,680
doubt again by revisiting their problem

00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:36,370
it's really important for me to stick

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,339
with that to know that I've already

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,610
weighed up you know what I wanted to do

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,170
I looked at the options and there's no

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,089
reason for me to go back to there you

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,809
know time life is short you're just got

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,329
to keep going

00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:54,130
so once I've made a decision it's really

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:56,980
good to commit to it so now we're just

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,600
gonna go back to the painting so if you

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:06,339
see it's kind of changed a bit it's not

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:07,929
so shiny anymore it has dried so next

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,319
I'm going to make up this dot color I

00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:12,669
have like a little bit on my palate and

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,579
and what our color painting you don't

00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,579
really find black what you find is

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,459
you blend colors together this color it

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:32,090
was too much of that one oh well let me

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:33,890
just start again yeah sometimes so it

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,640
turns out like in real life you don't

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,440
you very rarely see pure black most of

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,059
time you're seeing like shadows which is

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,350
like I don't even think that you can

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,429
really see what I'm doing I can like

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:55,460
seems a bit risky doesn't it holding

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:59,570
this like over my painting but yeah no I

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,610
think I'm sure it's gonna be fine trust

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,450
me I've done this so many times before

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,880
where the paint has leaked through so he

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:13,130
actually looks like this orange orangey

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:16,610
terracotta red color with like this kind

00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:20,120
of blur and somehow adding those things

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:22,490
makes black and I was really been

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,409
boozled by this when I like first came

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,429
across it it's like surely this is not

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:33,740
real like how is it that that's how you

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:36,470
make make black but turns out you can

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,960
just blend like any colors that are like

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,880
opposite to each other and then you'll

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
get some kind of black so you could

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,419
blaine like purple and yellow and you'll

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,899
get this kind of very warm kind of brown

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:55,490
like shadowy color and this this is kind

00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:57,890
of really blew my mind when when i was

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,260
kind of starting out so when i was

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,919
starting out i just bought like a black

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,370
color like a fool and thought this is

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:12,799
surely how I'm going to do this but it's

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:14,779
not the way I decide found when I first

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,470
started painting watercolors which was

00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:20,870
like in high school I got like a sit I

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,399
really just wanted to create things like

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,659
I just wanted to create what I wanted to

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:28,100
create and I wanted to do really cool

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:30,080
like fantasy paintings and they always

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,610
kind of turned out like not what I

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,010
them to be and then I lift the hubby for

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:40,250
a while like I kind of stopped stop

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:43,460
doing it and eventually I figured out

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,669
that like if I actually feel her what

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:50,929
the artists are saying then it goes a

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:53,269
lot better for me like I again learned

00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:57,549
the techniques that the wise people

00:19:53,269 --> 00:20:01,250
before me have you know spent time

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:04,720
centuries like figuring out and those

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,880
work a whole lot better funnily enough

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,039
so then I kind of moved into a state

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,889
where I actually just recreated images

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:19,700
that other people have done and I found

00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:24,320
that this was like a much better way of

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:29,600
going about it I found that my skills

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,080
were improving a lot faster and I'm

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,690
starting to get to the point where I can

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,250
create things that like from the top of

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,929
my head which is pretty awesome like I

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,240
just didn't really think after I kind of

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:48,320
given up on that I dare I thought like

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,769
well looks like looks like I just can't

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:58,190
you know create original original

00:20:51,769 --> 00:21:02,809
designs but yeah it turns out that you

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:06,740
know listening to your elders can be

00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:08,929
pretty good I think maybe this is the

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,279
equivalent of reading the words on the

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,940
blog posts not just looking at the

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,940
coding chunks

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,650
all right so I think this looks like a

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:29,380
painting now does this look like a

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:32,710
picture yeah closer hi son I feel so

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:36,400
good when I like get to they get to the

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,690
end like the finish like this is this is

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,560
the best part and it also happens when

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:43,420
I'm coding as well like he'll be you

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,800
know working on something and Alvey I've

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,660
spent all that time being stressed and

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,030
then suddenly it's all fitting together

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,060
and it looks like a whole piece and I'm

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:56,350
like I can't believe that I'm that I've

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,580
got this fire and and I want to keep

00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,050
going because at that point it feels

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,130
really good I want to keep adding the

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,990
paint and I want to keep happening

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,210
features because I feel good about this

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:08,440
project now but really the important

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:11,230
thing is to stop one of the worst things

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,890
that you can do with a water color

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:17,340
painting is over paint what a color it

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,140
gets its vibrancy from the white paper

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,850
underneath so the more layers that you

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,230
put on top of it the murkier that it

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:28,180
gets and you can really I've certainly

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,530
destroyed some paintings in my time

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:37,690
because of this as well as made coding

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,830
projects like unmanageable and put it

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,610
tried to put in all these features that

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:45,550
were terrible and then I hated the

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,120
project again so I got a stuff stuck

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:51,910
when it's good next thing is is to allow

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,970
appreciation time so feel like hells

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,280
yeah I just finished a painting and it

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,780
like looks cool and now I'm gonna take a

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,700
picture and I'm gonna send it to all my

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:05,170
friends and they have to like it because

00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,540
they like me and they're my friends and

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,550
same with like coding projects are like

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,320
you know working like going through my

00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,500
mentor my manager being like I did the

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,590
thing how good is it my code like got

00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,720
proved

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,850
and you know actually like spending some

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,820
time like reminding myself that I

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,920
managed to work through it I think when

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,750
it comes to working on coding projects

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,070
this is something that I still could do

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,570
more of I sometimes I forget that I've

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,420
even done things like in university I

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,550
were a multitasking colonel for a paper

00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,140
I completely forgot about it and then

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,000
like years later I remove it and I like

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,190
ah that's actually pretty cool like

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,780
that's like kind of hardcore but I just

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,170
didn't yeah I just didn't think about it

00:23:50,780 --> 00:24:00,590
so so far I've talked about reactive

00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:05,330
measures to the way that I was feeling

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:09,920
and self soothing and working through

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:14,060
kind of ambiguous situations so this one

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,370
this slide is about being proactive and

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,740
what I mean by this is that there will

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:23,810
be life events that happens or you know

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,060
your might like move house or you know a

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:29,690
family member might fall sick you might

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:32,020
fall sick you know it's things like this

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,190
can happen and they will cause like

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,190
stress in your life there's just no

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,040
other way around that so it's really

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,880
important to make a plan to know what

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,570
you're going to do in these situations

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,400
know who you can talk to know you know

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,800
make sure that you have like the

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,420
finances to support year and these times

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,910
or at least you know knowing people who

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,550
can help you out and working with your

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,670
community your community being like your

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:01,820
friends your parents you know even other

00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,310
people who you know from work anyone

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,930
that you have like a somewhat like good

00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:08,720
relationship with and you'd be surprised

00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,330
the people that will come and help you

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,190
when you're in need so I really wanted

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,570
to include this because it's like you

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:21,470
know this is a really important aspect

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:24,010
going forward I think particularly for

00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,570
people who have experience with like

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:39,109
mental illness and stuff like that

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:44,869
and so the key takeaways or the actual

00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:46,789
key taker is so reflect on how you work

00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:49,159
not just on coding projects but also

00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:50,599
like noticing how you feel if you like

00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:52,969
go to the gym and you're lifting really

00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:56,289
heavy things or if you're like didn't

00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:58,759
building some IRT devised or if you're

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,799
you know helping somebody else with some

00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,279
project or crafting or whatever it is

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,159
baking notice notice the points where

00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,109
you start getting stressed it's really

00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,629
important to self-soothe and it's okay

00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,279
to do that I think maybe we feel like

00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:15,019
you know other people should be

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,749
comforting us but you know it's really

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,849
important for us to do that talk to

00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:22,940
other people about how you feel it's

00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:24,769
totally ok to do to do that I think you

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,739
know we may hesitate because we don't

00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:32,059
want to burden people with all of our

00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:35,479
nonsense but it's such a key thing like

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:39,429
I love it when people open up to me

00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:42,859
because I feel like you know I can

00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:44,449
listen and provide the support there hen

00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,979
and I feel really privileged that

00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,959
they've like trusted me with this

00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,089
information and that's how I feel when

00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:51,499
somebody she has stuff with me so when

00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,879
you're talking so when I'm talking to

00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:55,279
other people about my feelings I also

00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,690
like remind myself that you know maybe

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,319
that's how they're feeling right now and

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,359
that I'm not actually burdening them and

00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:07,159
you know you be surprised with is like

00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,599
common ground and if you really like the

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,459
sort of stuff that I've talked about and

00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:14,239
look up acceptance and commitment

00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:16,089
therapy or act this is a thing that's

00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:18,199
like really helps me and I found really

00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:20,179
found really good because it's very

00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:22,940
practical it's not about like

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:27,169
soul-searching the meaning of life it's

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,579
about you know what you can do next like

00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,959
I think it is important you know to

00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:31,459
think about the meaning of life but like

00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:34,279
I don't know about you but I can

00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:36,049
absolutely be lost for hours thinking

00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,959
about these kind of problems so

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,110
sometimes it's really good for me to you

00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:42,900
know be moving forward

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,080
being practical and I also wanted to

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,940
credit the artists who I had inspiration

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,610
for my painting mine's much more

00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,140
simplified version of course Chantelle

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,460
Jaden is awesome

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,230
she has like lots of really beautiful

00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:01,040
and wet-on-wet style artwork so thanks

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,040
for coming to my TED talk

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,980
thank you so much grace we're not going

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,400
to be taking questions for this talk we

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,200
don't have the time mm-hmm but thank you

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,420
