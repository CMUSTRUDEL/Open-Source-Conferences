What information do social media websites really collect and store about you? I will show you how to access that data from a few different social media pages and analyse it for your own use, even if you've never used python data analytics tools before!

all righty welcome to the second talk of

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,440
this afternoon and now we have Caitlyn

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,809
McLeod who will be talking about how you

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,730
can access and analyze your own social

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,049
media data take it away

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,670
hello everyone I'm Caitlin McLeod and

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,800
welcome to Kati Kampf PyCon au 2018

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,350
Kati Kampf is a thing run by KD

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,060
McLaughlin usually one of the organizers

00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,250
where people whose name like a similar

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,439
to ke run a conference I'm the only

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,439
Katie speaker so welcome

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,680
but anyway I'm Caitlyn McLeod I use

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,899
social media quite a bit as through a

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,940
lot of people at the moment this talk is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,559
about done loading archives of your

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,469
personal data from Twitter and from

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,670
Facebook and how I learned to use

00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,260
particular data science tool sets and

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,239
Python to analyze their data and pull

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,980
fun stats and graphs up I'll show you

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,840
some fun stats and graphs and you should

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,719
be able to come away from this talk with

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,699
ideas for what and how you can play with

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,520
your own data as well as fun ideas for

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,989
new projects and hopefully an

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,409
understanding of what I did at the same

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:12,299
time so I'm Kaitlin again like to say my

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,150
name I've been on Facebook for nearly

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,390
half my life and Twitter for a bit less

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,390
than that

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,100
they are both deeply embedded in my

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,020
personal and private lives I want to

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,450
emphasize before I really get into this

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,070
talk that I'm not a data scientist I am

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,500
not necessarily a beginner to Python

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,090
either I started doing it in high school

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,680
so I've been around for quite a long

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,470
time but I don't have a background a

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,229
data science sorry this talk is going to

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,909
focus on my experience exploring an area

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,250
of Python that I hadn't really looked at

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,570
before as well as identifying which

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,640
lessons other people should be able to

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,860
use for their own learning lessons

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,420
learning experiences and how we can all

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,219
maybe learn it help each other learn new

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,450
tools so what is what is personal data

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,740
and we're going to use this particular

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,380
phrase a bit so I'm just going to define

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,210
it right now aside from personal

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,890
information which we insert into forms

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,370
to identify ourselves and to help

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,200
websites user us and to interact with us

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,800
properly there are records of a lot of

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,020
actions that we

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,820
take online this can answer the

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,610
following questions so we've got who

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,500
we've got what did I do

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,350
where what did I search what did I look

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,700
at when do something happen so there's

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,110
usually timestamps attached to things

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,600
which can be quite useful for

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,840
circumstantial like this person did this

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,030
at this particular time and we're so

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,770
geo-tagging and IP addresses in one way

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,810
that that information can be taken out

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,420
of your actions and then sentiment

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,010
analysis so how are you feeling which is

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,520
a really popular thing for Python to do

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,860
a recent progress process progress

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,840
progress and the ability to control your

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,790
own personal information was the

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,490
European Union's general data protection

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,890
regulation this came to effect in May

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,800
2018 with huge financial penalties for

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,750
organizations that didn't comply to it

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,340
this is really useful for us even in

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,020
Australia because it means that services

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,780
had to implement like technical

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,420
processes to retrieve and provide data

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,680
and machine readable format on the right

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,510
I've got a quote from it there's a

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,150
really good website which has excerpts

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:23,100
and readable summaries of this

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:25,860
regulation at gdpr - info you really

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,860
good so the thing with personal data

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,330
using social media websites is that the

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,730
whole point of these websites is they

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,720
are interacting with other people that

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,430
means that you might be handling

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,209
sensitive data from your friends and

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,560
from people that you've interacted with

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,870
so I want you to think about these

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,280
particular aspects of this before you

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,220
start downloading your personal data

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,959
from these websites be careful whether

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,820
they're other people's information

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,650
messages are often assumed to be a

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,660
shared secret so don't release like

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,800
private conversations that people have

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,590
had with you onto the Internet in the in

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,239
the interests of like free data be

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,190
careful even about basic information

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,590
from other people that you know they may

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,720
be trying to hide from people who have

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,580
malicious intent stored some online you

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,230
shouldn't necessarily have a knowledge

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,840
about that but it is a really important

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,430
aspect but also this can be really great

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,500
for helping you come up with project

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,000
ideas because you're interacting other

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,740
people there's a lot of different things

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,260
you can do that I'll stalking with Jack

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,050
Massey over lunch who did a real cool

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,139
thing he took his messages

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,030
with his girlfriend from Facebook and he

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,310
made an infographic bookmark out of key

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,439
analytic takeaways really cool and

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,990
exciting right but also be careful about

00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,020
that some people may not be appreciative

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,779
of you doing that to their data so maybe

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,710
ask consent or just be really excited

00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:52,259
about it and hope that they're also

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:53,460
excited about it so one of the key

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,620
takeaways I want you to come away with

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,300
and that you can use like right away is

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,689
how you can download your information

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,219
from particular social sites Facebook is

00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,650
our really friendly and Wolfram boated

00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,180
interface to allow you to do this I've

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,740
got the link on my slides but you can

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,590
also find at the top of your settings

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:15,900
and privacy menu so this is your

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,430
settings book menu up the top we've got

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,939
highlighted to download your Facebook

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,830
information go to this particular link

00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,349
when you get there it gives you a set of

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,499
options down the bottom so it's got a

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,789
date range format and media quality all

00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,379
really good if you don't want to

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,909
download a huge amount of data on a

00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,909
particular conferences public and

00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:38,099
Internet so if you are going to download

00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,750
stuff for projects in the next like 24

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,860
hours

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:48,120
try and reduce the amount of data that

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:49,919
you're downloading there's a lot of data

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,439
in the results that you get from

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,439
Facebook so the download is if it's

00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,939
quite big I have a 24 like I have a 64

00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,229
gigabyte hard drive on my computer so I

00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,569
have an external hard drive that I've

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,979
had to do everything on life is very

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,279
hard there are 25 different top level

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,589
folders in the Facebook download some of

00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,000
which might be empty and some of which

00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:13,680
such as the messages one have like a

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,899
thousand different folders for each

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,849
method message conversation it also

00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,110
includes the pictures and the voice

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,080
clips that you've shared with the things

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,210
leading to some really good memories

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,370
such as my facebook my friend from my

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,639
family's conversation where we

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,659
occasionally just say things like hello

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,659
record that and send it to each other

00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,860
yes so there's a lot of data in it a

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:43,469
particular note in this is 1,100

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,689
six messages whereas in like location

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:55,740
there are zero JSON files there because

00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:57,810
I turned that off the next one is

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,729
downloading from Twitter this one is

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,680
also pretty easy but it doesn't give you

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,810
as much there's a website here called

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,509
your Twitter data you can access that in

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,030
your menu in your settings menu by going

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,919
on the Left there's a your Twitter data

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,150
setting there you can also just download

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,259
it straight from the bottom but I can't

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,449
do that anymore because I've requested

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:20,250
it too often on this particular website

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,169
they don't necessarily let you download

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,389
everything about you but they show you a

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,219
lot of information such as your

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,069
interests and who's advertising to you

00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:31,229
it also shows you of age field which is

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:34,610
wrong or like not wrong it's may be

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:36,900
correct but it's not very specific

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,719
apparently I'm both between thirteen and

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,759
fifty-four and also greater than 65 I'm

00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:49,529
glad that they've narrowed down that I'm

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,789
not 55 to 65 yeah I've done the bottom

00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,310
of that page there's a download your

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:57,000
Twitter butter Twitter button Twitter

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,199
data button as well as periscope but

00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,849
they don't let you download your images

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,680
from Twitter images which I'm not quite

00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:06,089
sure about so it takes a little while to

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,449
prepare and then it gives you a zip file

00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:11,699
with a single CSV file one CSV file with

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,589
all your tweets it's in the same format

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,300
as you get from the Twitter API which is

00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,150
really useful because a lot of people

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,520
use the Twitter API so you've already

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,830
got a lot of information to go up so now

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,750
you have the data a really interesting

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,909
idea to keep in mind when thinking about

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,060
social media sites is one that I

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:33,360
actually got from a lecture last yeah

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,370
lasya at Anu so it was a design course

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,479
but it was a design course about the

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,449
internet so the idea is the fundamental

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,709
design of a sites interaction

00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:45,149
interactions defines and shapes the

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,449
interactions and the use of the platform

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,130
as well as the infrastructure behind it

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:51,750
it also shapes the form of data that we

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,250
I'm going to get back and what

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,190
interesting information I can get out of

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,050
that so what's the

00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,850
about what particular websites are made

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,800
out of in a second understanding the

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,420
underlying data structure of these sites

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,280
isn't just useful if I understand that

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,350
culture it'll help them we'll get to

00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,000
looking at the data so first off let's

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:18,440
look at the original ideas and

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,510
frameworks behind Twitter so users first

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,920
unchangeable tweets you can never edit

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,640
your tweets on Twitter you can delete

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,740
them you can post a new one exactly the

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,320
same as second later but it will not be

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,480
the original tweet they have changed

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,520
these are public by default although

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,160
they added extra controls around that

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,110
later relationships in Twitter are

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,510
represented by following or being

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,550
followed by and you can mention reply to

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,220
retweet and like tweet through other

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,530
users 2008 is pretty simple at its face

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,350
and a great target for data analysis for

00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:56,150
that particular reason Facebook on the

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,520
other hand has so many features oh it

00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,410
has a really useful Wikipedia page about

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,570
features and when they were added which

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,680
I love I refer to that several time so

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,170
while I was doing this and I heard

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,820
favorited the citations so we're going

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,060
to focus on the basics for now so what

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,100
it started off us so first off you can

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,030
post on your own timelines or other

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,820
people's timelines if you want you can

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,370
represent friendships with friendships

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,200
relationships with friendships and you

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,900
can action those relationships with like

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,690
reacting by commenting sharing tagging

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,190
posting there's a lot of other stuff on

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,250
Facebook for that so I'm gonna really go

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,630
in for now messaging structures so we

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,550
use messages a lot on both these

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,460
platforms are pretty similar across

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,870
ropes that I'm just putting it together

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,120
the basic difference is in the like

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,650
definitions of relationships twitter

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,390
focuses on following instead of

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,800
friendships but also messenger recently

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,500
added like contacts instead of

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,300
friendships so you don't have to be a

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,000
friend on Facebook to be a contact on

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,230
messenger I'll bring this back up again

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,930
so don't worry about remembering

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,750
everything about each platform but let's

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,839
get to onto doing some analyzing sorry

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,820
I've downloaded the data I don't know

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,819
what to do if the data I would like

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,619
scrolled through the

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,569
used to be in Excel so I know what's in

00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:15,269
there and I opened up some adjacent

00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:16,859
vials and like opened up some pictures

00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,609
that I said there were a lot of cat

00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:22,829
pictures no surprise I knew about the

00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:24,299
idea of pandas matplotlib and natural

00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:26,269
language processing in Python and I

00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:30,059
wanted to try those out so I downloaded

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,569
at the Anaconda distribution which comes

00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,739
in with a lot of really cool stuff

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,720
including driven and notebooks which is

00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:40,919
how I've actually been working on this

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,869
stuff so we've got anaconda is the

00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,079
distribution driven and notebooks is

00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:48,209
like a really cool way of intermingling

00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,069
code and also map down and then we've

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,419
got the national language toolkit which

00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:54,389
I haven't actually used in the

00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,769
matplotlib I've also used a numpy and a

00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:00,869
little bit of handers but I'd love to

00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,919
learn more about pandas so first off

00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,689
we'll look at twin it it's really D

00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,429
let's see it's me file as I mentioned

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,049
before there's not a whole lot of stuff

00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:11,609
in it there's like eight columns and

00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:15,959
then several tweets many tweets maybe

00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:17,220
like four thousand tweets but yes so

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,850
it's fundamentally about your own

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,299
profile public data is commonly used to

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,369
research trends usage patterns sentiment

00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,689
and there's only data in this archive

00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,569
about tweets so there's nothing about

00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:34,559
reactions likes following people nothing

00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:37,139
about that so first off I wanted to get

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:42,319
the tweets into some format that I could

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:45,720
use I found a library called CSV great

00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:47,009
but yes so you open the file you read it

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,319
into a dictionary because I love

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,029
dictionaries and then you count how many

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:54,239
tweets you have which is four thousand

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,979
six hundred and sixty-four tweets I've

00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:57,329
got an example of one of the

00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,519
dictionaries that it pulls out for you

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,769
here which is my most recent tweet one

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,119
actually did this which is talking about

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:08,669
a cool tip for said if you like said you

00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:12,689
can replace lashes with hashes or like

00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:15,029
various characters I love it and it's

00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:18,059
real good it also tells you who you're

00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,929
replying to you and like what tweet

00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:22,740
you're replying to but not actually

00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:26,040
putting this up

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,020
it doesn't do in reply to user ad like

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,570
using a handle the uses a true using

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:34,200
their user ad I never really bothered to

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,970
relate that to an actual user so first

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,330
off I wanted to make a histogram of

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,370
tweets so basically just a frequency to

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,930
the histogram could say during this

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,430
particular amount of time I did this

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:50,150
many tweets the next of the next and I

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,260
wanted to specify the time period so

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,170
here are some cool tips that I found

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,840
daytime daytime does strip time that's

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,120
trippy time is a function to pass a

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,820
four-minute string and to a daytime

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,280
daytime pandas actually does state

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,320
ranges for you I didn't use this but it

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:12,870
can be like it generates dates during a

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,490
particular range so that you can think

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,140
about making those buckets yourself but

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,060
then I found out that actually mat flat

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,240
live does that entirely so you can use a

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,030
histogram and mat float lid and put them

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:34,350
all together I've just realized I've

00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:40,710
caused my timer hmm alright so but then

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:43,790
I also ran into some some efficiency I'm

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,020
using a MacBook Air it's not very fast

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,740
Mac pop lid sometimes takes a bit of

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,630
work so I converted at my time my time

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,580
stamps and to actually just the Mac

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,650
bullet lived on Tate's dates time time

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,700
format which is a number real easy so

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,110
here are the histograms that I came up

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,580
with I can show you the code in a bit

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,980
but I'll show you the code for a couple

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,470
of other things with Facebook I made a

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,960
lot of tweets so I signed up in 2011 as

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,970
I mentioned earlier this is over 500

00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,620
tweets in like less than six months on a

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,540
previous one it said that I had over a

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,400
thousand in my first year I think most

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,400
of those are directed at my friend Livy

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah I think we were just really excited

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,450
by Twitter at the time a lot of these

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,040
are probably also conference tweets so

00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,400
the next piece of information that I

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,360
wanted to get out of it was mentioning

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,950
different peoples

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,420
I have a sister and I have a friend who

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,390
used Twitter and I have a lot of other

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,920
people that I talked to because I didn't

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,680
have following or anything like that in

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,089
the CSV I wanted to get out anything

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,209
that I could get out about other people

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:55,380
for that for me that was mentioned so

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:56,310
I've got three steps that I've been

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,380
following from most of these things

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,200
which is one identify what data

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,399
structure I want to get this data into

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,350
that was kind of hard for me because I

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,899
didn't know what graphing tools they

00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,510
could be using as I often changed that

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,490
goal a few times throughout and then I

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,380
want to extract the necessary chart into

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,000
that format and then I wanted to make a

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,529
picture or a table or something like

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,810
that

00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,670
first off I wanted to make a table

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,529
well histogram I just like coffee of the

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:27,630
code from the previous thing and I did

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:29,100
exactly that that was terrible ah first

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,230
off it took a long time this is only

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,720
like a thousand people that I've

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,970
mentioned I've mentioned a lot of people

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,170
and you can't read it people shouldn't

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:46,170
be made into categories history grabs

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:50,910
had not made for people so I didn't do

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,500
that and even one next stuff I decided

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,839
that I just wanted to get the data out

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,000
some way so I just made a print

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,480
statement and I took the top people out

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
of that

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:05,370
so my first stuff I've got my sister

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,929
Marion Mex flat 642 my friend Livi 617 I

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,699
should know that this doesn't count

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:10,829
capitalization so I haven't actually

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,480
figured out who won

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:17,669
it also doesn't count when they changed

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,020
the user names so there's a lot of

00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,760
interesting stuff on that I think a lot

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,049
of these are like conversations I'm not

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:27,360
sure why I've got a hundred and five

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:31,200
with myself I don't think I talked to

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,080
myself on the internet very much but is

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,370
there and there were 836 user names that

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,770
I only mentioned once there might be

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,679
people that I've just retweeted ones or

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,090
people that like oh hey because a typo

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,460
on your website that's all the

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:50,430
conversation we're gonna have so

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,080
next up I wanted to figure out what else

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,910
I could get it out of this or like it

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,730
more useful thing than the previous

00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:03,300
histogram so I made a also pretty bad

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,220
histogram using a sorted list of my top

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,610
mentions the top people that I've

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:13,500
mentioned we can see here the libyan

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,820
meirin a pretty close here's the

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,250
slightly better one so I just took it

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,730
down in the top 25 so you can actually

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,160
read them I heard and there we go

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,740
I also changed the color the birth

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Goodfellas the my next project that I

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,130
want to do with my Twitter data is

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,640
sentiment analysis but I didn't do that

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,530
if anyone wants to hang out on a on a

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,150
sprint day I'm here on Monday and teach

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,660
me how to do send to an analysis that

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,210
would be lovely

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,860
I really want to get the feelings in

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,300
relation to particular hash tags I've

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,340
used a lot of conference hashtags over

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,340
my life on Twitter and that'll be really

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,470
nice next off we've got my facebook data

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,230
so Facebook as I mentioned earlier so

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,300
many data a lot of data

00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,160
I haven't there's a lot that I can still

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,210
do with this and for this one I'm

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,530
actually going to show you the Drupa de

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,660
notebook that I've been using sorry it's

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,590
not live coding don't worry I've already

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,750
run it I intermittent intermingled my

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,190
Drupada notebooks stuff with comments

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,380
about what I want out of the next piece

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,480
of data notes about what I found in from

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,220
interesting during that time and then

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:26,910
also comments I don't think I've got any

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:30,630
swear words in there there might be but

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,980
yet so basically if you want to use this

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,500
particular dreaded notebook I'm going to

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,440
release all this you can replace this

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,000
with a path name to your own Facebook

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,590
download

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,910
I'll figure out the categories for you

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:47,160
and then hope they match what I've typed

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:48,570
in manually myself but yeah so you can

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,150
write down with you don't load this

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,470
yourself this is some complicated data

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,060
about trying to figure out how many

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,130
folders there are and how many JSON

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,510
files there are at some point I wanted

00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,110
to figure out how many pictures there

00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,400
were I did

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,390
get around to it there'll be a nice

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,270
thing to do but yes so the first thing I

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,650
wanted to do with Facebook was figure

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,980
out how many reacts I've done I have a

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:13,140
hypothesis that I did a lot of love

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,070
reacts I'm a lot of cat groups love

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,770
reacts the compulsory I'm not gonna

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,760
spoil the result the reaction format

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,500
looks like this so you've got the

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,410
timestamp you've got the data with the

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,970
reaction love and the actually at cable

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,559
and chai McLeod my name is Caitlin chime

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,210
McLeod on Facebook it used to be Caitlin

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,520
Chimecho Lottie but they didn't let me

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:39,169
keep that and as we can see I reacted to

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,200
a Whitaker's chocolate lover's video

00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:44,340
which is the New Zealand chocolate

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,900
reacts doesn't like four introduced

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,150
pretty recently in this one so I

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,429
expected a lot of love reacts but not as

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:54,900
many as love the like reacts because it

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,820
was so long yeah so first off I just

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,110
loaded the JSON file up this one with

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,049
the one JSON file for your ex which is

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,280
the other reason why I like this example

00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,130
the first-century looks like this one

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,929
which looks a lot like the Jason because

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,250
Jason is very similar to dictionaries

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,760
and Python data types

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,340
I had 33,000 likes of reactions in this

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,640
category that's a fair amount of data

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,350
for me tiding birthday so I'm gonna try

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,220
and reduce the scope as soon as possible

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:26,549
so first off I want to extract just the

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,630
timestamps in the reaction type just a

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,830
side note there's gonna be a lot of

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,330
common to that code that didn't work in

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,890
here yeah because I wasn't gonna get

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,250
repository I wanted to keep the history

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,610
of all the ways that I messed up so

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,410
here's the matplotlib stem dates thing

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,270
dates thing a thing that I learned about

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,620
all these libraries is that they've all

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,290
got different ways that you should

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,510
import their things when you're using

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,640
like an umpire it's like Oh import numpy

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,630
is NP when you're using that flipped a

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,210
pipe ler you're like

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,970
import Metzler LibDem and don't pipe lot

00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:01,410
as PLT there's not something beginners

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,809
pick up so I've got lambdas we couldn't

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,400
love lenders but first off I have a list

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,200
I've confirmed that the list has content

00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,980
in it which i think is an important

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,070
thing and it has a timestamp of the

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,290
first

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,300
that I ever did I don't know what the

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:21,160
timestamp is it's an ephod time format

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:24,100
I'll look at it later but yes so non pie

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,660
as I mentioned numpy as MP numpy dot

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,120
unique gives you a really nice format of

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,980
unique things with account next to them

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,180
it's similar to a command line tool icon

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:40,120
of a news called unique - C which is

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,640
really good and then I've sort it

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:47,050
together zip them apart together again

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,550
and then sort it a bit so I've put the

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,140
counts up next with my individual

00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:56,380
reactions here I've got twenty one

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:59,620
thousand likes sixty-six thousand 6600

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:02,380
sorry love's and then a few things and a

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,210
dart a few dorothy's if you're wondering

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,220
what a Dorothy is this sometimes like a

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,750
limited edition reactions that you can

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,430
do on Facebook I think this one was like

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,140
a Thanksgiving or a Mother's Day or

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,020
something and you could react to the

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,150
flower I didn't have any fried reacts in

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,440
there which I was confused about but I

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,850
don't remember if I made any so if

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,560
anyone else sees any fried reacts and

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:26,080
their reaction Jason I'd love to see

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:27,880
them but also I don't believe that data

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,250
I think I did way more loves and likes

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,250
so I'm going to cut the information down

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,970
to just after love reactions and angry

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:39,040
reactions and stuff we're introduced

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,510
I've done that using an index call just

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,650
to find the first index in it it's

00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:48,250
sorted should be pretty easy I don't

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,410
believe the results it says that I only

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,050
said 2000 reactions before other

00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:55,750
reactions were introduced also this

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,880
thing apparently I did some haha reacts

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,960
before I did and you love reacts which i

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,960
think is false

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:11,999
but what I did a loading by lorry

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:14,340
accident was wrong sorry yes so as we

00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:16,769
can see still a lot of like reacts I

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,320
guess it makes a bit of sense the ocean

00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:22,289
this isn't just reacts to posts it also

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,080
reacts to comments I didn't really

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:26,399
filter that out sorry I guess I like a

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,989
lot of comments and I like a lot of

00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:36,330
things sorry my other stuff is all to do

00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:38,129
which is great in the Renault type I

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,769
also want to figure out the membership

00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:42,480
of my messenger groups over time a

00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:44,340
really interesting piece of at my

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,320
facebook data is I'm a member of a like

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,909
several year long forty press and

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,789
Facebook group this is southern

00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:51,720
university it's called beer o'clock at

00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,869
the moment I think it's called like

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,059
virtual cute party which is great it's

00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,190
been carefully curated over time there's

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,720
a lot of people still in there full of

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,509
lovely supportive people and just

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,119
generally nice and I would really like

00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:08,639
to see like the messages over time who's

00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,879
engaged so if anyone wants to help me

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,639
with that

00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:14,309
I'm gonna date that would also be lovely

00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:16,529
sorry that's how I analyze my facebook

00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:18,779
there's a lot of other stuff that more

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:23,100
people can do on it and a lot of stuff

00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:25,559
that you can do about it yourself but

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,779
basically or just to jump back for a

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,159
minute Facebook is the structure of

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,470
Facebook as I mentioned is really

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,679
complicated the archive 25 different

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,299
folders the format the basic stuff is

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,840
the posts but there's a lot of other

00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,489
things in there as well so there's just

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,399
a lot that you can do I barely scratch

00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:46,169
the form at the surface it's quite hard

00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,389
to query it an API is a bit harder than

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,470
Twitter so it's not done as much but

00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:52,340
there's still some literature out there

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,529
about analyzing your own Facebook stuff

00:25:52,340 --> 00:26:00,619
yeah so my reactions that was a sparkly

00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:00,619
emoji it got away my sparkly emoji

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,309
cheated

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,220
yeah in terms of takeaways for yourself

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,570
you can download your data from pretty

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,220
much everywhere that doesn't want to be

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:19,760
sued by the European Union I've put

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,920
links to a few of the download places of

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,450
particularly common websites here

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,850
Facebook and Twitter as I mentioned

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,690
pretty easy to grow through Google a lot

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,970
of data

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,900
I haven't downloaded this one but I'm

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,640
interested

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,100
I expect a lot of advertising

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,870
information from them Instagram I don't

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,610
use it so it's not really relevant to me

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,840
but they definitely have it you can

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,420
actually download your own myspace

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,820
account you have to login to myspace

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,130
classic via their myspace stuff which is

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,630
very complicated so I didn't download it

00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,670
but it's there

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,290
snapchat as long as you've got an email

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,550
linked to your account then you can

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,590
download the information from their

00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:58,590
tumblr since they got you bought by

00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,970
Yahoo there's really complicated you

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,490
have to like log in through a yo few

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:08,820
page and then figure out what's going on

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:10,440
okay slack it's quite hard to download

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,030
your own information but there's an

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,740
add-on that you can add to your slack

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,480
workspace to allow people to download

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,070
their all their own stuff

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,380
Ubbe you actually have to use a web

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:23,910
scraper they have a interface that you

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,070
can go to you to look at your rides in

00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,290
the past and then you have to download

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,610
each of those pages manually LinkedIn of

00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,920
a surprisingly good at letting you

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,810
download your information and I want to

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,940
see how many times have uploaded all my

00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:40,590
contacts without my permission but yet

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,970
I'm sure there's a lot more there

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,200
because it's not just social media sites

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,430
that you can download your information

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,410
from it's anything that has your

00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:53,250
personal data on it which is a lot of

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:56,310
places and yeah so here are my sources

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,870
this is pretty basic stuff I put a lot

00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,580
of the Stack Overflow links that I used

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,590
into that it was dripping in our books

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,330
there's a lot of tabs open at my other

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,620
windows that I'm gonna have to put in as

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,490
well so the derivative notebooks would

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,920
be out for a couple days but yeah thank

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,450
you um I think I guess maybe one

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,130
question yes thank you so much for your

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,110
talking we have time for a few questions

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:30,029
but let's first beaver

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:32,690
pose the question this is a little bit

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:35,970
of a switch on the topic Thank you very

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,730
do you know if there are ways that we

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,769
can so you talked about ways that we can

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,500
access and read our data you know if

00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:48,419
there are ways that we can write that we

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,679
can like board like delete old things if

00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,809
we wanted to lead a lot of stuff at once

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,840
or of dqo type of thing yes

00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,549
so the gdpr had a requirement that

00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,110
you'll be able to delete your data from

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,330
their service and for that to be

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,370
automated so there isn't that website

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,440
should meet maybe it should make it

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,630
possible for you to do it it might not

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,889
be easy I know a lot of websites you

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,200
have to actually email them for them to

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,559
do it properly so it may not be easy I

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,159
haven't looked into her myself

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,159
any other questions

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:29,360
is is this the actual data stored in the

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:32,180
Facebook servers or Twitter servers like

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,550
is this the actual data I reckon the

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,260
Facebook stuff is it's just messy enough

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,460
that it looks like it's part of

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,770
something else it's like it's actually

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,300
part of the data base but the Twitter

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,190
stuff I reckon it's just an export

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,440
it's just the display that they do on it

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,730
Facebook didn't also didn't give me like

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,140
the amount of time that I've spent

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,550
scrolling through videos which i think

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,170
is quite important and I think that they

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:56,930
track that and I would love to know how

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:59,090
much I wasted so it's not everything but

00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,710
I think it's enough to comply I know

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,270
that things like Spotify you can email

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:05,540
them to get more data than they give on

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:09,530
the automated interface yeah so it's not

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,510
everything and if you do delete

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,870
something like does it get deleted on

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:17,810
the actual Facebook server itself

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:19,010
that'd be sued so quickly if not but I

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,570
know that they leave a lot of stuff and

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,100
other people's databases but it just

00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,050
gets replaced with like Facebook user

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,880
I've got a lot of conversations that it

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:30,770
just with Facebook user thank you all

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,520
righty that's all we have time for let's

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,520
think Caitlyn again

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,530
and I have a lot to give you it has a

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,530
