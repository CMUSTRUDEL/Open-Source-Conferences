welcome John Palace to the stage he will

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,750
be talking about Chromebooks and the

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,389
Chromebook coding with Chromebooks John

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,139
is a teacher of physics and ite learning

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,270
leader from mount Lilydale

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:21,359
Mercy College he likes playing with

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,670
micro bits raspberry PI's make us stuff

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:31,590
generally also is a beer brewer and also

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:35,130
likes concise bios so John please tell

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,140
us about Chromebooks thank you um this

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,870
talks about our journey we had a problem

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,090
we needed to solve it and this is what

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,670
we did so you're faced with a similar

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,460
situation you may find inspiration in

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,500
what we did and realize that you work

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,539
hard enough you'll get there a little

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,690
bit about my school

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,590
the co-educational Catholic ran about

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,800
1,500 students there's a vineyard

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,470
on-site there's a there's a farm and

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,189
every year there's a vintage red wine

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,640
that they produce they show the animals

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,130
at the show so it's it's quite quite an

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,680
interesting place to work we're also a

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,850
googol school Geoff's week for education

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,290
and Chromebooks are at 7 and 8 MacBooks

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,020
some 9 and 10 and in terms of our IT

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,380
classes you seven they only do one

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,549
semester and it's a maximum of 20 hours

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,939
and in that 20 hours they do probably 5

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,270
hours of coding and that's used to be

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,939
scratch we've moved on down where we're

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,720
trying to implement Python and you're

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,899
right there's no itare classes at all

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:56,610
then you 7 uses 9 to 12 we have the

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:59,189
standard electives now our problem was

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,460
the Victorian curriculum it came in and

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:06,380
said there's digital technologies and

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:11,550
you need to teach explicit IT content

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:13,290
especially coding where Archaea 7

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,329
because we had that

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,780
small period of time to do that but in

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:21,000
here right we didn't have anything so we

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,590
had to that was their problem how do we

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,819
integrate the digital technologies

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,909
curriculum into year right so we hit

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:33,030
four subject areas textiles humanities

00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:36,959
science and what I'm talking about today

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,840
is maths and we chose to teach digital

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,849
technologies particular aspect of it in

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
the maths class science to do something

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:48,989
else humanities do something else and so

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,329
do the textiles class with the

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,669
curriculum there's these content

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:57,840
descriptors and that was a Content

00:02:53,669 --> 00:03:00,269
descriptors which were targeted to do in

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,879
the maths class and we think that

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,560
there's several elaborations and look at

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,189
those elaborations and say yep this is

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,470
what I can do so when you look at that

00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,209
develop and modified digital solutions

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,340
by implementing instructions contained

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,519
in algorithms using a programming

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,720
language I just read that as create some

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,549
code and you solve a problem developing

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,699
a digital game that manipulates the

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:30,810
models of real-world objects programming

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:33,569
a robot and so forth so we went through

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,930
the curriculum and said that's what we

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:41,729
need to do let's code which other area

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:44,519
in the school can can can do that and we

00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,780
picked on maths because there was an

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,319
area in there which they had to

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,409
calculate areas of rectangles circles

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,940
and so forth

00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:56,280
after that it was which programming

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,000
language and I don't need to tell you

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,780
paper why Partin but we chose Python

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,540
because it's just easy it really is easy

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,220
for beginners and one of the humanities

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,229
teachers said it right he said you use

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,669
Python and straightaway the kids get a

00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,269
feeling of success because it works

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:18,959
anything to just print something out

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:21,450
print hello bang it works success and a

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,510
lot of the kids had success straightaway

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,730
in the maths and the IT part when they

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,270
hadn't had success in where else

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,610
and I thought great and I went all that

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,650
we didn't do scratch because their

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,560
expectation is in the Victorian

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,950
curriculum that's a g6 level and primary

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,440
school

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:45,630
so in u7 they've got to start doing a

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,600
text based language we also like typing

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,670
because it's flexible you can use it

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,660
pears papaya physical computing micro

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:58,050
bit physical computing and then later on

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,750
and these nine and ten do some object

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:05,070
work with it so it's versatile in that

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:08,670
regard as well these are our

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,960
requirements just the the main ones had

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,480
to work in a browser

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,900
Chromebooks just don't allow you to

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,160
install anything I think now Google are

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,780
stopping that anyway they're not letting

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,430
you install apps or they're getting rid

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,910
of apps and there's some other way of

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,070
running it I don't know so we had

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:30,870
limitations of the this the the software

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,570
the screen size processing power it will

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,760
also need to be available off-site

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,340
there's no point creating a situation

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,070
where the only time kids can do some

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,530
coding is at school

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,190
so again they needed to do it off-site

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:50,100
to be able to do their work simple

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,440
number one if it's not simple forget it

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,500
that's the way I look at things all the

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,770
time and it has to be easy we've got

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,190
different levels of confidence of

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,250
teachers and staff and students varying

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,670
degrees of success with IIT so it had to

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,610
be simple and easy and we want a

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,870
graphics and text in one place I didn't

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,230
want to use a piece of software that

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,730
wouldn't allow me to do that and when

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,610
we're doing the investigating we found a

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:25,830
few online sites which just wouldn't do

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:28,080
it there was issues what we decide on

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,500
Trinket you've already heard about it

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,660
today and just there's a tip to make the

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,040
free version of Trinket run in Python 3

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,440
just putting that little bit of code

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,460
there and it will run it and in part in

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,030
3 mode so you won't have to pay for it

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,159
we tried lots of different systems my

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,710
preferred option was the Jupiter hub and

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:51,919
jupiter notebooks they just brilliant

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,690
they really are and I just couldn't do

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,000
it because I'm just not that good at

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,860
getting these things up and running we

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,210
needed to do it on a budget of zero

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,680
dollars so Trinket worked out I probably

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,360
could have run Jupiter huh burn

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,069
notebooks on a paid subscription service

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,479
but we just couldn't do it and being

00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:15,229
able to break code up into little

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,330
segments and run it in a small applet

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,819
like you're doing Jupiter notebook was

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,830
just superb these are other couple of

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,219
websites they're they're good but

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,979
they're just didn't suit our purpose the

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:31,159
coding with chrome app is also good it

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:33,259
just doesn't suit and I think as I said

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,509
I think Google's stopping that ability

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,219
to install apps or it's phasing it out

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,370
or something so I didn't want to start

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:42,680
with something that didn't go anywhere

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:47,440
and grok learning they've actually got

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,930
something for I think it's g7 mats and

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,990
we're targeting me right and so that's

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,150
why we didn't go there but drop learning

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:01,190
is great to extend the kids and give

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:04,639
them challenges to do it this is one of

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:09,080
those websites which couldn't display or

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,210
couldn't run both turtle and text at the

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,469
same time it just came up and gave me an

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,520
error blank screen

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,440
so I had this particular script that's

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,509
what I wanted the kids to be able to do

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,069
something along these lines and I'll run

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,069
that through several different websites

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:27,110
nothing happened until you got to drink

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:29,870
it and then you can get your circle

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,829
drawn and text written on it and an

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:37,250
output provided all in the one space now

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,949
that's pretty good it's pretty good you

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,019
know kids can then draw their squares

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:45,410
draw their triangles draw their arm

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:51,470
circles and write about it at the same

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:53,270
time and just earlier today I thought

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,070
how would it look on the phone

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,600
so I tried it on the phone it actually

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,800
works on the phone as well

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,149
it's not ideal but some of these kids

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,220
have got a phone that's twice the size

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:08,240
of my phone so they might actually be

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:13,029
able to work quite successfully on it

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,770
who knows but it's worth having a look

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,470
these are some sample trick trinkets

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,959
I've put up for you to have a look at if

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,300
you want to copy down those URLs or I

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,640
will just go to them anyway and talk a

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,510
little bit about them as to how we went

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,740
about it

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,709
[Music]

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,190
circle area ones this one mean all right

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:38,750
let's run it down here enter the radius

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,709
of a circle this is the sort of thing we

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,570
expected our kids to do and it will do

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,279
it all in one in the Chromebook and it

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,730
just works

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,740
Asuna kids to comment their code to

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,950
demonstrate their understanding of what

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,520
was going on with trinket as well you

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,459
could ask it to fire up and present the

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,899
instructions straight away so you could

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:06,500
give them some theory work on

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,120
conditionals for instance or you can

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,670
give them problems like this one where

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,570
Hey look there's a logic error go

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,899
through fix it and show us what the

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:22,670
issue is so they're the just some

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:26,450
examples of how trinket looks you don't

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,920
need to sign up you can if you wish a

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,829
lot of the kids did it anyway because

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,779
it's a where Google school and trinkets

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:37,450
got a sign in with your Google button

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:42,170
all the kids just pressed it and went in

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,790
so I surveyed the kids afterwards and

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,360
asked them and I kept it they put into

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:50,779
their work and are honest a lot of them

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,300
said yep we tried I don't find kids an

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,110
issue they don't once you hold things

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:59,149
back you know what the answer is

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,240
then I ask them about they math skill

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:06,380
before and after that the topic that we

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,100
did a lot of them said they learn maths

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,740
while doing it

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,140
and that was a key thing if we couldn't

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,360
get the kids to learn their maths at the

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,670
same time as learning their digital

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,130
technologies curriculum it was a failure

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,020
so I look at that and I think at least

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,610
the kids know that they're learning some

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,330
maths at the same times learning some

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:30,440
code and this was their Python skill and

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:34,550
knowledge a lot of them had zero skill

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,500
in Python at the end of it it's pleasing

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,040
the seat a lot of them thought they were

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,510
actually good at Python and there's

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,340
still some of them who don't know

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,420
anything about it that's okay they're

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:51,500
kids they're allowed to whether they

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,790
enjoyed it or not and again you look at

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:59,720
one end of it wasn't too bad it wasn't

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:02,300
too bad and in terms of level of

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,820
difficulty seemed to be accessible to

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:11,150
them and they were able to do the work

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,500
and get some success out of it and then

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,400
I thought I'd ask him you know what

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,230
would you do next

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,670
what would you like us to do next time

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,350
we do it and really good to see that

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,410
some of them said nothing don't change

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:29,240
anything others said less coding you

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,710
know others said less maths I that's

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,160
that's what I love about teaching kids

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,440
is they just straight up and down but

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,140
the biggest thing was make it clearer

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,180
and and that's that's our fault that's

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,180
that's that's not just the way we did it

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,170
one of the staff members produced some

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,150
work and it was follow the instructions

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,100
and type it into your computer a lot of

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,810
the kids just couldn't read it didn't

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,640
understand it just wasn't clear they

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,010
didn't know why they were doing it they

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,240
just needed to be put into context for

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,890
him so articulate the purpose provide

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,930
better worksheets for us next time

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,240
making sure that there's probably more

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,340
visuals on there for them and provide

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,720
alternate resources you know so don't go

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,240
to grok learning and do some of the

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,100
challenges there or the ICA or there's

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,980
other websites out there which that

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,360
provide

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:27,710
resources for them to learn on their own

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:31,670
or provide some challenges the other

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:35,750
things that attracted my attention were

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,170
more activities in different area the

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,870
kids said they liked it but probably a

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,040
little bit repetitive for them how many

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,570
times do you have to calculate the area

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,820
of something and that's where it's

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:52,280
putting it into context is so important

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,640
and giving them a chance to apply it

00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,980
elsewhere is it financial tasks you know

00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,780
the the the payroll generator how much

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,070
pay they're gonna get from their

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:07,520
part-time job farm related our kids a

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,990
lot of kids come out from farms and yeah

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,910
they kind of do work in the morning

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,040
before they get to school

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,080
is it farm related stuff you know what's

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,310
the area of the field that they have to

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,230
do to defense I went on an excursion

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,320
with the kids and they did some wearable

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,050
technologies exercise and they had to

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,200
create some device that'll measure and

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:33,770
help someone or something so these kids

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:37,900
they show animals particularly cows so

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,700
what their solution was to put a

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,310
temperature sensor and a heart monitor

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,380
on the cow and apparently when it cows

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,630
under stress its temperature changes

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,300
probably happens to us anyway and then

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,190
that was fed back wirelessly to them on

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,930
a device and they could read it and

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,970
indicate when the cow was under stress

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,250
when it was showing at this show you

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,890
know and that's important to them and I

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,330
think it's great you know maybe we

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,240
should have done something along those

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,940
lines too to help relate it more to what

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,290
their interests are our vineyard you

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,030
know why don't to go out there and

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,490
measure them the diameter and

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,230
circumference of the grapes and maybe

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,280
take sugar readings and record it and

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,260
then do some calculations with it sports

00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:24,410
weather we've got a you know weather

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,750
station on our building and it's got

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,370
five years of weather data I don't need

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,170
to go out and pull it from the bureau I

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,220
get it right there right there and then

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,989
we've just got solar energy panels again

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,799
we could just go and pull that data off

00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:42,109
so it's context we've got to change it

00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:44,509
and maybe yet we tick the box and say we

00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:46,459
can do calculations of area but I think

00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,049
we need to do a little bit more with it

00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:54,319
to engage him a little bit more these

00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:56,540
are my challenges that we had and number

00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:01,669
one I think Linda said at the start its

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:03,859
teacher conference mmm when we first

00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,660
introduced this topic to him we showed

00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:07,069
them what it can do what was that a lot

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,139
of them said here it looks like logo

00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,980
yeah I remember that year we did that at

00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,739
uni that's good

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,489
and unfortunately that was about as much

00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:17,689
preparation as they did I thought I

00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:21,290
could go in there and just pick it up

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:24,980
and I just can't I can't as simple as it

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,419
is you've got to do more work and we

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,889
provided weekly workshops I was

00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:32,569
available every Wednesday to help I

00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:36,309
think I've got one person you know

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:36,309
turning up over a ten week period also

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:42,199
in class support it was myself and

00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:44,629
another couple of people who are willing

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,069
to go in and help well we didn't go in

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,809
to help we ended up going in there to

00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:50,089
teach the subject because often the

00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:53,929
teacher will just sit back so thank god

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:56,809
you're here go for it so it's that

00:16:53,929 --> 00:17:00,079
confidence and we're trying to get

00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:03,559
around that this next time by providing

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:10,850
a full day PD with someone other than

00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:11,689
myself to teach them and hopefully that

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,600
will give him a little bit more

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:20,120
ownership the resources was a really

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,069
contentious issue a lot of staff thought

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,880
that I just needed to give him something

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,389
and off they go

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,440
other staff thought no we need to do it

00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:33,909
and that way we get ownership and you

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,340
know we'll know what we're doing so

00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:39,409
that's still an issue still not sure how

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,960
we get around that hopefully with this

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,159
full day PD we do people walk away and

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,919
have a little bit more ownership about

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,420
it but as it was one person created the

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,640
resources and everyone else used

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,910
same resource and it was basically I

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,820
let's just follow the instructions we

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,320
just need to do a better job but in all

00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,260
of that there's no technical

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,200
difficulties the Chromebook and the web

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,780
Python in a web browser no technical

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,200
difficulties it just works which is just

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,800
superb absolutely superb challenges from

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,400
the student perspective reading they

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
can't

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,350
well I can't either I can't read from a

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,850
screen and then typing another one we

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,250
thought initially we'll just put our

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,580
resources online and so they can read it

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,090
and then open up another tab and then

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:32,060
start typing can't do it one our screen

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,820
size is only 11 inch and two kids have

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,820
difficulty reading and typing and three

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,360
they just started a copy and paste which

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,240
defeats the purpose so that's why we

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,070
printed out those documents and then

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
there are messages whenever they did get

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,710
an error

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,520
they wouldn't read it I said what's

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:56,150
wrong did you read it not well have a

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,830
read and once I start reading and seeing

00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,360
an error message and then seeing more of

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,110
them they can then work it out but they

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,780
just don't read and then spelling

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:09,380
spelling it just needs to improve across

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,860
the board syntax errors you know just

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,860
doesn't stop

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:19,910
ultimately this is what we're hoping to

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:22,520
do help these students become confident

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,990
learners using digital systems and use

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,410
this computational thinking in all

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,330
subject areas not just maths and that's

00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,200
why we're trying to implement it in

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:36,290
science and humanities and textiles so

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,070
that's our story hopefully you can learn

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,600
something from it

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,600
and happy to take questions

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,640
[Applause]

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:56,920
fantastic thank you so much John

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:58,420
questions sorry you may have answered

00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,500
this already but I'm curious because I

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,880
seem to remember at the beginning you

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,230
explained to us that you had that

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,370
problem with Chromebooks because it was

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,810
used seven and eight and then the

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,330
students used I think Mac books after

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,010
that did you have the students continue

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,950
on with trinket or did they move on to

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:16,110
other environments as their first year

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,110
doing it does that first you doing it

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:25,270
I'm tempted to keep going but yeah I'm

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,240
not sure yet but when you look at

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,160
trinket you can actually import lots of

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,830
different modules you can put the math

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,150
module turtle module I think I think you

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,880
can actually do some plotting as well

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,340
I'm not sure but the random module so

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:47,250
you can exit do a fair bit in trinket

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:52,030
and they're gonna learn it in u7y right

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:53,440
yeah I'm not sure yet not sure you I'll

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:59,740
give it a go next year and see how it

00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:02,050
happens you talked about students having

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,470
trouble with spelling and that producing

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,810
sint syntax errors I'm wondering how

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,790
much of it is a lack of ability at

00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,370
spelling and how much is a lack of

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,310
keyboard skills yeah I think it's both I

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,650
think the spot-on you see kids even with

00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,740
their mac books or their Chromebooks

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:24,790
they're doing this all the time they do

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,830
not sit there and use two hands to type

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,560
they're using two fingers and in our use

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,310
seven high tech classes we do get them

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,160
to do practice typing one of those

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,140
online typing competitions and they get

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,750
certificates and we encourage it

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,240
constantly but once it's finished they

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,670
go back to doing that and it's their

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,620
spelling it's combination absolutely

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:53,200
don't know how to fix the problem

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:54,580
just persist I'll ask a question related

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,720
to that have you have you had a

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,850
conversation about

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,950
I see capabilities with the other staff

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:04,830
the the actual question I wanted to ask

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:06,700
was you talked about getting the

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,169
integrating with other subjects with

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,059
maths and possibly with AG in the future

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:16,270
do you have support from this from other

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,340
teachers to try to integrate this into

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,470
their subjects as well yeah some of the

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,630
teachers are great they love picking up

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:28,480
a new challenge it's when you step out

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,039
of a single teacher subject to haul one

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,380
or two teachers in a subject area and

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,419
you have to go in to 10 to choose in a

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,130
subject area that you feel that inertia

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:40,960
and resistance but having said that once

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,100
people seen what the students can

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,200
achieve with this

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,870
they are actually quite positive about

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,270
it and they've actually chosen to do

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,200
another topic area this year with Python

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,760
so that's that's really good and that's

00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,610
why we've organized the full-day PD but

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,250
trying to improve their ICT capabilities

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,240
it is a massive challenge and we

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:09,750
constantly provide opportunities every

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,159
term the school provides opportunities

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,070
yeah I just don't know how far we're

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,320
going along with that though I think

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,539
you're facing that challenge along with

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,850
every other school in Australia so if

00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,809
you feel like you're in good company any

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:27,820
other questions

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:31,140
all right well I will continue to ask

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,690
you questions at lunch but I think let's

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,460
finish up there thank you very much John

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:41,340
thank you

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,810
I get to mug you again hooray

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,630
congratulations genuine bona fide

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,630
