	00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,109
speaking of making yourself feel dumb

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,740
and stretching your boundaries we have

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,280
lightning talks now where is our

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,920
lightning talks are there is yes

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,680
let's introduce and make feel welcome

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,869
Christopher Neugebauer

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,070
thank you just it is on let's see I had

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,349
some cards here

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,910
Beck's done if you can get on stage and

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,140
plug your laptop in so that you can give

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:46,440
your talk

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:54,809
where is Becks hi okay lightning talks

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:55,320
we know how this works yeah okay how do

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,239
they work

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,399
okay lightning talks they are five

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,800
minute talks up pick up pick aside and

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,150
plug in and our AV person will Mack you

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,820
up so their five minute talks on a topic

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,229
of the presenters choice they get five

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,000
minutes they get no more than five

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,299
minutes and it is your job as the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,960
audience to enforce the five-minute time

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,810
limit we do this by starting a very

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,210
quiet rolling applause sometime in the

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,340
last five or so seconds of the talk you

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,310
can do this like this and if enough of

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,759
you do this you can actually hear it

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,229
okay and and then we applause once the

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,420
time when it goes off so that you can't

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:41,210
actually hear the person on stage so

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,229
yeah aboard great great great stop

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,720
you've actually got good at it over the

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,450
last few years I'm I'm glad last like

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,100
the first few times I tried that they'd

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,270
be applauding for the four five minutes

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,649
at the start of the lightning talks and

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,010
was very very embarrassing for all

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,280
concerned we have 12 lightning talks

00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,600
[Music]

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,579
Tim answers going to be on this one on

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,119
this side so if I guess he can start

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,119
setting up

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,470
are we ready over on this side almost we

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,440
this is this is awkward normally there's

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,030
some time to setup and instead I get to

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:28,810
stand on stage looking awkward for the

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:33,250
first few minutes this is - oh okay I

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,530
think I think we're ready to go so our

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,080
first presenter is Bex Dunn who is a

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,849
landscape scientist at Geoscience

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,860
Australia she's going to be talking

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,350
about using satellite data to look

00:02:41,860 --> 00:03:02,819
through space and time and hopefully

00:02:44,350 --> 00:03:02,819
find useful stuff with Python thank you

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:14,410
that's the last one

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:16,959
hello g'day as other people have said

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,390
there are a lot of you which is a little

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,390
bit surprising this is my first Pike on

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,709
this is my first lightning talk

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,170
probably planning goes with the

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:39,160
territory I am a landscape scientist at

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,350
Geoscience Australia and thought I'd

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,600
show you a very very quick look at some

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:48,640
of the things that I do in my day to day

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:52,570
job with Python so with the wonderful

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,250
help with windows snipping tool the

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,050
program I work for is digital earth

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,290
Australia which is part of Geoscience

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:02,980
Australia so we have the archive of

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:06,400
Australia's Open satellite data so space

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:10,150
and time 30 years deep and goes out to

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,220
various bits in the ocean as well and we

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,010
try and do awesome things with it for

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,450
the public and for other people who

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:27,760
might use it in the government as well

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:30,180
so this is an actual thing it was not

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,910
created using machine learning algorithm

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,560
I would like to use some machine

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,300
learning algorithms on it but this is a

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,210
mathematically transformed piece of part

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,000
of the Cooper Basin in Western Australia

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,790
and has some bright pink salty things

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,820
and some blue wet things and some pale

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,380
blue sometimes wet things and some

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,880
yellow things that are sometimes green

00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,160
so what it actually is is it's a

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,650
compilation through space and time of

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,160
the behavior of part of our landscape in

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,600
Australia one thing that I am constantly

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,060
reminded of is the fact that Australia

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,070
is incredibly stunningly beautiful and

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,620
I'm really lucky to be able to look at

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,490
it from space all the time sorry that's

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,490
probably way too close

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,910
but looking at things all squished

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,470
together can be really complicated so

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,650
one of the other things we do is try and

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,690
break things down and display them so

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,740
I'm also really lucky in that I work

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,020
with a whole bunch of really really

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,250
talented developers and scientists so

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,780
one of my colleagues showed me how to

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,090
make animations recently so we use x-ray

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,180
we

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,770
pandas we use matplotlib this is using

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,550
all of those things and it's looking at

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,870
environmental water flowing into an area

00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:00,610
of the Macquarie marshes in the Murray

00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,610
Darling Basin and it's looking at how

00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,419
the water that we use in the Murray

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,090
Darling based and how it contributes

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,310
back to the landscape as well so I'm not

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,310
sure how well you can see it I stole it

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,820
from another slide which was mine but

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,320
the green stuff is growing parts and

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:26,180
trees the dark stuff is water and the

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:34,060
graph which is taken from some stream

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:37,220
gauges is the water going in as well so

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,650
all our code is open and we encourage

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,479
you to go and play with it use it tell

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:46,220
us what's wrong with it

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:48,440
our API is Python it's called digital

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,729
earth Australia and we have a read the

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,800
docs as well

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:55,400
which is the second link if I'm not

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,130
terrible at copying and pasting the top

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,020
link is da notebooks which you can also

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:06,230
contribute to it as well

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:11,360
sorry um thank you thank you very much

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:14,570
it is uh it's it's really wonderful to

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,190
see open source from from government

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,370
being done well so thank you very much

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,810
for that talk so one of the things we've

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,580
done differently with lightning talks at

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,470
PyCon I use this year is rather than

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,850
having you know writing your name on a

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,520
board that everyone can see and there's

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,250
only 12 cards we've taken a box of them

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,400
and well we've actually got two boxes

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,870
one for people who've given talks at

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,430
PyCon a your other conferences before

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,390
and new presenters and we've got a

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,650
really good collection of of new new

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,450
presenters presenting lightning talk

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,260
sender and ex was the the first of those

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,810
today on deck we have another new

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:56,510
presenter Daniel der Aras so if you can

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,950
come in and and get set up while is this

00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,750
one of your open source projects that

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:12,740
you want people to commit to contribute

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:19,060
to Tim where's Daniel Doris hi for those

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,060
who don't know me my slides should work

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:32,510
there we go I'm Tim and I have a secret

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,870
some people might know me as a bit of a

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,560
robot but I'm not actually a robot I'm a

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,330
human I'm all human inside and like all

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:47,720
humans I suck

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:52,670
I am a constant bug generator I write

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,160
code like this and it ends up with all

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,050
the bugs in it

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,320
the thing I like about software though

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,000
is you can patch it you can fix the bugs

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,130
after you've written them and I write

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,420
lots of bugs so I end up fixing lots of

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:11,240
bugs this is hardware I don't like

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,670
hardware very much because it's quite

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,210
hard to patch after you've put bugs in

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:22,010
them then I discovered this thing called

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:26,810
an FPGA and FPGA makes hardware into

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,820
software and so it was love because I

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,060
can fix all my problems after a foray

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,750
shipped my hardware but there was a bit

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,600
of a trouble in paradise FPGA is are

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,890
programmed in two primary languages and

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,080
you might notice neither of these are

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,970
private do you mind if I interrupt as

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,650
quickly we don't seem to have our next

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,040
presenter can Mary McLeod come and set

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:51,980
up please thank you and so this makes me

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,110
sad and then I discovered this thing

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:59,030
could median me sock and like X and

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,550
discovered that I could program an FPGA

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,740
using this stuff you might notice it's

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:08,000
Python based so that was awesome

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,530
and the reason this is awesome it's

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,380
because pythons are powerful and

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:15,470
productive language and allows me to

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,520
generate exactly the hardware that I

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:22,490
need in my FPGA design the thing is

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,080
though writing hardware is still hard

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,380
and so I try and do as little of it as I

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,800
can

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:34,520
the other great thing about this media

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:38,810
and meshach approach is they embed a cpu

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,030
into your FPGA and so you can write less

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,520
Hardware because most of the stuff you

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,990
write software and as we know I can

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,300
write lots of bugs and software and then

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:51,980
fix the metal later date or hopefully

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:54,110
get you to fix them for me and so you

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,120
write software on a soft CPU because

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,000
writing hard was hard and so let's do

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,050
less of it

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,970
soft CPU the problem is that you

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:08,830
currently don't use Python for this and

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,830
that makes me sad as well

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:16,910
this is to remind me to breathe

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:19,640
occasionally not Python but it turns out

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,750
somebody in this conference is really

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:27,350
awesome and design something could micro

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:30,440
Python so we should run micro Python on

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,260
the soft CPU and so that's what the Fupa

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,540
project is it takes a Python description

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,810
of hardware and runs micro Python on it

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,680
to get you FPGAs and so you've got

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:45,920
Python with Python running on a bunch of

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,250
hardware and I would love help to make

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,500
this work we have a bunch of hardware

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,250
here and I will give you hardware if you

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,529
come and contribute to the project so

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,399
this is pretty awesome and you should

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:05,649
come along and have nirvana with me with

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:11,540
lots of Python lots and lots of Python

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:12,900
so I come and be super you with me and

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,250
get me a built-in hardware

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,250
[Music]

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,529
that was not your usual talk to him

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:29,350
51 flights in four minutes

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:34,339
congratulations so let's try again is

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:36,519
Daniel here at all okay looks like he's

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,930
not going to be presenting we had a

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,519
Katrina McDonald you can come and set up

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,079
instead that would be amazing

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,490
we had a a threat to our lightning talk

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,809
presenters that if they didn't show up

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,319
one of the organizers would do

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:53,839
interpretive dance in their place and

00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:55,459
that didn't work in the in the direction

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,170
that I was hoping it seems to be an

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:03,860
incentive to not present anyway we now

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:08,889
have Marin McLeod who is going to talk

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,889
about the flip-flop operator in Ruby

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:23,600
hello oh yes

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:27,470
so five hours ago I did not know what

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,300
this was and Tom sent me as the the

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,520
resident rubyist at this conference a

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,950
message asking if I knew what it was I

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,340
said no he suggested I do a lightning

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,170
talk on it and so true to his suggestion

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,780
that teaching is one of the best ways of

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,610
learning I've spent the last five hours

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,750
learning what this is and now I'm gonna

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:50,330
tell you all so what I'm going to do

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,530
over the next five minutes is I'm gonna

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,500
tell you why I'm giving this talk

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,310
because Tom told me to I'm gonna tell

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,910
you who I am

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm Marin hello I'm gonna tell you what

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,700
it is

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,890
I'm gonna tell you where it's from how

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:08,510
it's used and the future of the

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:10,640
flip-flopper Reiter what is the

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:16,070
flip-flopper Reiter no one uses the term

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:20,150
I'm coining it so basically the

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:24,110
flip-flopper ATAR is two dots it goes in

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:26,180
between two statements a and B the blue

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,600
and yellow zones that I put here it

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,930
returns false until a is true once it's

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,060
been true it returns true until B is

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,200
true and then once B has been true it

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,430
returns false

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:46,540
so it's flipping and flopping

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:52,180
a little bit so for example here here's

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:54,339
some Ruby don't cry or anything so we're

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,230
going those two dots are different those

00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:04,510
two dots at the beginning a different

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:09,190
dot that's a range so in an array

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:11,920
between 1 & 5 we're selecting just

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:15,130
between two and four with the flip

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,570
flopper ater it it was a little bit

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:21,160
difficult for me to think of something

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:24,520
that was relevant to you or useful in

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,510
any way I couldn't really find any

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:32,620
examples online so I just wanted to put

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,860
this cat this is Monsur Bobo he's a

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,110
really good cat but sometimes people

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,630
write you know extended screens about

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,240
how great he is and use different

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,150
nicknames for him like once you're very

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:50,440
good cat Bobo or Monsur lipatti

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:53,050
cha Bobo or whatever and so I've written

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:59,380
a Bobo nickname front finder using the

00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:02,350
flip flop errata so it starts with the

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,690
word Monsour and you know flips on when

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,570
the word monster is reached and it flips

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:11,770
off when the word Bobo is reached and it

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:14,800
it puts it in from there so you can see

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,720
that in the Bobo nickname finder with us

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,990
a sentence reading I've had a great day

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,270
with this large boy Monsur Bobo you may

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,560
also know him as Morse your chunky Bobo

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,380
or Monsur loves to eat the food Bobo

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,050
we've got once your Bobo once your

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,560
chunky Bobo and once he loves to eat the

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,300
food Bobo

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,220
so that's a my very relevant and useful

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,970
you said this

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,170
so that's what it is so the next next

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,940
part where is it from

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:51,740
it's from Pearl this is the Pearl

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,810
documentation there wasn't there's not

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,380
actually any Ruby documentation for this

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,660
there's a some people think that maybe

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:05,930
it wasn't intentionally included in Ruby

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:07,850
at all so so pearl got it from said and

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,940
orc this is the said and orc

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,440
documentation it's a common thing it

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,880
seems like a normal thing that people

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,500
actually use in there and it's not

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,180
called a flip-flopper Reiter although it

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
should be many and they got it from

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:29,990
electronics does anyone here understand

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:32,830
this diagram good on you you can now

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,110
call this a flip-flopper Reiter and

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,680
electronics as well so that's where it's

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:46,150
from how is it used so that someone did

00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:50,020
a survey of ruby it's not used and

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:53,650
nobody likes it it's rude

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,650
what's its future

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,290
it's that's all yeah

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:26,760
do you feel enlightened okay so if Adam

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,559
jockey apa' comes and sets up over here

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,960
that would be great but first we have

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,559
Katrina McDonald who's going to tell us

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:42,179
about

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:44,070
Digitek and Python in the classroom so I

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,809
inspired to give this talk following the

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,460
student showcase yesterday in the

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,679
education seminar and how wonderful it

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,750
was to see a lot of people coming in to

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,250
watch the amazing work that the students

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,500
presented if you missed it you should

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,590
definitely follow up on that and then

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,260
secondly because of the discussion that

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,090
happened during the keynote about

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,500
stereotypes of what people are able to

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,660
do based on what country they were born

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,600
in with their technology

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,900
so I teach digital technology down in

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,550
Victoria I do that because I was a math

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,500
teacher whose husband comes along to

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,510
PyCon and therefore I am clearly

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,340
qualified to be instructing children in

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,290
how to use Python and programming as

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,510
long as I stay a step ahead of them in

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:31,020
grok we're good and really what I wanted

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:34,770
to present today was my experiences in a

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,220
slightly below average social economic

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,770
status school where to get silence in

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,420
the classroom this happens for me when a

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,860
pigeon flies into the room and there's a

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,540
raucous amount of noise and then the

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,530
class is silent because they will run

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:51,210
and it happens when you turn around -

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,559
right we will learn on the board and

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,900
there was a raucous amount of noise and

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,100
silence because there's been a punch up

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,990
and they really want to know how you

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,550
react to a punch up in the middle of

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,860
math class

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:05,610
so yeah I don't get a lot of silence in

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,559
my room there is a lot of learning

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,940
hopefully happening in that noise but I

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,480
wanted to let you know about some of the

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,360
assumptions that you shouldn't make

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,530
about students who are learning coding

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,580
now and who form potentially your users

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,190
because they are all there on their

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,600
laptops and phones but that doesn't mean

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,420
that you should assume that they know

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,200
that hands go

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,670
you perpendicular to a keyboard not

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,910
parallel with the monitor or a weird

00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:36,870
like 90 degree not 90 degree reflex

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,120
angles sort of thing as they type and

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:43,270
don't make the assumption that they

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:46,600
understand what level of programming

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,190
skill they have or that you have I often

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,540
have your nines come up to me who I like

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,160
miss you need to help me with this

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,360
problem this function is not working and

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,220
that dictionary doesn't happen I don't

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,730
understand why this happens Andrew and

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,410
I'm like cool cool

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:04,390
you know dictionaries you're doing

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:06,460
really well this is good and it doesn't

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,600
matter how many times I explain to these

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:14,260
kids I am maybe a good math teacher not

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,360
very capable in the IT area they can't

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,000
see that it's not always a transferable

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,340
skill and then at the same end of the

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,860
spectrum you have the kids who think

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,770
that I'm an absolute IT ninja because

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,610
when they have a tab open struggling to

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,960
drive here if I say close the tab

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,890
because I can see the game on the laptop

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,230
and they go quick I understand that

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,660
that's not closed and the kids think

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:45,640
that I'm a ninja with that they are

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:48,510
thing in some of my classes that clearly

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,310
because I can run a search from here in

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,260
the address bar therefore whenever I

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,360
give them a URL it just immediately goes

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,000
here and that is how you get to a

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,530
webpage there is no need to use this

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,910
section of your computer or your monitor

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,020
there have been cases where despite

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,880
finishing the grah course

00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,710
so clearly they'd the ACA pay chatbot

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,200
thing where they learn to do four

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,530
statements we gave them a micro bit and

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,440
they came and presented to me 200 lines

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,930
of if statement then do this if then do

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,160
that to make a little memory game so

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,480
don't assume that they actually learnt

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,460
that fourth statement and then

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,220
definitely don't assume that they

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,560
checked the sorry they checked the if

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,660
statement before they copied it 200

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,420
times

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,870
and when you politely break it to them

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,180
that hey we need to fix the indentation

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,400
error there 200 times but maybe we could

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,280
go look at this crazy idea of using a

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,690
loop don't assume that they take that on

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,970
is that we should go learn to do loops

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,900
not I'm going to fix that indentation

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:58,130
err 200 times and then the final thing

00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,360
that I've learnt programming in or

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,740
working with kids programming is that

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,540
just because there's a raucous amount of

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,460
noise in your classroom followed by

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:14,700
silence just occasionally it's because

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:16,840
there's been some progress made and that

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:24,700
was our treatment last week thank you

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:28,300
[Applause]

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:32,380
I've never never felt more excited about

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:35,710
the future of garbage day I I want one

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,690
of those for my bin is Claire Carson

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,060
here

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:43,870
great you're up next but first we have

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,570
Adam with Django rest and pusher

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:51,280
open-source software library OSS library

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:53,460
yes great hi everyone this is my first

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,320
talk ever

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,630
going to pour too much you've only got

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,560
five minutes I put these slides together

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,370
very quickly to show off this library so

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,990
so what is dara pusher it's an opinion

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,720
opinionated library that aims to add

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,030
real-time push a functionality the rest

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,820
framework with minimal configuration and

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,740
setup so I've leveraged a few existing

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,380
patterns within Django and rest

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,810
framework so using signals and receivers

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,380
to connect your views to a sending

00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:28,690
function and using rest framework

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,230
serializers to serialize your models for

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:35,710
pusher and on the other on the other

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,930
side we have push up using WebSockets to

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,340
send out these updates and I'm not

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,950
affiliated with pusher in any way but

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,420
that's what I use at work and when

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,670
you're using pusher you basically have

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,930
an event name a number of channels and

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,120
the data that you want to send so in the

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,070
library it's quite easy to set up you

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,420
know put DRF model pusher into your

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,030
installed apps and configure your

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,830
credentials you will register your

00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,700
models through the serializers with a

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,820
pusher back-end class and you add a mix

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,860
into your views you define a get push a

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,260
channels method which returns a list of

00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,060
strings and then you can just kind of

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,900
create update and delete your models

00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,820
through the view and see it update so

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,550
when you're actually implementing the

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,350
push a back-end you'll define a simple

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,240
model a serializer it can be as

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,710
complicated as you want and you tie

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,360
these these together with the pusher

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,580
back-end so you just define the

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,270
serializer class and it's just about

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,840
ready to go in the background it's using

00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,900
some

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,850
classing to register all these

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,520
serializers and models so you don't need

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,150
a kind of configure too much elsewhere

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,610
and on the views you will add the model

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,640
push of you mix in and define your get

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:56,380
pushed channels method and hopefully

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,180
that should be it so it's still fairly

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,550
young project but it doesn't include

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,070
supporting public and private pusher

00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,190
channels you can extend the pusher back

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,720
in class if you have any specific needs

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,240
you can ignore the current connection

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,130
and if you need that and the way it

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,600
works at least in my company is that

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,960
sent through a background worker

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,120
so that's supported and I think this

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,100
could support a lot of other use cases

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,290
as well but the main thing was that it

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,530
can be integrated quickly I know someone

00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:29,470
who's implemented this and with about an

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,380
hour which i think is pretty good so

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,150
there's a few limitations one is that

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,580
with pusher you have a default 10

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,200
kilobyte message size limit but

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,980
real-time updates should be quite small

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,750
and of course it only works with pusher

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,690
which a bit of a problem where I see it

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:49,050
so I think how this could be a bit more

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,250
useful to developers is potentially

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:54,010
generalizing this design pattern away

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,870
from just push just push er to other

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,970
services like a Blee

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,790
maybe Jango channels if that's possible

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,010
since it uses WebSockets and any other

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,980
recommendations about how it could kind

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,530
of extend it would be good and and other

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,260
uses for model pusher so if there is a

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,150
message size limit perhaps we could send

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,340
out kind of cache invalidation requests

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,970
through pusher and you can request those

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,040
objects instead that's it

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,050
special thank you to Matthew Egan for

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,670
contributing crowd comes and galibi

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,940
which is where I work and PyCon for

00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,940
having me

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:36,870
thank you that was great I got my my one

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,610
lightning talk with metaclasses I was

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,650
betting on I'm getting at least one so

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:45,990
that's great on this side we have

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,750
Felicity Robson are you here great so

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,980
you're up next but first we have Claire

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:55,799
Krause who's going to tell us about

00:27:49,980 --> 00:28:01,289
watching water from space thank you very

00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:02,429
much hi everybody my name is Claire

00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:04,650
Krause and I work at Geoscience

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,150
Australia Bex tonight at lunchtime

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,620
decided it would be fun to do lightning

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,970
talks even though he had absolutely no

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:15,150
idea what they are cuz they both had our

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:16,710
first icon so I'm a scientist I'm not a

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,580
software developer so I have a

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,909
background in climatology I did a PhD in

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,340
paleoclimatology which is

00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,630
reconstructions of past climate and you

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,220
know all of that I did some climate

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,260
modeling and discovered that software

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,360
and coding is really what I enjoy not

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,890
lab work I hate hated sitting there

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,570
taking tiny little measurements of

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,750
powder that if you sneezed it was all

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,520
over so I moved into coding because I

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,260
really enjoyed it and now I'm at

00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,510
Geoscience Australia and it's scientist

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,370
and I'm working with satellite imagery I

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,620
work in the same program as Beck's in

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:50,250
digital earth Australia and my job is to

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,870
look at agriculture from space so we had

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,340
a problem one of our government

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,520
stakeholders came to us and said we

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,429
really want some help we want to know in

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,320
Australia when farm storage dams are

00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:03,600
being filled and emptied so this is a

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,880
really contentious issue because of

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,380
water use particularly in areas of

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,020
Australia whether it is that may be as

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,340
much water as people want there to be

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,840
and so we wanted to keep they wanted to

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,400
keep track of when dams are being

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,510
emptied and filled so that they can make

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,940
sure that everybody's doing the right

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,789
thing so this is what we started with

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,530
and if you look in this picture maybe

00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:24,809
you can spot some dams if you really

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,159
sort of squint but the data said that

00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:27,570
they had been using previously was

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,830
something that had been digitized so

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,720
someone has sat there for all of

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,100
Australia or all of their part of

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,429
Australia that they're interested in and

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,169
clicked and made a thing of dams the

00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:39,150
great thing about that is that at least

00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,440
they know that you know as far as that

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,280
person is trained that it's a really

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,320
good set data

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,510
but it means that all the small dams

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,670
they didn't quite get and then six

00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,990
months later even you know two months

00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,520
later if someone builds a new dam it's

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,100
out of date so we wanted to automate

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,820
this so maybe by now you've kind of

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,470
found some dams in that particular time

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,300
this is what it actually is so if you

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,910
can see those tiny little blue things

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,950
that came up so if I can can you see

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,440
just a couple of really small blue ones

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,410
come up so they're the dams that we were

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,720
able to spot from space so we have an

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,490
algorithm that detects water and what we

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,930
did was we used our what our detecting

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,330
algorithm to find where all these stands

00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,160
are and as I said I'm not a software

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,260
developer so every time I something

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,170
really good happens I sort of stand up

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,360
at my desk and go and still everybody

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,280
gathers around me and then I can tell

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,660
them what I've done so at this point I

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,280
went look at that and I found dams but

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,750
at this point it was a raster data set

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,980
which means those they're pixels and we

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,980
didn't want that because the people that

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,750
we do is uses you as use ArcGIS which

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,260
means they want to shape files so then I

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:50,190
did a lot of code munching to get some

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:51,210
some a polygon data set and the this is

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,440
what that looks for so this is the

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,790
murray-darling basin and this is a

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,260
polygon data set of every water body in

00:30:55,790 --> 00:31:00,030
2013 and this is an automatic process

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,460
start with satellite imagery which means

00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:04,080
that any time there's a new satellite

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,730
imagery which in Australia is every 16

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,900
days although we're moving to five days

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,120
because we've got some new satellites

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,440
that the Europeans put up we can rerun

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,970
this algorithm so now we have a really

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,520
good handle on where the water bodies

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,920
are in Australia what we can then do is

00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,210
look at how they're behaving so this is

00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,040
one of the dams that we were able to

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,800
automatically detect and what you might

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,840
be able to see is no water at the start

00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,760
and then it starts doing this and that

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,830
gives us a really good indication that

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,630
that's when the dam was built so if you

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,690
zoom in what you can see is this

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,520
particular dam is is full the person is

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,930
draining it and then they're filling it

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,090
again and so what we're going to be

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,100
doing is building a flagging system so

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,390
that anytime it goes up we can say hey

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,320
were they allowed to do that at that

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:47,760
time and someone can take a better look

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,080
so what you can see when you do that

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,510
through all of time because you have

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,090
data back to 1987 as you can see when

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,940
the dams were built

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,440
you can see tailings down so this is the

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,620
particular years that these downs were

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,570
built in relation to a mine and this was

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,310
a polygon that wasn't quite right but

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,780
even though it wasn't quite right so it

00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,730
gives us really useful information so

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,860
this tells us anytime this particular

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,940
part of the floodplain was inundated so

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:16,940
we still get some really useful

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:18,980
information so my job now is is to

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,930
improve this and make it better and then

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,910
pass it on to our stakeholders who deal

00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:26,750
with the sort of implications of all of

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,610
this but yes my job is to manage code

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,820
until I get cool results and then deaths

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:38,630
thank you

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:38,630
[Applause]

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:47,410
yet good

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:49,929
I was handwriting has improved so much

00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:54,190
since last year nickmoore you're up on

00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:55,960
this side but first

00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:06,520
Felicity Robson who's going to tell us

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:08,980
about cracking captures so hi everyone

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,690
I'm Felicity Robson I'm a student

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:25,059
au 12 student at Gunn garland College

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:26,380
and this is my first PyCon so I want you

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,350
all to think about how much information

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,690
you take in on a daily basis the sounds

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,540
you hear the sights you see the way you

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,490
interpret all this and all your emotions

00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:39,070
that's a lot of information for you to

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:42,429
be to be able to draw on and you've been

00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,740
doing that ever since birth now think

00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:46,630
about the life of a program it only has

00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,960
the information that you give to it and

00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,610
it can only can learn if you teach it so

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,550
take this picture for example which you

00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:57,880
saw before now what is this a picture of

00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,010
thank you

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,170
yeah how do you know that you know that

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,690
because well somebody has sets you

00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:07,570
previously nothing there with full legs

00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:11,530
and triangle is that's a cat so you know

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:14,200
that so this is my cat Phoenix and what

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:17,109
if I show you this picture this is

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,590
Phoenix too you knew that because I just

00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,210
told you I told you that the previous

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,919
image was Phoenix and you are able to

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,080
apply that information to a whole

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,399
different situation I mean it's not

00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,399
entirely different in this one but

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:38,579
if

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,539
if we didn't give a computer information

00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,220
and we told it to find Phoenix in this

00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,950
image you'd be like I have no idea what

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,659
a Phoenix is what are you talking about

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,279
so suddenly you go back to this image

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,079
and you're like okay that that is

00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:02,180
Phoenix right in the middle and it can

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
identify some key points from that so

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,470
like he's black and white house triangle

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,779
is and full X so then you show in this

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:11,599
picture and then it's like oh that right

00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:15,380
there that's Phoenix thus identifying

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,259
the key points of Phoenix and applying

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,239
it to a whole different situation so me

00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:30,769
and my friend Trisha who refused to get

00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:35,299
up here with me so what we've been

00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:37,400
working on is started create an

00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,410
implementation of the sift algorithm

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,109
which is used to break through every

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:44,509
CAPTCHA on a website do you know how

00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,819
hard it is to create a robot to be a

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:51,259
program that is made to keep out robots

00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:52,940
it is ridiculously hard okay so that's

00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:54,890
not what encouraged us to start this

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,319
program you know we're like you know

00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,779
what you're telling us that we need to

00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,789
be human to get into this website this

00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:03,119
is robot discrimination we're gonna fix

00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,710
this

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,710
so we got to work creating a captcha

00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,970
cracker we decide to do that trying to

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,220
break through all the recaptures would

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,780
be insanely difficult so we found the

00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,869
most common ones which is vehicles

00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:20,230
storefronts and street size so the

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:22,570
vehicles is way too varied like you've

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,190
got cars motorbikes trucks and whatever

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,700
that blue thing is up there like I don't

00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,230
even know why Thanks and then the

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,869
storefronts I thought thought might be

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,130
promising but I can't actually tell

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:37,990
which one of those is a storefront sir

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,839
how am I supposed to teach a computer

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:46,119
what is still front if it is if I don't

00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:49,000
even know so we agreed that Street

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,349
science would be the best one because we

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,820
considered we thought that that would be

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:58,079
pretty universal right like similar

00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:58,079
shapes similar sizes and colors well

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,730
yeah that didn't turn out too well we

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,940
found this out way too late so it was

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:09,190
sort of stuck doing this now so this is

00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,200
what we wanted it to do we wanted to

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,369
find the recapture the street time

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,839
within the recapture then find the

00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:19,810
recapture within the screenshot and then

00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:21,250
therefore find the street sign within

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:25,329
the screenshot so I can choose which

00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:26,680
points it is so of course no program

00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:29,980
goes without hours and hours of

00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,170
debugging right so the biggest problem

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,940
that we came across was recapture will

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,099
very helpfully decide that we acted too

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:41,920
robotic and would kick us out for hours

00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:44,800
at a time so we figured out that if we

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,200
filled it in ourselves it will make a it

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,930
wouldn't lock us out most of the time

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:55,000
this picture was taken earlier today now

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,200
another one problem that we had so if we

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,900
go back to this one this is what we

00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,490
wanted to do right and this is what it

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,230
actually does at the moment

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,210
so that's what we're currently trying to

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:07,569
do to fix it up now if you want to see

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,339
how what we've been working on we've

00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:11,589
made an online journal of everything

00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:13,710
that we've done so go have a look at

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,710
that

00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:23,720
thank you very much

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:25,530
[Applause]

00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,910
okay

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:32,460
Benna rice is on deck Nick Moore is

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:38,100
going to be talking to us about brain

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:39,960
science so rocket surgery is come up

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:47,040
hi everyone I'm Nick ward this is not my

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:48,450
first Pike on this is the story of a

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,390
little project we did for a conference

00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,010
called buzz conf Andrew Fisher and ego

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,970
me and myself were talking about what

00:38:53,010 --> 00:39:00,090
fun things we could do with an outdoors

00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:02,580
tech conference and thanks to Ben and

00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,780
Rick who were running buzz conf they

00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,510
gave us permission to do something a

00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,640
little bit silly we were talking we said

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,800
why don't we do some rocketry rocketry

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,660
is fun everyone likes rocketry things

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,670
exploding that's the only band to go

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,830
down well it's got lots of interesting

00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,690
physics you know momentum and an

00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:20,070
acceleration and things like that

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,540
there's lots to talk about there's lots

00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,480
of interesting things for people to

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,740
learn and stuff like that

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,980
rocketry however is normally a fairly

00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:32,580
expensive affair it's very large it's

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,840
very hot it tends to explode things like

00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,190
that we were pretty sure we couldn't get

00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,550
away with doing that in a paddock in

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,750
Berlin thankfully it's gotten a lot

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,590
cheaper to do this sort of stuff

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,420
recently a really interesting technical

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,460
thing happened that was just this new

00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:51,740
science fictional concept when I started

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,970
uni called MEMS which is this idea of 3d

00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,430
lithography for chips where you actually

00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,020
carve 3d structures into a chip and use

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,420
them to make a tiny little mechanical

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,250
device within a silicon wafer a cell

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,900
rama's gyrometer z' barometers things

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,930
like that that's actually a photo a

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,850
micro photograph of one of that to 72.7

00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,680
millimeters across that dye and you can

00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,480
see there's little tiny physical moving

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,670
parts inside that die which is just

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,800
amazing those chips are now of course

00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,570
used in every mobile phone and every

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,940
controller and everything like that

00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,820
they're amazingly common and they're

00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,560
suddenly incredibly cheap the other

00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,080
thing that was incredibly cheap was the

00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,730
ESP 32 processor that we used from

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,540
espressos of one of our sponsors this

00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:34,860
weekend which is a 32-bit CPU with Wi-Fi

00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,260
on board amazing

00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:40,800
ship and you can get them for about five

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,350
bucks so now we had a rocket telemetry

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,330
system that we could put together for 20

00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:49,950
bucks total cost so we could make

00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:51,450
several of them which was good because

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,190
they were strapped to lithium batteries

00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,230
and fired off the end of a high-pressure

00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,760
jet of water and there's two things

00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:01,170
lithium batteries don't like one is

00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:05,430
impact one is water so we expected to

00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:07,230
lose a few units that's just the SPF 30

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,610
new features this was originally a ten

00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,480
minute presentation but I'm just talking

00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,930
to us as fast so this is a prototype

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,060
it's a SP 32 development board taped to

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,310
a battery stuck inside a tennis ball

00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:25,680
which I then threw across an oval with

00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:27,120
one of those dog things yes and it turns

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,310
out that just tumbled uselessly so I

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,900
taped some cardboard fins to it got

00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:34,680
nasa/jpl to help me out with them

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,300
obviously that's the next prototype

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,890
which looks a bit like a hamburger if

00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,990
you're hungry

00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,520
that's the much better prototype that we

00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,220
put in the 10 Rockets we put together

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,770
for buzz conf wrapped in bubble wrap and

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,570
so on and that's that little purple

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,550
board is the seller Amador and gyrometer

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:54,180
and so on and so forth sold it on to the

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:56,040
CPU board that CPU is capable of running

00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,920
micro Python so we've got to buy a bunch

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,680
of software in Python to actually do the

00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,960
the telemetry that then sent back

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,370
signals

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,870
that's the i2c bus reading the

00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,690
accelerometer we're doing this in

00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:11,430
fast-forward talking to MQTT and then a

00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:15,810
bunch of stuff took that in PTT and gave

00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:18,690
us live telemetry from the Rockets that

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,100
didn't work very well that's a graph

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,210
obviously it's very clear what that's a

00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:27,720
graph of sure a lot of numbers but

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:29,760
that's that's a that whoohoo feeling if

00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,400
something actually worked I blinked an

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,500
LED in this case I received a packet

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,660
it's an amazing thing it's what keeps me

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,430
doing software

00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,530
it's nice when it actually works that's

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,630
the thing that worked a bit better

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:45,210
that's a thing that explains that a bit

00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,370
more right Rockets so this is actually

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,890
as firing rockets off at a buzz conf you

00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:53,100
can see rocket ascending you can see

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:54,450
Andy getting soaking wet we discovered

00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,730
that the rocket launch show that we

00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,560
designed back in dry Melbourne was not

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,050
very good on completely saturated ground

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,250
and it kept falling over and pointing at

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:08,250
attendees so we decided and he was

00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:11,130
sacrificed for the greater good he was

00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,800
expendable so there is there he is again

00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:17,130
showing his use of safety gear that's

00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,420
the cup of coffee and you can see some

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,940
really interesting things from this this

00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,400
I by the way took like 400 photos to get

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,110
this photo you can see the little ring

00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,050
of water flying out you can see the

00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:29,760
thing it's amazing that I've got some

00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,770
close-ups of the actual plume of exhaust

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,510
you can see there's the the stream water

00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,640
coming out and the actual sort of steam

00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,130
coming off it

00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,440
we actually got a successful graph thank

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:43,579
you very much

00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,579
[Music]

00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,079
somewhere out there somewhere out there

00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:50,969
Elon Musk has been watching this

00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:56,449
deciding to go into the tennis ball

00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:59,670
manufacture industry so sorry about that

00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:08,609
on this side we have pedal of it

00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:10,469
but first so this too is not my first

00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:13,289
pike on it's also not the first time I

00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:17,579
presented this but I have updated it so

00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:19,109
picture if you will a bunch of Internet

00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,329
libertarians walk into a venture

00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:22,679
capitalists office and I don't have my

00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:27,359
presenter notes where are my presenter

00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:28,769
notes there they are right so and the

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,499
venture capitalist says what's your

00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:32,789
pitch so miners collect transactions in

00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:34,829
two blocks they get to choose what

00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:40,469
transactions they take so we let them

00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:41,219
charge fees the miners then Jesus I'm

00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,079
not doing very well

00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:44,549
the miners then throw as much brute

00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,509
force computing power as they can to

00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,640
take the prize in this blocks

00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:49,650
cryptographic lottery the miner goes

00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,119
looking for a nonce they take their

00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,890
block of transactions along with the

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,449
hash of the last known block and they

00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,069
add a random nonce and they calculate

00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:58,410
the hash of the resounding resulting

00:44:56,069 --> 00:45:01,079
block they do this over and over and

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,279
over again if the numerical value of

00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,679
that hash is lower than some threshold

00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:06,179
and they win they've mined a block they

00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,099
get all the fees for that transaction

00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,719
along with the bunch of shiny new coins

00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,329
for their cells if they fail they just

00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:13,679
try again it's really hard to pick what

00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,789
Dad is going to have a particular hash

00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,579
so guessing the right value for the

00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:19,529
nonce takes a ton of calculations

00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:20,459
something like nearly 50 quintillion

00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:22,199
hashes per second

00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:24,150
a new block is mined on average about

00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:25,469
every nine or so minutes which means

00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,859
that each block requires something like

00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:30,809
28 60 lien sextillion hashes to be

00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,189
calculated and we just make this number

00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:33,359
bigger by adjusting the threshold every

00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:34,829
couple of weeks so it sticks around the

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,289
one block every 10-minute mark even as

00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:38,670
computers gets faster we throw all these

00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:39,689
calculations away though because the

00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,949
actual point is just to show that you're

00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:42,050
willing to waste electricity faster than

00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:45,149
anyone else

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:45,149
[Music]

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,070
but now we have a decentralized currency

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,830
nobody controls it we can say goodbye to

00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:55,390
all that worthless fiat currency no more

00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,980
with the civil of central authority tell

00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,540
us what to do we can be free of all

00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,160
those incredible government things like

00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,400
taxes and fraud regulations and

00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:23,930
cryptography means it's secure right

00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:23,930
[Laughter]

00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,110
it's not just about currency though we

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:32,560
can use this for all kinds of things

00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:34,300
just think we could put contracts on the

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,620
blockchain we could put it on there too

00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,330
instead of currency we can stick

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,520
contract on there and contracts that are

00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:43,750
written in code because codes always

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,730
correct and it gets around all of those

00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,410
really complicated and tricky human

00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:56,080
problems that we can easily solve with

00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:57,310
Matz yeah and because maths is provable

00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,960
and everything's immutable there's no

00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:02,040
way in hell everyone's just going to

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,040
scan the hell out of you

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:13,759
so the VC looks at them and says this is

00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:16,609
the stupidest idea I've ever heard what

00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:25,329
do you call this crap and the VC's reply

00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:25,329
is everybody ready thank you very much

00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:42,440
thank you for that and yo-yo you're very

00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:47,720
welcome bento so I felt James is up on

00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:49,579
this side so if I just block out half of

00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,289
this card I'm gonna read off the title

00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:59,420
that I can see here from Peter loved it

00:47:51,289 --> 00:48:03,140
it just says no I have to accept it with

00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:07,160
me everybody thank you which should

00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:08,359
actually be no I'm paid to love it for

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,079
those that don't know me this is my

00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:16,309
first flattening talk so this is my

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:19,759
first lightening talk today I've been to

00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:22,690
all of the play cons I teach this I take

00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:25,789
to Python is in my in my job 4 + +

00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,249
dot-com delay you and I teach beginners

00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:33,950
medium advanced but I've only just

00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:38,869
learned about the question mark a recap

00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:42,950
pythonic means using Python idioms well

00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:46,519
with it sorry with emphasis on

00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:49,599
readability that's important emphasis on

00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,279
readability what's important in Python

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,249
thank you yes what do we love about

00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:57,710
Python it's readable it's understandable

00:48:55,249 --> 00:49:01,329
it's logical it's sensible it's obvious

00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:05,239
in the Zen of Python tim Peter says

00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:07,099
readability counts he also says there

00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:10,970
should be one and preferably only one

00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:13,249
obvious way to do it Paul Dubois wrote

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,910
for maintainability is Python it has

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,850
simple clean syntax

00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:35,960
Grado said about python being an

00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,390
experiment and how much freedom

00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:43,640
programmers need too much freedom and

00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:46,190
nobody can read another's code in Python

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,930
a beginner can read anybody's Python

00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,380
code which is a wonderful thing for

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:53,150
people that'll learn just because

00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,060
another language has a feature or a

00:49:53,150 --> 00:50:01,190
characteristic I'm talking to you flip

00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:04,580
flop Erb is not a reason for Python to

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:06,350
adopt it I have done a lot of work in

00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,540
Perl and Perl has lots of things that

00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:12,620
Python doesn't have it has until loops

00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:17,230
and unless tests and labeled breaks and

00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:19,870
a bazillion operators and that may be

00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:24,470
something that's had an effect on its

00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:26,390
use there's a new pet pet 505 I want to

00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,880
talk about pet 505 here are some

00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,260
examples from the pep in that pet

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,540
there's a bit of code there that

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,450
somebody didn't like I don't know about

00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,580
you I like that code I understand that

00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,200
code I get that code that code makes

00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,440
sense I don't have a problem with that

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,810
code are you with me on that code it

00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,260
looks pretty clear but they wanted to

00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:50,780
reduce the number of lines from - down -

00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,740
well now that needs a comment so it's

00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,740
now down to two

00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,010
and there was another bit of code that

00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,670
was like that and look to be honest I'm

00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:04,790
not a huge fan of the ear fields but

00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,700
after updating it becomes question marks

00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:10,500
thoroughly why not

00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:14,730
and/or now admittedly that's four lines

00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,730
of code but I'm paid per line so I like

00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:20,700
that code this is some more examples

00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:24,990
from that pip I don't know about you but

00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,910
I'm having trouble man and the second

00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,650
example from the pip says don't try this

00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,970
at home and now I'm not actually sure

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:34,860
whether they're talking about the

00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:37,590
question mark question mark or the RM

00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:41,240
tree I think it's the question mark

00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,240
question mark you can now write this

00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:49,620
yeah yeah me too

00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:55,740
what that which actually I was sorry I

00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:58,770
got that wrong it was supposed to be so

00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,480
reddit doesn't like it the tricky bit is

00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,000
that Python does need to grow and

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,160
increase and become bigger and to serve

00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,380
ever more diverse groups and learners

00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,550
and peoples and tasks but we don't want

00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,560
to lose what we've got

00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:14,520
so this pep hasn't been accepted yet

00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:16,200
it's in draft and what I would say for

00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,910
those who are on my warnings talk today

00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:23,550
mornings and do not use core devs please

00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:25,110
rethink this remember what we've got so

00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:28,260
that we don't lose that wonderful

00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:29,460
readability in Python or alternatively

00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,890
maybe we should just add the flip

00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:36,050
flopper reader thank you

00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,050
[Music]

00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,090
I'm I'm looking forward to to coming

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,680
back to this in two or three years time

00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,060
when maybe one of the three operators

00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:51,310
gets accepted in a slightly different

00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:55,150
form so we're down to our last lightning

00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:58,120
talk which is Phillip James who's going

00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:03,160
to talk about giving thanks hi can

00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:04,960
everyone hear me great since I have you

00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,310
all I'm gonna hold a chocolate birds of

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,900
a feather tomorrow chocolate Boff bring

00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,910
chocolate share chocolates look at that

00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,650
other way hi there my name is Phillip

00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,660
James and to be honest I'm not entirely

00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,000
sure the right way to start this talk

00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,100
chocolate was a good start because this

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,720
talk is about gratitude and gratitude is

00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,090
often a tricky thing to talk about in

00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,590
public sincere gratitude can make people

00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,420
uncomfortable because the receiver often

00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,030
didn't do their work for praise but for

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,860
the joy of the work itself to make this

00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,870
easier I'd like to start by expressing

00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,460
my sincere gratitude to someone who

00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,650
isn't here guido van rossum

00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,000
without his invention of Python and his

00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,160
decision to share it with the world I

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,450
might not have the career I have and I

00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,400
wouldn't have met some of my closest

00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,660
friends many of whom are in this room

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,990
thank you

00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,990
Guido

00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,110
but python is not just Guido and has not

00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,610
been for many years

00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,050
Python is the community the core

00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,760
maintainer is the package maintainer is

00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,170
the event organizers and all the people

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,510
in this room and all the other people

00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:03,070
that work in Python and I want to make

00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:05,650
it easier to thank all of them as well

00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:07,840
in February and no developer named

00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,950
Pharos released thanks an NPM package

00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,990
for listening all the packages of

00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,250
project depends on and where those

00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:15,190
packages could be funded as a way of

00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,930
giving thanks he released his work right

00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,430
before Pike Tennessee and while I was

00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,290
attending that conference I was inspired

00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:23,290
by the question could we do something

00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:25,300
similar for Python so over the course of

00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,040
PI Tennessee I built thanks for Python a

00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,070
Python package for helping you give back

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,870
to the Python package do you depend on

00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,430
the original version looked like this it

00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,440
scanned your requirements cut text and

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,390
using a local JSON database of all the

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,890
package information I could find printed

00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,070
out where you could support the packages

00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:44,290
your project depends on at PyCon us

00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:47,050
thanks to some truly heroic efforts by

00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:48,880
Tom Marx it now takes in pip files and

00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,880
specific package names as well as

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,440
requirement set text files additionally

00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,270
I worked with the Python packaging

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,330
Authority to get funding URLs added to

00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:59,860
the recommended spec for Python packages

00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,350
you can now add funding URLs to a

00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,540
packages setup I and that URL will show

00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:06,400
up on the project's PI pi page the

00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,170
obvious next step was to get the thanks

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,590
package reading from a project set up

00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:13,840
top I rather than a local database and

00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,130
this is what thanks does today you'll

00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,660
notice the way to thank column is

00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,280
tragically blank for most projects

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,410
because most projects haven't added

00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,140
funding URLs this is where I need your

00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:24,970
help for the projects you use or are

00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,890
involved in please think about adding a

00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:28,330
funding URL to the set up top PI so we

00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,640
can know where to direct people who want

00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,770
to support the project we can only help

00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,950
projects be sustainable if we know where

00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:37,150
to sustain them if you in this room can

00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,920
help be the change we need to make the

00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:43,170
Python ecosystem more sustainable than

00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,170
you like Guido will have my thanks

00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,710
[Music]

00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:57,940
thanks fella that is the end of our

00:55:53,710 --> 00:56:01,059
lightning talks for today I am sorry I

00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:03,009
have two cards here which is the short

00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:04,660
list that I've unilaterally decided

00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:06,940
you're going to vote on for the most

00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,309
popular lightning talk of today and the

00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:17,799
prize for it is this wonderful piece of

00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:21,640
extruded plastic from in staved the

00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:24,039
shortlist consists of the lightning talk

00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:29,349
that was an unfortunate dare from Tom

00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:35,740
Eastman the flip-flop operator by Mary

00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:37,779
McLeod or the presentation from felicity

00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:42,249
whose co-conspirator refused to join her

00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:44,680
on stage can we have a round of applause

00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:47,470
and we'll judge this by applause so can

00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,890
we have applause for Aaron's flip-flop

00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,890
operator

00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:59,540
okay thank you and applause for Felicity

00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:05,409
Robson's captured cracker

00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:05,409
[Applause]

00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:19,320
here you get the giant pipe and savvy

00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:22,670
staff thing congratulations and thank

00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,670
you right

00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,930
before I hand over to the KDS there are

00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:33,930
more lightning talks tomorrow at roughly

00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:36,990
this time registrations for lightning

00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:39,510
talks will open up after the the keynote

00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:44,730
in the morning if you want to present

00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:46,710
one feel free to write in a writer title

00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:49,260
and and write your name on it the more

00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,280
detail you give me the more I will know

00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,750
what you're going to be talking about

00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,910
and the more I can decide whether or not

00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:56,849
it's going to be good on art so lots of

00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:58,650
detail in your submissions if you can so

00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:00,420
can we please have a round of applause

00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,750
for our lightning talk presenters for

00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,750
today

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:20,830
and here's Katie more claps okay how

00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:23,470
about four we have two lectern so we

00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:35,830
also have two Katy's let's give it up

00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:38,400
the Katie Bell I am back up Katie we

00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,600
should have a conference about Katie's

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,930
that would be pretty cool yeah

00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,730
wonder what we call it anyway as as

00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:48,700
Chris said more lightning talks tomorrow

00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:58,150
we do have a second staff so you could

00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:59,640
earn yourself a staff so we have a

00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:03,280
self-organized dinner because there's

00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:09,460
650 of you and you'll won't fit into a

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:12,190
pub so KB yes this is the first year

00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,410
that we're trying this so apologize if

00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:15,880
it's got you know if we have a few kinks

00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:18,490
to work out I would appreciate your

00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,880
feedback if we could go to the next

00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,130
slide please

00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,950
we're essentially trying to solve this

00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,660
problem and this is not a problem

00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,220
going up to people and saying hey hey

00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:29,350
Frank's going to dinner can I join you

00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,900
is not a problem the problem is that

00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:33,280
this is a really hard thing to do right

00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,050
if you don't know those people

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,860
look a little bit crazy with their arms

00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:40,690
up going after a group of people and

00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,310
saying hey I'm new to this conference

00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:44,710
want to get to know a couple of people

00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,790
and saying can I join you for dinner cuz

00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,620
that's a really good way to get to know

00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:50,290
people that is a really hard thing to do

00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:53,070
and so we've set up this as a time to

00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:55,810
make that easier to do okay so it's very

00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:59,110
unstructured but basically we are

00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:02,020
designating the time directly after this

00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:04,240
session immediately outside here to be

01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:07,990
this is the time where it's okay to do

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:11,830
this okay it's okay to wave your arms

01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:13,660
around but it's also okay to go up to

01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:15,580
people that you don't know and say hey

01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:21,600
are you folks going to dinner can I join

01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:21,600
you okay there is a process to this

01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,170
there's not a lot of process and it's a

01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:27,480
very flexible process and if you want to

01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:29,580
follow not this process that's okay

01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,250
first step is to gather into a group of

01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:34,110
people that is large enough that you

01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,050
have people in that group who you don't

01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:38,940
know okay if you have too many people

01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,010
that you know and everyone knows

01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,320
everyone else split into two groups if

01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,840
you are a small group people will come

01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,760
up to you and say hey I folks going to

01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,010
dinner can I join you and then you say

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,450
y-yes our group is small you should join

01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:56,640
us once you get to sort of 810 people

01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:59,160
it's getting a little bit hard to all

01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,660
find a table in a restaurant feel free

01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,890
to say actually we're already kind of

01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,870
big at this point and we already have a

01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:06,030
mixture of people I'm sure there will be

01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:07,800
other people around if we end up with

01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,480
there's a bunch of people left around

01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,930
who don't have a group we're gonna put

01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,640
them in a group and so it will work out

01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:17,970
again if you're not participating in

01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,840
this that's fine the next step and this

01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:21,600
is the hardest part

01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,220
choosing a restaurant and this is

01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,900
because people think that choosing the

01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,060
restaurant means that they are their

01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,220
personal reputation is tied to that

01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:31,620
restaurant if I choose the restaurant

01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:33,720
and people don't like the restaurant

01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:37,710
maybe the foods a little bit of or the

01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:40,920
phone off but like here oh they mixed up

01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:42,570
my order clearly Katie chose this

01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:46,830
restaurant clearly Katie is a terrible

01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:48,360
person don't overthink it the

01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:50,820
restaurants there's lots of great

01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,910
restaurants around does everything will

01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:55,920
be fine we have in fact prepared a

01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,390
selection of restaurants which we think

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,880
are big enough that they will probably

01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:03,210
be able to accommodate a large group on

01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,000
a Saturday night those restaurants are

01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:07,920
on cards on a pin board over at the Red

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,210
Door desk if you are having trouble in

01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,460
your group trying to pick a restaurant

01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:13,740
should come over to the red Roy desk and

01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,510
pick a restaurant the things to be aware

01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,460
of so don't worry too much about making

01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:20,880
sure that the restaurant has like 4.5

01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:23,580
stars on some rating system do you think

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,140
about the price range of the restaurant

01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,300
we've labeled the price ranges on the

01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,860
restaurants that we have one dollar sign

01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,080
means you can eat from the twenty

01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,520
dollars two dollar signs means you can

01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,870
probably can get a meal for under $40

01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,820
three dollar sign

01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:42,000
means you might not have any students in

01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:44,580
your group sir but do be aware of price

01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,870
do be aware of dietary requirements some

01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,670
restaurants are better at vegetarian

01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:49,380
food than others if someone has specific

01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,990
requirements have a look at the menu

01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:54,690
online that kind of thing okay once

01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:57,360
you've gotten through the hard part it

01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:59,340
is a Saturday night be flexible if the

01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,300
restaurant is booked out most of the

01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,130
restaurants are we've picked our in

01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,870
areas that have lots of restaurants just

01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:07,800
go to the one next door or find another

01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:09,990
one we have the internet this is okay if

01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,760
you are having trouble I will be on

01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:13,440
slack we can coordinate in the

01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,390
socializing channel and people can say

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,920
hey our restaurant has lots of extra

01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:21,090
space maybe we could fit another group

01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,040
here okay we are also going relatively

01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,420
early for dinner and early for early

01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,190
dinner means we have a much better

01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:29,000
chance of being able to get restaurants

01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,210
right to get tables in busy restaurants

01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,840
okay

01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,620
the last step is go eat dinner together

01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,860
this is the easy part

01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:40,080
this is the fun part enjoy each other's

01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:41,430
company if you find that you have dinner

01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,440
this was great I want to keep

01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,610
socializing but now I'm with these

01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,900
people that I don't know when they're

01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,820
all going to bed because they're tired

01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,920
and it's been a bit long day

01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,350
the socializing channel on slack is

01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,940
still there last night people were great

01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:56,190
they were posting hey a bunch of us are

01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,770
going to this pub bunch of us are going

01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,240
here keep doing that that's really

01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:03,540
awesome you should always be able to

01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,490
find other PyCon people until you reach

01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,230
the limit of your socializing capacity

01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:10,170
and then you should probably go home and

01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,150
sleep okay are there any questions

01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,920
should we do open questions or actually

01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,900
we might just do questions over at the

01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,600
read your desk and I'm gonna go stand at

01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:21,120
the read your desk and help people find

01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:24,240
restaurants so what I'm gonna do is I'm

01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,070
gonna keep talking well kdb runs all the

01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,090
way up the aisle hands over a mic and

01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,090
runs all the way up the aisle

01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:41,499
