so contributing to open source for the

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,450
first time can be daunting Tomatoes

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,429
Kunze is the developer behind pre talks

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,259
the open source Django based software

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,240
powering the call for proposals and

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,529
scheduled for this weekend and he's

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,630
going to show us what we need to know

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,240
for our first django contribution please

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,830
make the buyers feel welcome hello

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,590
everybody

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,380
first off let me introduce myself a tiny

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,870
bit I'm not a django core developer in

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,059
fact i only started working with django

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,129
a couple of years ago and then i started

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,750
contributing like on and off once or

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,210
twice a year when I ran into other

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,329
django people and felt like yeah I

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,850
really I really should do that so I'm

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,219
actually here is somebody who is not

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,559
terribly experienced and a fairly new

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,570
contributor because I ran into a couple

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,090
of problems when contributing and

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,739
stumbling blocks here and there and I

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,690
just want to help you avoid the

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,910
stumbling blocks so this talk is

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,760
primarily about Django because Django is

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,750
a bit special in its open-source set up

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,720
in that it uses different systems for

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,299
its tickets and its pull requests so

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,210
every slide will have an icon in the

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,850
upper left corner and it will be the paw

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,430
for tickets because the ticket system is

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,130
track and that's its logo it will be the

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,799
very Victorian octocat for github and

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,390
then it will be the Django Pony for any

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,150
interactions you will have with the

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,710
community the pictures actually

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,130
illustrations from the original Django

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,290
days when Django began so original from

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,610
we have some people around who were he

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,799
event so they can confirm that right so

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,600
Django is a pretty cool project I hope

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
you agree since you're sitting here

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,229
maybe you just agree that contributing

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,320
to open source project is good in

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,659
general and even though Django is a

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,390
fairly stable and old project it still

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,759
requires community help to stay alive

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,210
and healthy right because if it

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,069
stagnates nobody wins and the first

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,709
thing you have to do if you want to

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,800
contribute to Django is to acquire a

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,850
ticket every contribution to Django

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,980
apart from basically tiny typo fixes

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:22,770
have a ticket on the Django ticket

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,860
system if you want to contribute a new

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,470
feature that's a different process that

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,480
I can't go into here right now as that

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,390
you might want to look up the DEP

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,580
process or the jungle enhancement

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,410
proposal process or get in touch with

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,600
the Django developers mailing list if

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,400
you find a bug and you want to fix it

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,800
that still means opening a ticket first

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,780
because the ticket system is there so we

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,600
can refer back to it right so that we

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,430
can figure out years after the fact why

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,600
a certain commit was made and if there

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,240
was discussion on it and so on so Django

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,460
currently has just under 1,300 open

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,640
tickets so you might think that finding

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,920
a ticket to work on is easy but yeah not

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,410
quite because most of those tickets have

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,150
been open for quite a long time and most

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,400
of them have been open for a good reason

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,140
so either they are far trickier than

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,660
they look or they don't look easy to

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,150
begin with so how do you get started

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,250
first off you head over to code or

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,080
Django project comm despite the name

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,260
that's not where our code lives that's

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,670
where the tickets live and despite the

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,290
fact that you don't that you are

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,000
searching for tickets you are not

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,150
clicking search you're clicking view

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,220
tickets it's bear with me it's going to

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,310
be alright and if you do that you'll

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,680
arrive at this fancy interface which

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,200
allows you to build basically arbitrary

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:49,110
query queries against the ticket system

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,820
tickets have States and tickets have

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,459
people who take care of them and then

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,090
people tickets have flags and you can

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,160
filter for all of them or none of them

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,440
among those flags is a flag called easy

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,150
pickings now you might think that this

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,150
is a good idea to get started with and

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,820
theoretically yes it is but out of these

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,790
1,300 just under 1,300 open tickets

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,680
there are roughly 10 or maybe six

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,900
depending on the day easy pickings

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
because naturally you know as easy

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,440
pickings get open people are like oh

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,440
cool and easy ticket let me work on that

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,419
and boom they're gone so your chances of

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,139
finding and actually open easy ticket

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,240
and that high so

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,009
the Django documentation which isn't

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,370
that helpful at this stage but we'll

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:36,560
we'll get back to that later on has the

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,530
pretty good recommendation of filtering

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,849
buy tickets that are unassigned and open

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,669
which is the first filter you are

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,469
offered by default and then just

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,330
choosing a component that you want to

00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:48,949
work on now this is really good advice

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,810
if you already know what you want to

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,819
work on right if you say I want to work

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,180
on models and databases so you choose

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,050
the ORM and you will find one hundred

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,150
and eighty tickets

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,830
good luck choosing one or you might work

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,870
on the documentation which also has a

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,969
lot of tickets which makes this hard but

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,270
maybe you are interested in in a smaller

00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:10,669
component like internationalization

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,279
where you will only find five unsigned

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:16,189
or open tickets so that is a good way to

00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,819
start if you're not sure which component

00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,800
you want to work on or if choosing among

00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:24,020
over a hundred open tickets is too much

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,580
for you to go through there's another

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:31,759
thing you can do we have about 200 open

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,830
pull requests at any point in time but

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,319
on the ticket system we also have a flag

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,560
the flag is called has patch which is

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,919
basically has a pull request and we have

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:47,360
about 500 just over 500 I think tickets

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,800
marked hairs patch so what happened with

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,889
all the others that are not open for

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,990
requests well those were pull requests

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,270
at one point in time but then they got

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,550
closed because the original pull request

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,770
author didn't respond anymore because

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,810
they you know life gets in the way you

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,939
open the pro requests you receive review

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,490
two weeks later but then you're on

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,620
vacation or something or you are writing

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,020
an exam and suddenly you've forgotten

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,939
all about it and then three months later

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,500
or six months later somebody comes along

00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:21,560
and closes the per request as inactive

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:24,770
so those are tickets where some people

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,039
already got went through the trouble of

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,689
implementing part of the change set and

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,150
then somebody else went through the

00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,620
trouble of reviewing that so you can

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,719
choose to build on that instead of

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,219
starting you know in the middle of

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,810
nowhere

00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:40,849
you can find those tickets either here

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,039
on the ticket system or by

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,899
just going to github and filtering the

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,569
clothes for requests by the word

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:50,300
inactivity because usually somebody will

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:53,270
leave a comment that says closed due to

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,409
inactivity and so you can choose among

00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:00,319
those but no matter how you arrive at

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,899
your ticket once you have chosen the

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,830
ticket you want to work on you need to

00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:08,389
assign it to yourself that's just this

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,369
small form way down the page on the

00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,800
ticket and the ticket system where you

00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:17,269
can just click assign to and by default

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,789
it will put in your github username just

00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,050
do that because if you don't do that

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,909
chances are somebody else will start

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,360
working on the ticket and then you know

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:28,519
that's a bit sad because the first

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,199
person to open the proquest will will

00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,849
feel a bit guilty if somebody else's

00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,729
around and if you are the second person

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,709
to open up or request you will feel a

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:40,129
bit frustrated because somebody else

00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:43,159
already did all the work right but now

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:46,490
that you have got a ticket you can start

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,800
working on it it's pretty hard to give

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,680
good advice how to work on a ticket

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,059
because takers are wildly different like

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,219
tiny documentation tickets and there are

00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:58,249
huge documentation tickets there are

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,499
super tricky lrm tickets that go deep

00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:03,169
into database specifics and then there

00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:06,199
are tiny fixes in forms and then there

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,789
are horrible fixes in forms that will

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,899
take you forever to wrap your head

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:13,819
around so I would like to refer you to

00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,189
the contributing documentation at this

00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:20,059
stage because the contributing dogs are

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:22,490
a lot to go through so they're not the

00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,999
best place to start but once you have a

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,559
ticket

00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,769
they're super helpful because they're

00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:30,919
very specific there are like 18 thousand

00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:33,500
words on 13 pages so that's really a

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,789
small novella but once you know what

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,979
you're looking for they're very helpful

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,740
because there's a one page to help you

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,779
make commits so if you don't have a lot

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,639
of experience or any experience really

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,110
with version control systems they point

00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,540
you in the right directions on how to

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,730
get started with git and github by

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,730
pointing you at other documentation for

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,009
that and they tell you the style guides

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,279
and so on

00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:04,639
I have some general advice though and

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:07,670
that to be rigorous in your work it's a

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,970
matter of courtesy towards everybody

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,679
else working on the project to put in a

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,360
good effort that doesn't mean at all

00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:16,009
that you can't make mistakes you know

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,660
making mistakes and pull requests that's

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,610
basically what they're there for right

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,199
for requests are there for you to make a

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,029
mistake and somebody else to catch it

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:26,540
and tell you about it and you to work

00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,369
together and figure it out but it will

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,189
be less frustrating to you and everybody

00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:34,100
else if you take care to look at a

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:36,769
couple of points before you submit your

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,929
pour request the first one of those and

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,749
this doesn't apply to documentation

00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:45,019
tickets but anything else to ride tests

00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:47,059
or modify tests maybe because Django is

00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:50,720
a very very stable software product and

00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:54,470
it is that way and it stays that way by

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,480
having well tested code nothing will get

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,949
merged without having tests now it's

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,139
perfectly all right not to have tests at

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,970
first and then figure out with help how

00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:04,100
to write tests because that's not always

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,379
straightforward it might not even be

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,839
clear where those tests are because in

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:10,759
Django the tests are you know Django

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,740
itself a structure pretty well but the

00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,449
tests are a bit all over the place so

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,490
you will have to search the code a bit

00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:18,920
to find tests that are similar to the

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,290
ones you're looking to write and then

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,050
modify those or maybe just add to

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,790
existing tests but in any case you

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,759
should write us and once you've written

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,459
tests you should run them like you don't

00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,610
need to run all tests because Django has

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,379
a lot of tests and especially you don't

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,389
need to run all tests against all

00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,889
databases because we have the test

00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,129
runners for that when you open a pull

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:45,649
request your pull request will will be

00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,689
pushed to the the Jenkins test Runner

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,389
and then a lot of tests will be run

00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:52,790
against all kinds of databases and

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:55,449
patent versions and so on but locally

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,100
you should try to get the tests that

00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:01,040
concern your change set and the tests

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,559
you wrote or modify to pass because it's

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,410
just super frustrating to push your pull

00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,450
request and then five hours later or

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,060
something some hours later to see it

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,250
test failure and then to go back and

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,140
modify the test push again and again

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,540
five hours later you've nearly forgotten

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,480
what you've even worked on you see

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,990
another test failure and so on

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,820
I mentioned documentation in any case

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,530
regardless of this if this is a

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,220
documentation ticket or not you should

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,930
write documentation you know if it's a

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,630
type of fix maybe not but other than

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,550
that if you modify any code people

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,950
cannot take advantage of that if they

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,870
don't know what you've done even if it's

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,730
a tiny bug fix that should probably go

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,040
into the release notes so that people

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,580
who ran into the same bag know that it's

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,870
fixed by now so tests and documentation

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,300
ZAR minimum requirement for most

00:11:52,870 --> 00:12:00,560
requests to get merged next to that you

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,840
should also run linters or mostly I sort

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,730
which salts imports because it's really

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,370
frustrating to open a pull request and

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,590
then to see a red bill just because some

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,990
import was in the wrong location because

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,970
come on really but we have I thought

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,860
which solves the imports for you so it

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,780
doesn't go and yell at you and say this

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,220
import is wrong it just goes ahead and

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,750
fixes it

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,810
you should also refer to the

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:27,020
documentation page on coding style this

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,420
is something that's only would you only

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,460
need to listen to now because in the

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,920
near future hopefully Django will start

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,040
to use black which is an automatic code

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,200
formatter so instead you will then just

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,330
be able to run black and not think about

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,550
code formatting but we're not there yet

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,550
so right now you should read the page on

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,440
coding style again unless this is just

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,140
not just but unless this is a

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,250
documentation ticket and figure out if

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,590
your code matches that style and finally

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,810
you should also make sure that your

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,220
commit message complies to a commit

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,110
message format which is in the

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,940
documentation again it's just a tiny

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,650
thing and frustrating if somebody else

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,950
has to fix it this checklist is really

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:16,760
just a help for you I'm pretty sure that

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,160
I forgot any of these points at some

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,810
point in time in any Interpol request I

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,620
made it just happens and it's not

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,810
horrible

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,820
it happens to everybody and review is

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,130
there to catch it but you're making your

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:31,220
life and the reviewers life easier and

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,200
frustration free if you go through this

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,170
checklist once before opening the pull

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,670
request in the very end and finally

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,120
while you're working on a pull request

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,550
you will it's likely all it's probable

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,290
that you will run into something where

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,270
you don't really know how to solve it

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,310
that just happens Jango is a huge and

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,470
complex project and some tickets are

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,890
really hard and so on it's perfectly

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,830
valid to go and get help there are a lot

00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,690
of channels now that you're here you can

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,190
maybe if you're going to Sprint's you

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,680
should use the Sprint's to get help

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,750
because Sprint's are super cool to

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,940
collaborate with experienced developers

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,680
and go ahead and talk to them if you

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,839
don't know what to do or if you run into

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,670
a problem but you can also use the

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,980
various mailing lists wrangle developers

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,200
for larger questions Jango call

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,510
mentorship which is very undervalued for

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,670
for smaller questions because they're

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,620
experienced developers standing by

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,290
basically waiting for you to have any

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,560
trouble with your pull request hoping to

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,209
guide you along you can use the IRC

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,070
Channel Django dev if you have a bit of

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:36,680
time to wait for a response because that

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,020
can take a bit or you can also open a

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,000
work-in-progress pull request basically

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,709
open a pull request and make a note this

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,260
is work in progress because this and

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,540
this isn't working yet could you advise

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,980
me on how to proceed but has the

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,270
advantage that everybody knows what

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,850
you're talking about because you can

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:55,100
point at the code you wrote already and

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,910
say I'm not sure what this is supposed

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,339
to do so on and once you've opened your

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,660
pull request I'm afraid you are going to

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:04,550
have to wait a bit

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,890
because Django is mostly run by

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,770
volunteers not entirely we have the two

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,690
wonderful fellows paid by the Django

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,120
Software Foundation Carleton and Marius

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,950
who are paid to take care of the project

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,810
basically but they have a lot to do they

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,270
take care of incoming issues they take

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,760
care of poor requests they do the entire

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,920
release management including security

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,640
releases including back ports and so on

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,620
so this is a good thing it's normal for

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,200
software projects especially open source

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,600
projects to just take some time until

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,730
you get a reaction so

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,459
just basically expectation management

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,040
you can't expect for it to take a couple

00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:46,910
of hours before you get a first response

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,360
or maybe a day and it will on a median

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,149
over the last year it took a bit over

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,800
two year two weeks not two years two

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,199
weeks for a pull request to get merged

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,490
because you know you go through a review

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,009
cycle and so on so two weeks I think a

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,389
good figure to look at smaller pull

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,420
requests will be faster

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:12,170
mostly hopefully and larger will take

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:14,709
longer but while you're waiting you can

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,779
help the Django project because you

00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:21,199
maybe hopefully presumably haven't got

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,699
anything else to do well you know but

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,889
you still can help the Django project

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,980
that would be really cool and you can do

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,490
that by way of ticket triage and by way

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,949
of pure quest review ticket triage is a

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,959
pretty cool thing to do because there

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,839
are a lot of tickets just under 1,300

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,509
and the Django fellows are very proud of

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,589
having gone below that number that's why

00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,290
I'm stressing it like that

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,180
and you can help them by going to - Pato

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,579
triangle project comm which provides

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,819
handy inks to pre-filtered lists of

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:55,160
tickets and you can for instance look at

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,870
the unreviewed tickets which are tickets

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,970
that have just been opened and nobody

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,160
else has looked at them yet and what you

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,290
can do there is you can either move them

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,990
to accept it if you can reproduce the

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,299
issue or if you agree that this is a

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,289
thing that should be introduced and so

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:14,600
on or you can find out that there's that

00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:16,549
you can't reproduce it or that this has

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,289
been discussed previously or you can

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,299
close it as a duplicate because it has

00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,850
been fixed already or has its own ticket

00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:24,230
already so by searching on the Django

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,100
developer's mailing list and on the

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,750
ticket systems you can figure out what

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,640
to do with this ticket and this is

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,539
basically a way of keeping the Django

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,000
project inbox clean they're usually just

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,710
about 20 tickets lying around there

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,140
because the Django fellows are really

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,360
good at working with those and if you

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,220
don't want to work with new tickets you

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,260
can do the opposite and work with very

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,240
old tickets because we have tickets that

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,370
are lie

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,380
have been open ten years ago and the

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,720
last activity on those tickers was ten

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,760
years ago so it's not at all obvious

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,070
that asked the relevant to anything

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,030
because Django has changed a lot in ten

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:07,000
years so even if you take the ticket and

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,440
just figure out if it still applies

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,600
recently I closed the ticket that

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,760
proposed that it would be a great idea

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,070
if we could started rendering forms with

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,690
templates instead of code which has been

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,400
around at this point for I think three

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,420
years or so but nobody got around to

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,010
closing the tickets and if you figure

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,770
out if this ticket still applies just

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,420
leave a live a comment just say yeah on

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,070
the current Django master this would

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,780
still be a good idea or we don't have

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,290
this feature yet because if somebody

00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,150
comes along in another year it would be

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,220
really helpful to see oh yeah that's

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,200
that's still the thing or at least the

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,920
what it was a thing a year ago and not

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,230
it was the thing eleven years ago and

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,690
the other thing that you can do is you

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,780
can review tickets review per requests

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,250
you can either go to a best way to do

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,620
this is to go to - bot or Django project

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,020
comm again and then there's a link to

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,600
Petrus needing review which is basically

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,730
all tickets where none of the flags have

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,530
been said that indicate that something

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,020
has been reviewed so there are three

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,690
flags for tickets that have been

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:15,760
reviewed those are needs tests and needs

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,910
docs and needs improvement and if none

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,640
of those flags have been said or the

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,050
ticket has not is not in the state ready

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,910
for check-in which is the alternative

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,179
it's a good prayer request you should

00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,400
just measure it you can review it the

00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,020
workflow is you find the ticket you read

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,210
through the code which you need to do

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,070
you need read through with the ticket

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,940
because you need the context of what was

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:42,580
proposed and discussed and then you get

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,380
arrived at a judgement like this looks

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,780
good this doesn't look good this person

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,230
forgot this step in our handy put

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,200
request

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:53,140
checklist something like that and then

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,690
you both set the appropriate flags on

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,730
track on the ticket and you leave a

00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,240
comment on github if you're really nice

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,070
you will recommend every remind the

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,650
protocol

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,900
or that they have to change the flags if

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,700
they update their pull request so if you

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,420
said the flag needs tests and they push

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,650
tests they have the to remove that flag

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,100
because otherwise that ticket will not

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:21,240
end up in a review pipeline and that

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,540
will be bad other than that again review

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,550
is as complex as submitting code so I

00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,550
can't give any general advice apart from

00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,080
being a very empathetic with the per

00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,270
request author because they took time

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,090
and took on effort to make this happen

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,870
and be very clear because you will lose

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,060
some context in written communications

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:45,810
don't play the blame game don't point

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,880
fingers try to be very very you know use

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:49,590
objective phrasing don't say you forgot

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,710
the dog string say this method needs a

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,740
dog string which is much nicer right be

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:58,170
friendly and positive just offer an

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,440
opinion instead of offering the absolute

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,900
judgement and also have a look because

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,540
this is a really large topic that where

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,820
there are books and talks and everything

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,620
look at the tour code review skills for

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,330
pie thermistors by Nina Zakharchenko

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,860
because that's a really good talk that

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,210
mentions a lot of things that are

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:20,190
important and if you hang around and

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,070
review other poor requests and sri

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,990
articles and so on and maybe just go

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,630
outside enjoy the sun sooner or later

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,650
your request will be reviewed and again

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,810
treat the review like you treated

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:36,300
reviewing other people by taking it as a

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,100
friendly review assume positive intent

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,350
don't take it personally because the

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,720
django community is really really cool

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,150
and good about things like that they are

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,890
not judging you they are just offering

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,630
friendly advice to improve your pull

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,390
request so that it can be merged into

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,610
django they are there to help if both

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,310
sides show empathy towards each other

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,440
there's a very rewarding and helpful

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,090
process and you can learn a lot it's a

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,490
conversation so you don't have to do

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,920
anything the review SS it's perfectly

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,440
alright to get back to them and say yeah

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,860
but I'm of the opinion that this is good

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,950
the way it is because and it's also

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,539
perfectly all right to ask for private

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,399
clarification as

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,619
especially you know like I am not a

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:21,960
native speaker so sometimes things are

00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,639
just not quite clear and maybe I'm not

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,859
feeling comfortable with discussing this

00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:27,690
in public so I'll ping the person

00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,549
privately and say did you mean this or

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,029
did you mean that or can you clarify and

00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,710
then once we figured out where we where

00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,989
we didn't understand each other I will

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,489
post a summary of what we discussed so

00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,889
that everybody else is up to date with

00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:42,869
that and if you stick around with that

00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:45,509
sooner or later your pull request will

00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:47,820
be merged congratulations this is a

00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:49,649
moment if you arrived at this moment you

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,389
really should take the time to enjoy it

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:53,789
because it's super cool you helped a

00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:55,830
cool project to stay alive you

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,629
contributed you I'm sure you learned

00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,700
something at least about the tools

00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:01,830
surrounding it but probably about Django

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,139
too because you got into some Django

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,820
details especially with documentation

00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:07,769
for requests you will learn a lot

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,470
because to document something you have

00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:16,379
to understand it and that often leads

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:18,710
down a deep deep rabbit hole in my and

00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:22,979
maybe our enthusiasm to get started we

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,470
kind of started at step one but this

00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:30,119
being programming we left out the zeroth

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:33,720
step which is when should you contribute

00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,159
to Django and I want to be very very

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,190
clear about this this is not a matter of

00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,590
skill like at all regardless of your

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,809
experience with programming or anything

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,849
there is a Django ticket that you can

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,830
work on if you want to especially

00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:49,169
documentation tickets are great for

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,929
getting into Django and getting

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:54,090
experience with that but especially if

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:58,200
you take the path of choosing a podcast

00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,899
somebody else has worked on that's also

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,849
a great way to get into this whole pull

00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:05,609
request thing and getting into

00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:07,739
contributions what you should consider

00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:09,690
instead of your skill which really

00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:13,710
really is sufficient to contribute to

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:16,889
Django is if you have just currently the

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,840
resources to contribute to Django if you

00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:22,080
have the time and if you have the mental

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,999
energy if it's alright for you to kind

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,879
of commit you know it's alright to drop

00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:29,250
a pull request if you can't continue but

00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,870
at first you commit to

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,260
taking on this pull request and trying

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,970
to see it through and it's perfectly all

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,070
right to decide that at the time you

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,600
just don't have the resources that you

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,850
want to use Django but can't contribute

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,240
currently or if you want to contribute

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,040
it's a really good strategy that was

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,290
also recommended by back Halton our

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,970
Django fellow in his talk at django con

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,000
Europe this year which you should also

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,640
watch it's really good to set boundaries

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,140
ahead of time like say I'm going to

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,420
contribute to Django and I'm going to

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,220
spend I don't know at most an hour a

00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,110
week or maybe more or maybe less

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,090
depending on your circumstances or maybe

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,130
a week is not a good time slice for you

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,960
but you'll figure it out because this

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,910
prevents you from being very

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,830
enthusiastic and saying oh this is a

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,990
cool ticket and this one and this one

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,630
too and I'm going to open all the pull

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,600
requests and then two weeks later the

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,310
reviews are starting to you know pile up

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,440
and you're going to be like how what was

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,050
this ticket about all I don't really

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,400
want to do that right now

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,950
so by limiting yourself first you

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,930
preventing yourself from getting

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,560
overwhelmed or even burning out but at

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:40,710
first I think getting overwhelmed that

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,570
said all of these things I'd really like

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,850
to encourage you to contribute to Django

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,530
because it's a really good community you

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,080
will meet wonderful people you will

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,060
learn a lot because you will write code

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,100
or documentation and you will in any

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,850
case read code which isn't super

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,800
important skill to have when you work in

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,020
any capacity with code no matter if you

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,840
are a documentarian or a coder or

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,580
technical writer or whatever and you

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,010
will help keep triangle healthy which is

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,650
cool itself and you will learn from the

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:13,260
people directly which is very different

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,870
from learning from you know the

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,950
documentation or personal experience and

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:22,830
it's a great thing to do I also want to

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,420
mention that code and pro requests are

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,900
not the only ways to contribute to

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,810
Django

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,300
you can also participate for instance in

00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,780
Django girls workshops as an attendee or

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,610
as a mentor you can attend events or

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,100
meetups or you can organize them which

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,799
is also a very cool thing to do if a lot

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,929
of work you can help with

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,059
submission review for events because

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,710
community events like PyCon will ask

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,049
other people to help them review

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,789
incoming submissions right to figure out

00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,840
what is appropriate and what's a good

00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:56,610
talk you can test Django the Django

00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,289
master or Django pre-releases to figure

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,419
out if they work with your projects you

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,590
can write cool third-party applications

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,809
you can find ideas that are good in

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,350
other ecosystems and apply them to

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:12,120
Django like figure out if they apply

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,270
cleanly we had a great talk on the rust

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,909
community today here and many of those

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:21,240
principles might be a very very good

00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:23,490
idea too for Django to embrace and if

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,020
you're in a position to do so you could

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,570
also try to get your company involved

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,250
like if you are and only if you are in a

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,080
position to do so and you use Django at

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,059
work it might be a good idea to talk to

00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,830
your company about supporting Django and

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,640
the DSF financially on any other

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:41,970
capacity so I'm nearly out of time here

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,610
so I'm going to refer you to my website

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,250
where this presentation is online where

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,710
I've also collected a lot of links which

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,020
wouldn't work here very well in any case

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,450
so you can click them which link you to

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:59,070
helpful django pages like the the

00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:01,140
dashboard and helpful timeline some some

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,490
data analysis on the Django ticket

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,980
system and so on and that's it if you

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,500
can please please join us at the sprints

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,240

going to work on the big async thing I

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,429
am very unhappy with the state of the

00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,409
