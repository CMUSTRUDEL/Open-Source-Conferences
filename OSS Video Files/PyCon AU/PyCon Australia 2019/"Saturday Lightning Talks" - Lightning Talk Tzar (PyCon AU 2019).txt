	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
and now we have lightning talks talks

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,839
that you could fit in a tweet but let's

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,280
give you five minutes instead and with

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,730
that I'll hand over to our lightning

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:16,230
talks our Christopher neugebauer he was

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:21,600
just up here Oh Veronica are you in the

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:31,410
room Veronica put your hand up if you

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:33,989
hear veronica heinous here oh okay I'll

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:40,739
put it later on Sam Bishop are you in

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:44,489
here put your hand up wonderful okay so

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,379
now we can probably make a start it's

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,840
lightning talks time hurray this is my

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,510
at least second favourite bit of pike on

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,699
Australia can we having a round of

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,070
applause stop okay I need to train you

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,590
so lightning talks they are five minutes

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,480
talks that can be on any topic a

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,610
presenter wants to talk about that can

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,310
be about Python it might not be about

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,780
Python we don't have a whole lot of time

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,640
to get through these so I'm gonna spend

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,590
as little time on stage as possible

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,360
hopefully just handy between our two

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,909
presenters so when I say somebody is on

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,560
deck you should come up and set up your

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,200
your laptop so you're plugged in and

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,390
ready to go when the next presenter or

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,820
your previous presenter finishes and

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,350
also to make sure that we don't use up

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,900
too much time we need to keep our

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,210
applauses nice and sharp and short so

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,979
I'm going to help you stop applauding

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:44,670
everybody please applaud stop so good

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,000
okay we also only have five minutes per

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,170
talk and we want to help people know

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,149
that their time is about to run out

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,000
without drowning them out by applause

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:59,369
and we do that by applauding with our

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,079
index fingers together we can just don't

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,329
hear that if more of us do that maybe

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,409
everybody could hear it wonderful and

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,000
we'll start doing that about five

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,590
seconds before the talk finishes and

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,599
then start into a wonderful round of

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,410
applause and then stop great okay I

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,270
think

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,130
salmon's set up now so we are going to

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,140
start with Sam Bishop who is going to

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,140
talk about computational world building

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,030
green most of us at some point of

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,610
thought about making a game it seems to

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,640
be almost universal that programming

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,080
leads to tinkering which leads to

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,150
various experiments like trying to make

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,460
little games along the way most of us

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,580
trip over procedural generation I

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,960
tripped over it fairly hard recently not

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,240
because I was trying to make a game

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,300
because I started looking into trying to

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,720
write more and as part of the process of

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,700
developing fiction I went down a bit of

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,240
a rabbit hole and effectively nerds not

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,070
to myself python is really good for this

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,980
kind of thing because you can use it

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,020
very flexibly to do lots of repeated

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,600
little things and generating procedural

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,490
content is like that so there's actually

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,310
a lot of really good examples of using

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,930
Python to do generation of things and it

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,480
gets more complex as you look into these

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,340
things as well including things like a

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,640
spaceship generator that automatically

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,530
generates them in blender for you and

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,440
tools like this which is a Python

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,090
powered noodle editing system in blender

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
to allow you to build up objects

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,040
procedurally as segments and computation

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,490
we construct them and right up to

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,709
planets which I'll give a demo of here

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,760
in case and that blenders giving me

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,150
grief but we'll see if it actually

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,150
renders

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,680
and that's actually being rendered as a

00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,690
real-time shader using blender which is

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,810
in case you don't know built with Python

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,610
and scriptable with Python so even if

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,580
this is actually using some of blenders

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,810
other parts I can dump that texture and

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,120
use it for something else that I might

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,320
want to do like for instance I might

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,600
want to work out what the climate of

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,980
this world might be like and it turns

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,910
out there's good Python libraries for

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,100
doing that as well

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,350
there's Eska which is a computational

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,550
model for building global circulation of

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,040
planetary atmospheres it's all in the

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,020
blurb and they've got some lovely

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
diagrams here of what you can do with it

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,500
including defining a little terrain

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,690
section that you can see there with a

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,550
big square blocks or the weird-looking

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,110
continents on the right there and then

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,870
it'll generate what the actual climates

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,010
like across the planet and so as I keep

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,780
going down this thing I start

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,900
experimenting with building planets and

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,690
so I'm building physics and building

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,200
equations it's turning into a weird pile

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,270
of physics and math and then I trip over

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,880
an article that thoroughly snipes me

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,330
there is this article by an actual

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,390
planetary scientist he does do celestial

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,610
mechanics for a living and he was

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,470
writing about how many worlds you could

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,090
fit in a solar system and then he found

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,590
a 30 year old research paper

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,090
he's mapped himself a little bit there

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,210
but I think it might have hit me in the

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,270
recoil because after discovering this

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,770
and then his follow-on which was how he

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,690
managed to put nine stars and about a

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,740
million earth sized planets inside the

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,080
one solar system

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,419
I was a little hooked on the concept and

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,189
so I started trying to work out what it

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,020
might be like and

00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,340
as you do I've got a piece of software

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,919
that'll tell me what a planet is like

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,300
and it needs some inputs so I start

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,520
trying to generate those inputs which

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,020
means I need to work out how much light

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,729
is going to land on there so I start

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,500
working out okay where am I stars gonna

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,090
be and then after I've worked out where

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,620
my stars are gonna be I'll work out

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,090
where they're radiating patterns are and

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,199
their shadows and I'm doing the math and

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:02,129
I'm doing the 1/2 and I'm doing the math

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:05,280
and then it doesn't work and it doesn't

00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,110
work quite impressively because let's

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,280
see if no vision number 7 has finished

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:14,400
rendering no it looks like 7 yep 7 has

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,830
failed on me as well so the 7th version

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,440
does work the one you saw there was 8

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,509
this is using 8 stars and for some

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,460
reason this doesn't work but it does

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:26,669
work for even numbers if numpy doesn't

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,909
give me grief and then it goes on

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:33,300
further with these things because this

00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:36,659
actually took i'll find the number here

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,139
for this one the hard part of this took

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:42,300
a where are my timing markers oh it's

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:47,029
removed my x well I actually let that

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,469
one run overnight on a cloud server

00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:52,139
because apparently computers aren't very

00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:53,159
good at abstract numbers they're great

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,229
when you have a number that actually

00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,180
means something not so much when you

00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,389
have a number that could mean anything

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,210
and so this sort of thing takes a much

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,500
longer time for the computer to work out

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,940
which was fairly surprising to me

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,860
because I can do algebra on a piece of

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,099
paper faster than some of these things

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,680
can but I definitely wouldn't want to be

00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,610
doing trigonometry like that I know

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,610
where my limit lies

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:27,430
is that the end yeah wonderful thank you

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,530
spamming okay is Genevieve Buckley in

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,890
the room wonderful

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,900
great so for our coming up I got future

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,910
presenters if you have dongles for your

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,800
for your laptop if you can bring those

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,690
up on stage we do have some spares but

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,500
we like don't want them to go running

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,360
around too far so before Genevieve we

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,770
have veronika who is going to talk about

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,420
code comments all right I hear one

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,100
person say yes that's exciting to me

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,350
okay so we're going to do this really

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,120
fast how many of you all have written

00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,090
comment to yourselves like within your

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,070
code oh my god I'm in the right room yes

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,540
okay so there's lots of reasons to do

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,770
that we could spend time on that but we

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,270
won't and instead I'm going to tell you

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,520
so when you wrote that comment in your

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,600
code did you think that what you were

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:21,600
writing was documentation yeah no looks

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,160
like no okay so as you can see

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,830
documentation plays an important role in

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,930
the usability of our code and it's

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,550
fairly important and I would like to

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,160
challenge us all to start thinking of

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,410
those inline comments as their own form

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,360
of documentation so comets as Doc's have

00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,500
different benefits than these long for

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,140
Bri means that we think of as

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,550
documentation they may give a wife or a

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,250
decision they're lowering our cognitive

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,740
load they're describing our functions in

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,270
place perhaps and so with all these good

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,380
good things like comments do you may

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,140
think that we'd be throwing them

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,630
everywhere and but what's the problem

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,150
with that yeah all this is actually true

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,850
so the testing may point us to outdated

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,190
comments but there's nothing that I've

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,260
found keep these comments up-to-date so

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,710
these commas do point to unclear code

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,740
and given that if these comments mislead

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:14,710
this comic takes on an even more

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,850
important role in what we think of as

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,350
comments but with write the docs on one

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,390
side of our shoulder and keep it dry on

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,890
the other it's kind of hard to decide

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,600
what to do so we're going to look at

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,500
some ugly code that I wrote with some

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,270
ugly comments get excited and so here I

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,980
said at the top of the doc hey

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,870
may I used a tutorial to do this it's

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,730
kind of important that you know that I

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,350
didn't start out with this code but here

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,070
things got a little more complicated in

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:44,140
this second example I wanted a little

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,360
notification to pop up when a climbing

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,710
wall near was me was open so I used

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,210
beautifulsoup and that was lovely but

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,560
I'd never used beautifulsoup before so

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,540
every time I got confused I wrote myself

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,940
a comment I save code that I should have

00:09:52,540 --> 00:10:03,490
saved and I wrote my favorite comment to

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:05,080
date oh it's a list thank God so very

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,060
complicated relationship with comments

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,980
there are some best practices we can

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,900
agree on we all know that outdated

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,120
comments come in the form of filthy

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,980
dirty lies there are some things that we

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,980
have a little more contention about and

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,200
all this confusion means that we sit

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,970
here and we make ourselves memes you

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,310
know when you're when you feel strongly

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,260
about something you make a meme right so

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,620
like maybe comments are a waste of time

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:32,410
labeling cats or maybe you know the only

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,300
bad code is the uncommented code that

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,340
won't be useful in the future now of

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,710
course the Internet has a lot of really

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,330
helpful advice we could refractor we

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:45,460
could just code better the bottom line

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,920
the internet tells us is only our code

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,510
matters now I don't know what this

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,400
sounds like to you but it sounds a lot

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,500
like to me like there's a screaming a

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,190
squirrel telling you that you must stop

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,020
but not telling you what to do and said

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,030
that's what it sounds like to me so as

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,790
we know we have some advice coming to

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,010
our way and you know when I look at that

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,110
I hear the only way the way you learn is

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,880
an anti-pattern and you see on the

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,250
internet a whole lot this is from Stack

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,230
Overflow lo and behold people ask really

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,790
thoughtful questions oh I'm in this

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,500
situation I'm trying to comment I'm

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,630
thinking about this way and they get

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,240
really helpful answers like this this

00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:26,770
has been discussed to death you know go

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,440
to this blog post that I wrote and you

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,330
know when I when I hear that I don't

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,460
know what you hear but I hear your

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,940
struggle bores me and you are a bad

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,530
programmer ok thanks bye

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,060
and so if we can go back and remember

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,030
the our first comments we can remember

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,780
that they're magic they're a lifeline

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,470
they

00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:50,500
really help beginning programmers and

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,210
programmers at all levels so I've seen

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,850
especially with new programmers use

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,320
comments in a lot of different ways and

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,510
I want us to remember as we're

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,300
evaluating what how commas should be

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,390
used that a lot of us are in that

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,650
position I committed a lot of stuff to

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,510
get I really don't know what I did

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,030
tonight I really need some more comments

00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,680
in my life we're gonna skip this slide

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,070
because the story isn't as important as

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,720
the time so I started asking everybody

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,270
about Co comments and I tried asking

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,130
Twitter and you know a whole six people

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,650
responded to me because I have such good

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,390
following there and I said wait a minute

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,920
that doesn't give me very much data I'm

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,810
so sad about this but apparently there's

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,390
about a 50/50 split among those nine

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,320
people so let's ask do a real survey and

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,180
ask more questions

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,640
so there are my questions from the real

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,000
survey which we will not go through

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:43,540
today because that's how life is um and

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,790
so I asked okay we're gonna go real fast

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,530
so a lot of people feel positively about

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,720
comments in the following ways but when

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,660
we get to the point where I have to ask

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,339
hey Cody's self-documenting they say

00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:01,260
this thanks Veronica

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:04,480
sorry we're really strict on time here

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,240
okay William Brown you are on deck but

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,630
first this is Genevieve she's okay she's

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,910
going to write Python the lumberjack way

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:17,760
thank you yeah we're logging get it

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,050
so slides are up here code examples take

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
a picture if you want we're moving on

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,350
pretty fast

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,870
my name is Genevieve I'm a scientific

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,930
program I work we're doing data science

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,150
for biomedical research applications and

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,980
if you get super inspired by this guide

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,020
for the extremely short guide for the

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,580
bewildered and the befuddled you can

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,680
check out some of these more advanced

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,220
tutorials or get your feet wet in a more

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,930
of a bit of a better way but this is for

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,360
you if you have never loved things

00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,090
before why would we want to do that

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,480
logging is part of the standard library

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:54,270
so it's super easy super useful you can

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,830
check out the docs here and there's a

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,150
number of advantages of using logging

00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,040
instead of just littering your code with

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,740
print statements this is particularly

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,990
important in cases where say I do write

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,550
a script or a program an application and

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,670
I need actually then give it to someone

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:12,450
else some users to use I ran into oh

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:15,540
gosh IG problems I ran into a friend of

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,790
mine on the bus what the day I came to

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,350
PyCon and he told me that actually he's

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:25,370
written some Python scripts being run by

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,600
can we get AI IV help over here

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,150
he's written some scripts they're being

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,310
run by some some people that he knows

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,050
and it's not working so well for him

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,110
they told him that in about ten percent

00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,450
of the cases it's it's broken and how

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,030
long has this been happening maybe a

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,960
couple of months that's not something I

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,120
want to debug especially not with logs

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,860
so there are a number of advantages we

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,960
can have over printing you can look to

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,540
the file to file as well as terminal

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,130
simultaneously you can easily change how

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,080
they base the output is with just a

00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,490
single line rather than having to redo

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,730
all of your print statements through the

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,680
code and if you log the user input as

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,420
well as the exceptions and the stack

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,000
traces you can reproduce those issues

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,750
later so that's really critical for me

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,260
so how can we use it just real quick to

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,750
have a look at an example so we can use

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,150
Logging's basic config to set set our

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,500
logger up here we can see that there's

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,140
basically three lines to it there's

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,400
format and so my logging messages will

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,290
have a timestamp they will have the

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,490
priority level of the message and then

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,910
they'll have the message like what I

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,950
want to convey at that point the level

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,730
we have next is setting the priority

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,350
level for the DES logo so debug is maybe

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,410
our most generous level we're gonna see

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,510
everything that has a login call and

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,250
then the handler that i've set here is a

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,720
stream handler that just means i want

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,320
everything just print it out to my

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,310
terminal when i run this so if we then

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,440
have a little look at that so here this

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,670
is where we would maybe take some things

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,740
that might be originally print

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,540
statements and instead write logging to

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,910
infer some useful information here

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,150
logging don't warn that's a stone

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,700
warning not to do that and we can see

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:17,660
them being output to terminal at the

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:20,420
moment if i want to make my logging like

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,370
less aggressive i only want to be told

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,870
about warnings and above really critical

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,900
messages i can do that with a single

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,200
line change and just set that priority

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,570
level so now we see that everything that

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,790
is unimportant in this use case is just

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,370
being ignored and we're happy with that

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,530
so that's nice but we really kind of

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,630
want like records of this so we want to

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,700
log to the file and the terminal

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,010
simultaneously and that's also super

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,140
easy it's just a one-line change we can

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,700
see in the handlers list we have our

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,950
stream handler like before but now i've

00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,740
added a file handler as well so it's

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,890
that logging output will also go to the

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,540
the file name that i've specified here

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:03,410
so let's run something similar again

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:07,580
have some nice messages okay that's cool

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:11,390
but what's in the file we can see so by

00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:13,310
default logging will append to the file

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,589
but if you don't like that you can

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,959
change it with file mode and if you want

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,640
to log different priority levels to the

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,770
terminal verses to your file you can

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,850
also do that there's a good example in

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:28,490
the cookbook so logging exceptions is

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,560
hugely hugely useful you would do that

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,540
something like this kind of syntax if

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,010
you use the logging dot exception you

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,560
will automatically get useful

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,410
information there it's equivalent to log

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,680
in to arrow with an exit info equal to

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,090
true

00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,590
but if we want to log uncaught

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,560
exceptions you can do kind of hacky

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,860
things and connect a handler to sis

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,020
except hook that won't work well in the

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,930
Jupiter notebook that I have going here

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,390
but that's a fun fun kind of thing to do

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,000
this isn't an excuse not to raise and

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,650
handle your exceptions properly mind but

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,790
when things go wrong and unanticipated

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:16,050
ways we really want to know cool so

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:19,900
thank you very much thank you Genevieve

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,820
so when we put up the call for lightning

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,490

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,190
didn't have to be about Python William

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,390
has given me a real so on deck Rowena

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,220
Stewart on this side

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,440
William has given me a really

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:40,600
descriptive title here it says history

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:42,400
and politics thanks Chris I'm here to

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,140
talk to you today about history and

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,370
politics of Australian New Zealand

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,400
supermarkets and their subsequent

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:52,210
murders and rebrandings this is

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Australia and this is New Zealand now we

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,350
have supermarkets in both of these

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Australia has a duopoly with a couple of

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,160
small independence and New Zealand has a

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,350
few major brands of its own how we got

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,890
here is a journey that takes us over 105

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,390
years of history 1914 Cole's is found in

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,720

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,340
Foursquare branding on all their members

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,830
stores something unprecedented at the

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,360
time well first us Wellington saw the

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,310
success and said we'll make another one

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
which is independent to the Auckland

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,700

South Wales and it was named this

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,040
because they are worried about issues

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,570
with American companies invading but

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,400
when finding out that America was not

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,750
going to avert invade they called

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,820

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,230
array so what does the sense hat sense

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:14,850
humidity barometric pressure temperature

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,580
acceleration orientation and magnetic

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,790
fields all in one chip and it's got a

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,740
joystick play input but not everyone can

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,480
afford a brass pre-play let alone one

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,040
with the sense hat on it since how it

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,860
costing almost as much as the play

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,290
itself thankfully there's an emulator on

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,720
a website called trinket dot IO but also

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,240
with a 3d module that you can drag her

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,210
out and kids usually spend the first few

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,190
minutes of the lesson doing exactly that

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,050
you can use the manual and the sliders

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,030
at the top to manually change the sensor

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,840
values and you control the joystick with

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,240
the arrow keys of your keyboard

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,020
on to making rainbows which is the title

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,450
of my talk

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,800
first we define each of the colors of

00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,890
the rainbow using an array it's a night

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,960
repellent igb array and it's great for

00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:06,200
teaching kids about how computers

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,900
represent collars next step is to

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,650
compose the 64 value array to represent

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:15,680
what color to make each led on the in

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:18,140
the array on the actual board and then

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:25,570
we use a set pixels function to actually

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:25,570
turn the lights on like this all of this

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,810
so the next step is to get some data out

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,320
of the senses for this we'll only be

00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:42,410
using the humidity and the temperature

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,260
sensors so we say if it's high humidity

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,840
which we define it's over 80% and high

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,990
temperature which we define is over 20%

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,930
I mean 20 degrees Celsius we show the

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,390
rainbow if it's humid and cold we get

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,010
snow if it's hot but not so humid we get

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,590
sunshine so this is also great for

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:07,270
teaching kids about science and the

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:09,800
environment you'll see on the blind 7

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,020
we're passing a value into sense not

00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,300
clear this is really counterintuitive

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,510
because you're trying to like don't let

00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:21,140
clear the screen so what this does is it

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,850
makes all the LEDs that one color if you

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:27,080
don't pass it any values like on the

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:28,760
last one it clears the screen so why

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,160
don't we see what the conditions are

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,810
like in the room today particularly this

00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:38,260
area of the stage so I could scroll text

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:44,450
that's temperature 26 degrees Celsius

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:45,050
and then humidity 40% so falling back

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,270
hard

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:51,380
we should get sunshine

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,380
[Music]

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,899
so that's didn't talk more or less code

00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,229
clubs really fun to do you should all do

00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,769
it

00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:04,359
there is a map on our website on the

00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:06,999
code club website to find the nearest

00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:10,659
club so you can do more cool things with

00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:12,969
sense hats and Python Python you can

00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:16,059
start your own Club there's also online

00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:17,889
training for volunteers I will have this

00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,809
with me tomorrow if Rena wants to ask me

00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:28,989
about it or have a look at it

00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:31,419
and thank you for listening Gavin Smith

00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:33,159
you're on deck on this side but first we

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:37,149
have Damien George who's going to talk

00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,749
about fermions that's right yes hi

00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,449
everyone

00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:42,819
so I'm Damien George I'm the creator of

00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:44,619
micro Python you may have seen me talk

00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:46,149
before but I'm not talking about micro

00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:48,399
burthen today I'm not even talking about

00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:51,039
Python I couldn't connect this to talk

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,069
to Python in any way sorry I'm going to

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,139
talk about elementary particles so in a

00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:59,259
past life I was a theoretical physicist

00:28:56,139 --> 00:29:02,049
and I worked on the standard model and

00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:05,019
the Higgs boson and some string theory

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:06,519
related physics which is all very

00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:08,259
interesting although python is a little

00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,169
much much more interesting in that and

00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:12,369
what I'm today I just want to explain a

00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,429
little bit about the elementary

00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:16,659
particles of the universe if I think

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,309
they're very interesting so this is a

00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,839
periodic table of the elements which is

00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,749
what most people think of elementary

00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,889
hints the named elements so everything

00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:27,669
in the world is made up of these

00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:29,679
elements but these themselves are

00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:33,069
hydrogen helium and so on are made up of

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,889
other things more elementary and this

00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:38,319
periodic table here is the layout of the

00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,629
table is actually important and you can

00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,979
derive the layout of this table by doing

00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:44,019
some physics like solving the

00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:45,789
Schrodinger equation and what I'm going

00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:48,399
to try and explain is what these

00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,199
particles are made of and how you create

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,499
a periodic table of the more elementary

00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:56,229
particles so there are two kinds of

00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:57,519
elementary particles fermions which is I

00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:00,989
have written that their way around

00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,830
fermions are the hard thing like would

00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:06,190
and bosons of the

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,950
soft thing like light and gravity and

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,169
they're the two basic elementary things

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,019
and everything is made up of them and

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:16,809
usually you can see a picture of these

00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:18,700
like this if you google us the standard

00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:21,250
model or something you'll come up with a

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,960
picture like this which has the fermions

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,450
on the Left which is the green in the

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,750
purple and the bosons on the right so on

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,090
the right there's the glue on the Higgs

00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,799
particle which was recently found the

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,929
photon which is light what everyone

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,909
knows about in the W in the Z and the

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:40,960
bottom is four therefore nuclear decay

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:42,760
and on the Left electrons neutrinos up

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,720
and down quarks is what everything is

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,820
made of now the the key here is that you

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,610
can arrange these particles in certain

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,950
ways like the periodic table of hydrogen

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,620
helium and so on so that you can more

00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,450
easily kind of understand the structure

00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,830
of the well the structure of the

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,350
universe the structure of the elementary

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:05,080
particles of the universe so this is a

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,070
plot that I made for my PhD thesis a

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,960
while ago and it shows the charges of

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,450
the fermions of all the hard things that

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,659
everything's made up of in a in a neat

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,460
diagram so you can think of this like

00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:22,630
the periodic table but for the quarks

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,090
and the electrons and neutrinos so I'll

00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,679
try and explain it a little bit in on

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,019
the left-hand side let's start with the

00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,850
electrons so the electron is actually

00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:34,659
made up of a left-handed part and a

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:36,970
right-handed part al and ER but they are

00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,010
actually separate things to begin with

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,460
so the right-handed part of the electron

00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,049
is known as a singlet i'm the su 2 and

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,960
the left-handed electron is part of a

00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:48,190
doublet with the left-handed neutrino

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,000
now what happens

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:54,340
so the right-handed electron is has

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,610
charged minus 2 on this axis which is

00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,830
the UN Y symmetry and the left-handed

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,450
doublet here as a charge minus 1 so that

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,389
that's why this is a picture of charges

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:08,470
and why things are arranged as they are

00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:11,169
now to get to reality the Higgs boson

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,940
comes along and it breaks the symmetries

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:15,429
that you see here it breaks the U one in

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,720
the su 2 and it mixes them together and

00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:18,520
it takes a linear combination

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,130
of them so what you're supposed to do is

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,230
then a look at this picture from a slant

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,200
now the Higgs is like you don't want to

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,890
go that way you want to go this way so

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,270
yeah if you slant to the left like that

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,039
that's the way you should see it and so

00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,230
what it does is it mixes things together

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,240
so the left and the right-handed

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,640
components get mixed together here and

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,860
you see the electron in real life so

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,080
looking in that direction there along

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,940
that line you see the true electron

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,559
which is now has mass because of the

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,559
Higgs and because of this mixing in this

00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,179
angle and it has charge minus one we

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,150
know the electron is charged minus one

00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:58,240
as in it's negative and so you've got to

00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,700
look along diagonally so minus one is

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,350
down here and the positron has a plus

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,780
one charge which is on the other side

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,690
and in the middle along this line is

00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,370
zero electric charge which is the

00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,530
neutrino so the neutrino is charged less

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,710
and the up and down quarks have plus

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:16,030
two-thirds plus one-third and so on

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:18,010
these little three dots mean they're

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,620
charged under QCD color so they can bind

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,600
together to form our nucleus so two ups

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,809
and a down make a proton which has

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,970
charge plus one and sorry two downs and

00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,380
one up make a neutron which has no

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,760
charge so you can do the math to see

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,760
that thank you

00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:43,500
oh yeah I I drifted off that was it

00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:47,970
Woolworths who acquired them ah yeah

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,340
okay yeah always forget about them Jason

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:54,600
and Jan koum oh you're on this side but

00:33:50,340 --> 00:34:00,450
first Gavin Smith who is trying to make

00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:05,370
a machine go ping apparently okay g'day

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,810
I'm Gavin ie in my spare time I hope run

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,250
the robots and dinosaurs make space in

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,770
Meadowbank I'd like to talk to you about

00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,330
robots that make things for you and tell

00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,040
you where you can find robots that makes

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,780
things for you and some tips about how

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,630
to make the robots make the things that

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,530
you want most effectively so to start

00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:25,590
with we are living in the future rapid

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,550
prototyping is a thing what exactly is

00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,760
it

00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,860
it's robots the big things for you so to

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,889
give a simple example of this laser

00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,600
cutter it's a robot it moves the laser

00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,179
cuts and engrave some material for you

00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,169
another example of rapid prototyping is

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,879
3d printing

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:43,830
you robot artfully moves plastic nozzle

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,480
lovingly spews the plastic onto a

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,700
surface for you in a shape that you've

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,470
requested if you're very lucky it

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,940
matches what you actually fit into the

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:55,560
machine CNC machining remove a robot

00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,320
moves a spinning drill bit removing bits

00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,670
of wood that you don't want anymore

00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,560
these are essentially the three main

00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:05,310
ways of getting rapid prototyping

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,350
working that's great but where do you

00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,940
get access to these things not many

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,490
people can own their own laser cutter

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,600
and 3d printer and CNC machine I did

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,440
previously but I don't anymore

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,080
so because makerspaces so rapid

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,590
prototyping expensive kind of only a

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,160
pretty good

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,780
we can't own every machine ourselves

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,550
luckily make spaces our thing find one

00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,320
in your city what are they they are a

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,390
community of people that like making

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,690
stuff what sort of stuff just techie

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,430
stuff no no anything we've got people

00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,110
that do glass work electronics laser

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,030
cutting sewing woodwork programming

00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,210
casting etc they're definitely not just

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,370
traditional tech stuff and it's if

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,800
you've ever like puzzled on a problem

00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,100
and and spent a day trying to figure out

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,180
how to do it and you

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,610
to be around a bunch of other people

00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,080
that also spent time pounding their

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,750
heads against problem this is the place

00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,670
to go first I'm physical make space

00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,190
please watch out for what I call the we

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,390
are not worthy effect so people walk

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,560
into a mix base and they see someone

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,730
doing woodworking they see someone doing

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,690
electronics they see some dude casting

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,700
let's see someone do this and they go oh

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,010
my god I ain't know how to do one or two

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,020
of those things I'm not the person who

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,340
belongs here but if you walked into a

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,750
library you wouldn't see someone with a

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,330
book on Greek literature and a book on

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,950
art and someone studying surgery and

00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,270
that and think oh my god these people

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,130
know how to do all of those things so

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,300
they know one person does everything so

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,070
just watch out for the we're not worthy

00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,980
effect it's it's really really subtle

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,690
and yeah anyway see you some practical

00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,830
suggestions I make space a thing go find

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,300
a makerspace here's a practical

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,120
suggestions for what to actually do with

00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,950
them in my humble opinion laser cutting

00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,990
if available always beats 3d printing

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,400
you get a result in ten minutes versus

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,280
four hours there's way less freaking of

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,990
temperatures and makes a machine it

00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,490
allows you to make mistakes so much

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,770
faster no design ever works perfectly on

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,250
the first go it needs one two three

00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,560
times to get it worked out if you've got

00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,690
a laser cutter you can get it out faster

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,360
here's a few bits and pieces that I put

00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,700
together just in a few hours it's it's

00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,580
very very some it's very very satisfying

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,070
to have a concept and then go to actual

00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,750
thing in a short amount of time I'm

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,940
running short time Python there are

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,200
Pythian generators for SVG's and stls

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,850
that's four laser cutters and 3d

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,960
printers is that the most dominant file

00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,050
for each of those respectively

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,360
also everyone uses jupiter matplotlib

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,950
yeah yep you can make map problems save

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,320
a plot as SVG and then throw it directly

00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:29,020
into a laser with maybe one or two

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,180
minutes of coddling in Inkscape first as

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,520
a quick example of that he is sorting

00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,410
out friends thread collection has far

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,200
too many fabric.you things just in terms

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,080
of storage space this is our way of

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,600
imposing organization on that that's

00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,460
know please like you've now got first

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,230
order access you can see all the stuff

00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,400
and you can grab it in one go whereas

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,450
before it would have taken you ten

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,070
minutes to figure out whether you've got

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,730
it or not

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:57,310
a second example just real quick fine

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,930
and spiral finally the his intro to

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,310
quantum mechanics and use a double

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,970
cities in example and I'm reading this

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,920
any

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:07,330
he basically explains in lecture why the

00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,530
2d graphs don't work and you need for QM

00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,820
you need to use complex numbers and not

00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,230
real numbers and blah blah blah and he

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,260
just showed equations but he never did

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,190
the actual plot and I'm like oh and I'm

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,960
grooving around no one else has done

00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,760
like the 3d plot yet I'm like okay I

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,890
need to do this make a chip a notebook

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,040
boom here's the thing and then very

00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,710
happy but I want a tangible version for

00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,240
my coffee table goddammit so I modify

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,380
the Jupiter notebook to make SVG's for

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,500
laser cutting there's a whole bunch of

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,390
little squares there glueck stack paint

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,170
I now have a coffee table thing of

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,630
define and spiral ready to go make

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,700
SpaceX next is new you sydney robots and

00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,340
dinosaurs Medibank first one there

00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,130
canberra make void Milburn CCHS Perth

00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,460
Ida factory Tasmania Hobart hack space

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,460
there are others

00:38:53,670 --> 00:39:01,810
okay Bianca Gibson you're up on deck on

00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:06,660
this side but first Jason Zhang como is

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,660
going to show us more Greek apparently

00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:17,140
yeah what yeah this is it

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,790
okay hello I'm Jason Turner from the

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,290
Australian Council of trade unions I'm a

00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,680
software developer there and I'm going

00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,090
to talk about model repos so there's a

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,510
bet talk from the one that I'm about to

00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:30,700
do and it's by Rachel from Google and it

00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,310
kind of goes into the benefits pros and

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,710
cons that they have with the Google mono

00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,740
repo and I guess when I first watched

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:41,650
that talk I really lacked all the pros

00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,060
and all a lot of the cons kind of only

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,450
really seemed like they would affect you

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:48,490
because they have giant giant code bases

00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,580
and and like all the places where I've

00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,720
worked have been a bit smaller and so

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,570
didn't really have that kind of those

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,040
kinds of issues so I'm just gonna go

00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,700
through like a common scenario that you

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,350
have with like multi repo workplaces so

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,570
like your company wants to build this

00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,910
app it's called app' so they create a

00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,620
new repo and then app' has a feature

00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,650
that is similar to their other app

00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,060
called APO and so they're like well

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,350
let's reuse that code so we they

00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,450
refactor a piyo

00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:19,480
to remove as much of the code to do with

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:23,140
that and they put it into a third repo

00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,540
called feature X and then they import

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,640
that into both app and app to IO so now

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,350
there's like three robos you can't see

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,210
like has everyone had that kind of

00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,540
situation at their workplace raise your

00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,520
hand

00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,400
no no yeah yeah okay cool it's not just

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,050
me now this is this is where the issue

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,980
comes in is when you try and make a

00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:45,160
change so if I want to make a change for

00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,690
app app dot IO and that requires me to

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,280
change feature X I need to make a new

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,960
branch and feature X and new branch and

00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,630
app dot IO and then I make the relevant

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,940
changes into feature X and do a pull

00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,130
request into feature X in the meantime I

00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,340
update the ret reference to feature X in

00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,810
app today o make the changes that I need

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,010
to do and then do a PR there then I go

00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:08,170
back to the other PR note and then

00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,400
I get comments on that PA it looks fine

00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,760
to get approved but then I need to wait

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,110
for the other PR to get merged but then

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,640
the issue is that someone comments that

00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,290
PR and then I make changes so I make

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,940
changes push them and then I got to go

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:24,220
and update the app dot IO PR push

00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,250
changes to that then get the other PR

00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,710
merged then go and update it again

00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,300
because obviously before it was pointing

00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,520
not to masters pointing to what if my PR

00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,350
branch was and now you need make it

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,150
change tomorrow I'm gonna get update it

00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,410
again and then usually that means that

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,980
anyone who reviewed it has to review it

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:43,600
again and it's just bloody awful and

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,320
then and then there's this last bit at

00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,460
the end where obviously a per which was

00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,310
the original app where the feature came

00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,850
from I'm not really changing that up at

00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,560
the moment

00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,020
but I've just changed something that

00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,030
that depends on and so if I'm really

00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,070
nice I'll go go through and update it

00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,380
and make sure it works or if I'm not

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,150
then I'll just leave it and then the

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,220
next developer who comes to update it

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,020
will then like have this code that

00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,350
doesn't work and then we'll have to fix

00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,500
all my issues that I just introduced any

00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,780
hands of if that's ever happened to you

00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,840
yeah it sucks

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:23,080
now if we had everything in the one repo

00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,900
all I need to do update feature X and

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:29,950
app that I owe and then when I push the

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,780
code it it would run the test for

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,210
anything that depends on feature X and

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,640
also on app that I owe and then you got

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:40,180
one PR one review one merge it's great

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,440
and so when I went to do this I'm not

00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,700
expecting you to read that code but just

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,310
write like a bit of a bash script to

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,380
pull in all our repos put them into one

00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,960
fault like into subfolders each with the

00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,620
name of the repo and then commit them

00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,890
and that link is the gist of it and it's

00:42:53,620 --> 00:43:00,070
crappy like batch code but you know it

00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:02,470
got it done then the issue is like your

00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,880
CI CD a lot of them are based on the

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:10,720
idea of you know one repo one build one

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,410
deploy pipeline and so I had some issues

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,820
there where like obviously before every

00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,200
time there's a commits the repo it will

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,360
build that repo but now you don't want

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,520
to build literally everything

00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,270
you do a commit so you've got to check

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,130
and see what files have changed and then

00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:31,300
determine which which tests to run and

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,500
which deploys to run and yeah that it

00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,620
can be a bit difficult but it can also

00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,780
be done some CI tools are better than

00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:42,070
others I found that with my particular

00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:44,740
CI tool that I won't name the current

00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:48,040
API it doesn't let you programmatically

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,300
trigger builds which means that we're

00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,170
gonna have to switch the eyes to get

00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,420
this working but then there's all this

00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,010
cool stuff that can happen so you remove

00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,160
those issues where there's fragmentation

00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,390
and different versions between projects

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,670
big three factors are easy you break

00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,310
down silos between teams and all the

00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:11,710
other stuff on the on the slides all

00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:13,480
right thank you everybody I actually

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:17,650
finished I had a joke lined up in

00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,960
everything terrible Jim massarde you are

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,000
up on deck but first

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:30,630
Bianca Gibson is going to tell us how to

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,980
become a 10x Rockstar developer sorry

00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,380
I've been a developer for a while but I

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,180
have only recently got to the point of

00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,330
becoming a 10x Rockstar developer while

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,890
right at this conference so the first

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,740
question that asks when trying to become

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:46,180
a 10x Rockstar developer might be you

00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,610
know what is one what is the Rockstar

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:51,220
developer well if a Python developer is

00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:53,200
the Dell developer the right spot in

00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,510
code and it makes sense that a rockstar

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,220
developer is a developer if it's the

00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,150
proc stockbroker I mean language and

00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:03,770
there is a rockstar programming language

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:14,400
[Laughter]

00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:15,960
Rockstar rocks is a computer programming

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,280
language designed for creating programs

00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,690
that are also here metal power ballots

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,260
and here is an implementation of

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:27,210
fizzbuzz but just going with the Fez

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,960
vault example doesn't get me to 10x

00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:34,470
Rockstar developer and I would I would

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,920
prefer to write it in a genre that I I

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,570
can also play to some extent like I can

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,400
play guitar for because then I'll be a

00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:47,520
more well-rounded rock star within that

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,830
area so I implemented something that

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,930
takes takes a number and multiplies it

00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:58,010
by ten that's ten times rock star

00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:59,720
and I wrote the lyrics to be idiomatic

00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,890
for one of the genres that I can play on

00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,570
guitar psychic ability because that

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,690
gives me a bit more range of themes to

00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:09,830
work with so idiomatic lyrics involve

00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:13,100
telling include tales of gargoyles

00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,570
attacking Copenhagen and haunting the

00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,520
home of your partner that murdered you

00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:18,050
are watching them while they try to

00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,180
sleep in keeping them awake

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:25,820
is there anything with undead eyes and

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:31,820
they creeped out Thank You Google a girl

00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:33,770
you're kissing a goal sorry

00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,230
Rockstar allows you to do quite a bit I

00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:38,480
can't remember if it's turing-complete

00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:40,280
but you can do a favorite so you can

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,720
define functions and do some operations

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:48,560
and yeah facilitates making them read

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,310
like lyrics so the first line undead

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,320
takes horror using it so undead is the

00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,820
name of a function and takes whatever

00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,530
come beliefs that comes out to take

00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:04,730
specifies the arguments so horror is an

00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:09,890
argument and then is is used for

00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:12,430
assignments and you can do you can you

00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,770
can use English work you can use words

00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:17,870
doesn't have to be English to provide

00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:21,710
the numbers so in this case zombie is

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:24,950
the variable name and then the true

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:28,310
words my girlfriend specify the number

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:34,310
so it uses two from the number of

00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:37,730
letters in my and then rides the num and

00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:43,340
each each word gives you a number which

00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:45,910
is trained together - yep create 20 in

00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,350
this case because it takes modulo ten of

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,650
girlfriends that comes out to zero and

00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:53,060
then but then I could have said zombie

00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,010
is a girlfriend but that doesn't make

00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,780
much sense so I'd say my so I just

00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,960
subtract 10 to it to actually get the

00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:05,300
number 10 so go see the silhouettes

00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:07,520
gives me 10 because I has one letter and

00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:11,150
so then I put zombie with

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,060
ghosts into hotrod specify gets gets me

00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,260
the number 10 it also specifies these

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,820
random guys that's hanging around

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,840
doesn't come for a ride out to wherever

00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:25,550
we're going and then give back hot rod

00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:27,910
of horror interpret that how you will is

00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,910
rock and roll

00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:37,480
and like it life is an apocalypse which

00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:41,510
in this case will give me 20 and to

00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,580
apocalypse 10 letters modulo 10 and then

00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,590
screen you can say scream or sale

00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,060
whisper for output since I'm talking

00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:50,060
about ghosts and zombies scream seems

00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:53,390
most appropriate sir I'm they're taking

00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:58,150
scream undead taking life it's been how

00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,150
he outputs the number 200

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,130
and if you'd like to learn Rockstar they

00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,329
have documentation in a language

00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:13,130
specification which you can go through

00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:16,700
and there's also a variety of

00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:18,140
implementations including a rock side of

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,470
pipe and transpiler that you could have

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,470
a go out

00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:30,709
now you too can be a 10x Rockstar

00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:36,229
developer he Dunham you are over here on

00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:37,819
this side I can only assume you're

00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:39,769
deeply confused at this point Jim

00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:45,949
because it says on this how does the

00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:48,079
moon work hi my name is Jim I'm a

00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,819
self-confessed space nerd but maybe not

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,029
quite as knowledgeable as I like to

00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:54,319
pretend I am is you'll discover fiftieth

00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:56,929
anniversary of the Apollo moon landings

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,269
very exciting time for my people to make

00:49:56,929 --> 00:50:00,199
this vaguely relevant to Python I

00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:01,789
discover that the Apollo guidance

00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,739
computer actually runs a virtual machine

00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:06,529
and so unfortunately not the Python

00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:09,439
bytecode so it was 1960 mid mid 1960s

00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:11,359
but it is a VM so there you go all right

00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,999
I would like you to please turn to the

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,219
person sitting next to you and in as if

00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:22,429
there were nine year old explain how you

00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:24,859
think the moon changes shape I haven't

00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:26,859
got long so be quick okay first first

00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:32,900
first thought that comes in your head

00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:37,279
okay stop stop stop all right did your

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:41,299
answer make sense do you know how the

00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:45,380
moon changes shape did your answer

00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:49,699
involve the word shadow can you explain

00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:53,420
this picture do you know why I'm asking

00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:56,929
you this does you when you say shadow

00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,429
does it involve the Earth's shadow just

00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,420
somebody want to admit to say it

00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:03,589
involves the Earth's shadow

00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:05,390
thank you it's somebody okay this came

00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:07,519
up because I was sitting next to the on

00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,859
the couch next to my soon-to-be wife and

00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,939
amazingly eventually wife and I said

00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,829
that's weird

00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:15,650
the moon's a funny shape considering the

00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:18,949
Sun just set on the horizon and she said

00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:20,809
what is wrong with you and I said how

00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:22,969
can the earth be casting a shadow on the

00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:25,489
moon when the Sun sorry the Sun mean

00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:27,229
when the Sun is just over there and she

00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:30,019
said what are you talking about

00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:33,679
and I said I don't know and she said

00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:34,910
what do you think in eclipses and then

00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:36,830
she said what is wrong with the

00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:41,060
education system in this country

00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:44,060
she is a New Zealand er okay I've

00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,530
prepared an animation they get more

00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:48,800
relevant to pipe than this this was ray

00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:51,530
traced in Python in the performance test

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,020
for micro Python which is used to test

00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:57,560
for new boards and you builds and it

00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,430
shows how the moon changes shape a lot

00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,480
of you are naughty head of course this

00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,960
is how the main changes shape what is

00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,760
wrong with you

00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,980
but for some people notice the earth

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,720
shadow is not involved the moon is a

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,240
ball in the sky sometimes it's lit and

00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,540
we see one part of some angle of the lit

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,540
side

00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,650
why isn't and it in Eclipse some people

00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,900
think that the moon has an eclipse every

00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,120
month it turns out the moon is on a five

00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,820
degree inclination from the ecliptic

00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,780
plane so most times the moon cannot even

00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,950
be possibly behind the Earth because

00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,480
because it's up thirty thousand

00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,870
kilometres higher than the earth and the

00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,760
ecliptic plane some people have

00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,140
discovered have all sorts of reasons for

00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,850
not knowing why the moon works the way

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,080
it does and my son unfortunately had

00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,450
this experience and that the first time

00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,300
he saw the moon it was an eclipse he was

00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,470
born on July 26 last year and the first

00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,970
time we were able to actually be

00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,500
somewhere where we could see the moon it

00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,570
was in the clips which I thought was

00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,650
pretty cool

00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:54,320
if you want to learn more about the Moon

00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:56,240
the Eclipse the lunar cycle and so forth

00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,100
I highly recommend wait I should be

00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,150
presenting these two videos from Matt

00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,130
Parker one of my favorite YouTube

00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,450
channels and then the bottom a cool

00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,070
video which is how you can learn to tell

00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,070
the time looking only at the moon I

00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,620
clearly learned nothing from this whole

00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,940
experience was only a few weeks ago were

00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,140
walking home and I saw the moon and

00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,750
there was a bright star next to the moon

00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,760
and my wife said to me I wonder which

00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,190
what that is that bright thing in the

00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,450
sky and I said given almost this exact

00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,430
picture and I said that must be Venus

00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,510
and she looked at me and said what is

00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:28,300
wrong with the education system in this

00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:28,300
country thank you very much

00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:40,530
so that does the moon does the moon work

00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:42,240
it works on the moon Oh see I would have

00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:46,470
thought it was a colles cuz of the logo

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,490
and all that but I have there's

00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:51,480
something wrong with the education

00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:54,660
system in this country so we have more

00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,570
lightning talks tomorrow signups for

00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,710
lightning talks will open sometime at

00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,150
the start of the day and we'll go

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,160
through until the end of morning T

00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:05,850
there'll be submission boxes at Reggio

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,530
or something like that but of course to

00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,630
have more lightning talks we need people

00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:13,470
to speak and emily is going to tell you

00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:15,630
why you should speak so I've been doing

00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:20,190
the speaking thing since 2014 and this

00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:22,440
is my 61st conference talk like no

00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,730
please stop thank you like every speaker

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,200
I've given some talks that I thought

00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,460
were great some that I hope to never

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,590
think about again and I've learned

00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,570
things from every single one do you

00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:34,530
think that you can't give even one

00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:37,440
conference talk if so I am here to tell

00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:40,140
you that you are wrong you should speak

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,120
why should you give a talk well you

00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,770
benefit from speaking because you make

00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,240
new friends you show off your work and

00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,440
you tell others about the changes that

00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,410
you want to see in the tech community

00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,630
your company benefits because your talk

00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,100
is good for its reputation your network

00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,960
that you'll build by speaking is good

00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,150
for its recruiting and it's named on

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,610
your badge is free advertising so tell

00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:01,170
them to help fund you if you need help

00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,910
getting to a conference and the

00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:05,100
conference benefits from your submission

00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,780
to speak even if you do not get accepted

00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,850
because when the papers committee has

00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,610
more options to choose from they can

00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:13,980
build a better program here's how to do

00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:15,180
it what you should say and where you

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,910
should say it are actually the same

00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,850
question the best talk for you to give

00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:23,280
is something that you know about and the

00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,290
conference needs and the audience wants

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,940
to hear if you find a topic that ticks

00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,070
all those boxes it might be a winner

00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,360
think about what you spend your time on

00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,880
and what you want other people to know

00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,140
about here's some free examples or if

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,180
you've got two interests that your

00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,740
average at both of you might be the most

00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,730
knowledgeable person in the whole world

00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,800
when it comes to come

00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,690
finding them so you've got some topic

00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,369
ideas find some conferences to attend

00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,960
consider dates locations themes the

00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:48,180
communities they build pick a few to

00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,220
apply for write a taut abstract that

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,510
gives context for your idea and asks the

00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,520
questions that your talk will answer

00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:55,200
submitted a lot and you'll get rejected

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,210
a lot but keep those rejections with

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,520
pride because every rejection is a time

00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,900
you dodged a bullet by denying or taught

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,520
the committee prevented you from

00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,560
speaking to an empty room or an

00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,830
uninterested audience so keep on

00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,990
applying and eventually you get accepted

00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,550
what have you signed up for but if your

00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:13,740
abstract asked a bunch of questions

00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,600
their answers are a premade outline for

00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,130
your talk arrange the answers to tell a

00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,930
story with the beginning a middle an end

00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,820
add context so the audience can

00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,770
understand and practice with a stopwatch

00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,810
to see how long it'll take if it's too

00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,640
short add more content if it's too long

00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:28,410
it cut something out then you got to

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,890
make slides don't be scared to draw them

00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,200
yourselves

00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,180
if xkcd you can draw stick figures and

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,690
become an icon of nerd culture you can

00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,160
draw a picture for a slide draw faces on

00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,690
stuff whether or not it's supposed to

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,820
have faces if you want the audience to

00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,290
imagine how it feels your audience has a

00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,940
bunch of human brains in it and most

00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:46,770
human brains have this huge thing for

00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,990
faces they're kind of weird that way so

00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,700
don't try not to just read text off of

00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,990
your slides if you can show pictures of

00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,970
what you mean because your slides are

00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,859
like this camera that documents what's

00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:58,080
in your head when you think about your

00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:59,910
topic if you need suggestions for how to

00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,670
communicate in pictures look at how the

00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:05,460
movies and TV and the art like comics do

00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,440
this all of them arrange these visual

00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,450
representations of concepts onto screens

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,250
just like you're going to try to so

00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,170
you've got content you've got slides no

00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,180
practice and get feedback if your

00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,560
friends want to help you they can listen

00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,390
to your rehearsals and tell you what

00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,650
they thought and make sure to listen to

00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:21,840
your own recordings even if your voice

00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:23,940
does sound really weird when you play it

00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,190
back so you get to the conference and

00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,650
you do the talk just like you practiced

00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:31,170
and then somebody asks you a question

00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:33,630
that you don't know the answer to yet

00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:35,580
this is terrifying because you think

00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,710
they'll find out how little you know and

00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,600
you just want to sneak away back to your

00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,160
room and just check the docs for the

00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,350
answer to that question that you know

00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:46,170
you should have remembered but that

00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:48,030
right there is your answer you tell them

00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:50,670
where you would look or who you would

00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,299
ask to answer what they ask you and this

00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,429
solves

00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:56,039
underlying problem which was that they

00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:58,679
didn't previously know how to find out

00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,539
so everybody who had the same questions

00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,339
as your abstract and came to your talk

00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:04,019
has learned something because you

00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:06,149
delivered on the promises that that

00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,619
abstract made the audience and the

00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,239
organizers are happy because they

00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:11,609
learned about the thing that you shared

00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:13,380
with them and the people who loved your

00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:15,089
talk will come tell you so and if

00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,309
anybody didn't love it they just won't

00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:20,039
say anything because they're polite so

00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:22,229
even if it did go so well everybody

00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:25,189
cheers for you at the end so you should

00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:25,189
speak hmm

00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:31,349
Thank You Emily

cool so if you are not a kangaroo you

00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:45,419
can also speak so if you're a stick

00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:47,069

00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:48,839
the end of our lightning talks can we

please have a round of applause for all

00:58:58,529 --> 00:59:02,659
delivered their first-ever conference

00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:02,659
talk

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,030
