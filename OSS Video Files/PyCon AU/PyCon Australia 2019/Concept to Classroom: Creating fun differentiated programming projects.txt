okay good afternoon everyone and welcome

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,910
back to the education track I expect

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,290
there may be a few people still making

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,500
their way in but we are going to start

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,800
we do want to stick to time so and next

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,210
presentation is by Rene noble now Rene

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
is the executive director of the girls

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,500
programming network and a software

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,720
developer at grok learning and having

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,369
had no exposure to programming until

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,410
stumbling upon it while studying at

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,480
Sydney Uni she was quick to add a CS

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,440
major to her chemical engineering and

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,570
chemistry pursuits now while a gpn renee

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,940
has taken what was a small site

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,350
operation to providing five hundred

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,989
girls a quarter with free programming

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,780
workshops all around Australia so there

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,140
are GP ends in Sydney Canberra Makai /

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,090
NWA and there are more on the way but to

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,969
talk a little bit more about how they

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,010
take concepts from ideas all the way

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:03,480
through to classroom activities I'm

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:16,439
going to hand over to Rene and and as

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:21,150
soon as she does that okay there we go

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,909
does that look pretty good excellent all

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,040
right so she was actually doing that

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,799
just to wait for our next group of

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,900
attendees that was beautifully done Rene

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,180
take it away

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,970
okay here we go thank you for coming to

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,320
my talk concept to classroom I'm gonna

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,630
tell you some things that I've learned

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,130
along the way about taking an idea to

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,930
something you can actually run with kids

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,000
in the classroom from the lessons I've

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,649
learned and you know the problems I've

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,420
encountered along the way in making my

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,700
own projects and the things that I've

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,770
seen other people make yeah feel free

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,189
there'll be a link to the slides on the

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,469
Twitter later yeah up there so yes I'm

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,240
Renee I'm a software engineer I'm an

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,640
educator and I like making communities

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,369
of people where people feel included and

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,810
excited about something I work for grukk

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,179
learning most of my time in the rest of

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,099
our time I spend running the girls

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,430
programming network and I'm also

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,030
supported by data 61 who helped me

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,099
have time to run gpn and pay rent yes so

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm gonna tell you about what we do at

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,540
gpn the girls programming network a lot

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,909
today we've run free programming

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,680
workshops for high school girls

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,689
predominantly and some of your talented

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,019
upper primary students and we're focused

00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,760
on an authentic programming experience

00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:37,280
it's all run by women and people of

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,200
gender diverse groups and we have a

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,730
whole range of students from complete

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,829
beginners to kids have been coming to

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,840
DPN for five or more years some of them

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,370
in the room right now

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,290
and we're really about creating a

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,819
program that eliminates barriers to

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,409
entry you don't need to know any

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,120
programming to come along you don't even

00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,739
need to know that you don't know any

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,419
programming to come along so you can

00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,579
come along and it's a full pipeline

00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:00,409
support whether you're a tutor who wants

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,030
to get involved or a student who wants

00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:06,650
to get involved you can come along and

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,469
join the community we operate on six

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,909
main values to kind of summarize the

00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,189
vibes were going for it's about more

00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:14,659
than just kids in a room at computers

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:18,829
doing the codes

00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:20,239
it's about finding friends it's about so

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,859
it has to be challenging of course so

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,109
it's to get that authentic programming

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,180
experience but we also want it to be fun

00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,099
we wanted to be social about making

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,840
friends meeting people who will like you

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,069
especially if you are a girl and you

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,739
might be the only girl in your school

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,750
interested in technology and also you

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,519
want to be able to find people who are

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,739
like you but older so we have all our

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,530
amazing shooters to show you the kind of

00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,269
people you can be in a couple years from

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,909
now so it's not just being like one day

00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,590
you could be an astronaut if you really

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,319
you know try it's like really about

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,939
having those tangible role models next

00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,859
year you could be this person they just

00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,599
did this high school subject and now

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,220
that you need doing this thing or in

00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,840
five years you could have this job you

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,729
just have to be this person and then you

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,319
can become this person and then you know

00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:05,930
the sky's limit after that you can be an

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,540
astronaut if you so desire but yes all

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,549
the steps of the way of represented we

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,769
also have see this because we have such

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,930
a diverse range of tutors and students

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,789
in the room for about creating

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,280
environment that's for all girls not

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:22,460
just for nerdy girls and people who

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,000
identify as super techie you whether you

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,050
live you know horses or playing the tuba

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,020
or

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,210
rock climbing or dancing or baking

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,530
coding can be part of your identity it

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,539
doesn't need to be the whole thing so

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,539
have a whole range of shooters who show

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,099
that they're more than just coders

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,659
finally we have the network it's about

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,979
creating those friends who you can't

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,919
wait to see next time you come back to

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:48,050
DPN it's about meeting those mentors who

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,789
you can't wait to be and it's about

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,440
connecting with people all around

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:55,069
Australia who are excited about

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,919
technology in these locations these are

00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,719
our 60 pen locations so far and

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,840
something we've learnt from having

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:04,879
spread this program around is that the

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,620
we're in counting a whole other range of

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,780
students but we hadn't encountered in

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,509
metropolitan Sydney before so we've got

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,280
people out near in cans and Makai who've

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,800
you know getting together in a classroom

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,419
on the weekend to put on one of these

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,159
events because they're all so excited

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,509
about technology but we're needing to

00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:23,750
support a whole different range of

00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:26,270
students and tutors to engage with the

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,419
program to tell you the scale of the

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,900
program we have between you know 20

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,090
students may be at a Cannes event or 180

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,830
students per workshop at a Sydney event

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,719
and we had so many that wanted to come

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,099
that we had to make it two days so we

00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,389
could have two separate workshops so it

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,190
could have twice as many students

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,289
there's a whole bunch of girls who are

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,779
super excited to learn to code from a

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,639
whole range of backgrounds so along the

00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:52,159
way we've encountered a lot of feedback

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,680
from all our different nodes helping us

00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:58,460
improve our content so we can include

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,500
more people so what have we seen so what

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,819
do we actually do to include everybody

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,349
and what activities are we actually

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,139
doing I told you we're doing coding

00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:08,659
which is cool but what do we do if we're

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,759
doing project-based learning so when we

00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,349
advertise the gpn workshop we tell them

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,310
the topic of the workshop because that's

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:16,460
how we're going to get someone excited

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,740
they go I could build scissors paper

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,539
rock game or a flappy bird or a cookie

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,129
clicker I could build a Caesar cipher

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,810
and it's something that they've gone I

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,610
want to build that that sounds exciting

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,129
rather than this come along and do a

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,139
code with us which you know if someone's

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,879
already in the club they're going to

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,259
sign up for but if they're not there yet

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,389
you're gonna excite them a little bit

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,500
but the thing is we've told them what

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,100
they're going to build but we have

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,810
literally

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,020
no idea how much coding they know you're

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,520
coming in so we've said come along and

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,440
we're just going to sort you out that's

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,390
our low barrier to entry process and

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,270
then we need to work out how to deliver

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,220
the same project goal for a complete

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,320
beginner to someone who's been coming to

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,760
the program for five years so how do we

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,350
do that and make sure everyone ticks

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,210
that box and like I did the thing that I

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,770
signed up for so I'm going to tell you

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,460
today about how we've designed our

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:10,700
projects with differentiation to enable

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,440
that so along the way I've learned a lot

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,180
of different metal and people in a lot

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,040
of different contexts about who are

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,290
excited about making projects for kids

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,480
and these are the kinds of things I

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,450
believe people think about creating

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,580
projects for students there go well kids

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,820
only want to have fun they didn't want

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,140
to do the hard things or they you know

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,180
only one sample something that looks

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,900
amazing so I can't was this very

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,220
scientific chart that I drew earlier

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,440
about where I kind of here people are

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,820
going this is what we think we should be

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,710
doing in the classroom and these are

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,610
people I've seen at competitions being

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,770
like this is what I want to teach my

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,540
kids and XO students making requests and

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,790
what they should be doing and people are

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,400
designing projects for schools and other

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,490
activities so on one end we have thee

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,620
kids just want to play and not do do the

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,180
hard work to make something happen so

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,190
these are the kinds of projects where

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,800
someone's gone we have an hour to engage

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,930
in technology so I'm going to go and get

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,700
a VR headset and we're going to have the

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,580
students take turns at watching a video

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,750
of the hacker wearing the headset which

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,190
was like if I was going to watch the

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,950
hacker that's how I would want to watch

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,080
it but this is not how I take the

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,820
technology engagement box so we've got

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,200
people flying drones for 20 minutes

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,780
they're not actually building anything

00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,050
they've touched the technology but they

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,550
haven't really learned anything yet it's

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,080
also something you might see if the

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,460
teachers themselves don't really engage

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,469
with technology in themselves and they

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,520
don't know how far it could possibly go

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,860
and what you can do with technology

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,930
other than use it like everybody who

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,580
does has technology in their house so

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,770
that's one one end of the scale on the

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,780
other end of the scale we have we have

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,250
not necessarily someone starting out

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,870
with her we're going to have to do a

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,600
really hard project they often think

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,759
it's not as hard as it looks

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,860
so a hero load of the clothes not that

00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,720
long so the kids can definitely do it

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,959
and I'm going to show you how that can

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,430
set you up for a problem in the coming

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,620
slides but yes these are the ones people

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,600
who say well no one's gonna want to do

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,339
it if it's not flashy if it's not fully

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,410
featured if it doesn't completely work

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,529
down to every last bit if it doesn't

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,120
have a GUI what are we even doing here

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,649
so I'm going to show you how we can do

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,130
cool things without a GUI that are

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,839
engaging and exciting and not that hard

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,899
so here's how I think we should actually

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,779
think about teaching kids to code it's

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,670
not just about fun and having a really

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,370
awesome thing that works at the end of

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,290
it we have the accomplishment

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,959
achievement factor in the middle here

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,639
and it's where you get to tick off small

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,560
boxes along the way and you know where

00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,470
the thing works and where it doesn't

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,069
work yet so I hear a lot of girls at gpn

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,720
you go hey look at this my program does

00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,089
this awesome thing now and then the user

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,589
usually the only mom or dad comes in to

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,410
use it at the end of the day and like no

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,380
not that stupid it doesn't do that yet

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,269
that's not like my project is about

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,889
because they know what happens now and

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,990
what's going to happen later when they

00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,610
add in more bits we've got like a simple

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,069
program and if you know the adults

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,569
who's using it makes a typo or clips in

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:10,550
a capital letter they know that it's not

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,079
going to work and isn't that amazing

00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,269
that they can tell you down to the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,870
character how their program works with

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,970
only a few hours of experience so they

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,769
get this full understanding of how maybe

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,720
a shorter text space program works

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,699
doesn't need to be flashy for them to be

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,350
excited about how it works and about

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:29,990
telling their parents how it doesn't

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,880
work and how they're stupid now on the

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,620
other end we have the thing where they

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,089
didn't really do a thing the kids know

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,649
when they didn't really do a thing they

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,689
were had fun for a little while but

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,490
that's you know good and all but you

00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,800
don't want to you know spend all your

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,060
time just having fun where you're not

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,040
really building anything you know you

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,110
could just go to the shop and you

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,360
haven't done anything unique on the

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,160
other end we have the students who

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,569
didn't really get what they were doing

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,790
because you've run out of time in the

00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,589
day to fully get through the ton SEPs

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,990
you're trying to teach you've got into a

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,270
point where like oh no they've got likes

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,399
you've only got an hour left

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,050
in the day and they barely got you know

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,050
if statements working we're going to go

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,730
through four loops some functions and a

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,620
whole bunch of gooey stuff before it

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,959
looks anything like what I promised them

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,120
so you push them through and you end up

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,680
with paint-by-numbers code which they

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,870
don't understand and don't feel like

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,420
they've you know built themselves and

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,620
where this is mostly problematic when

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,750
you're dealing with students who don't

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,100
feel like they're in the club because

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,899
they're going to go away at the end of

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,130
the day feeling like they don't belong

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,020
and they shouldn't have tried in the

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,240
first place and you know with your

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,860
project you've tried to include them but

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,200
by making it too hard you've actually

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:42,700
proven the stereotypes that girls

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,070
especially don't belong in coding so the

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,750
dream is this point for every student we

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,700
want them every student to reach their

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,500
peak but every students take is a

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,480
different point which we've heard you

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,060
know about today earlier and Ben's

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,520
talked about hitting that area for

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,060
working out what they already know so

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,580
how do we hit the peak for every student

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,800
well we're going to start with a minimum

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,390
viable project MVP you know everybody

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,640
knows that I'm just stealing some words

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,170
you're so to make your MVP you're gonna

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,079
have to start by looking at what your

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,570
constraints are for your group who is in

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,100
your group are they how old are they how

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,690
engaged today have they chosen to be

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,160
there luckily with GPM they've all

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,020
chosen to come on the weekend so they're

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,270
super excited about doing something but

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,500
if you're in a high school maybe where

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,670
they're forced to do something you're

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,410
going to have a few different

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,720
constraints in terms of engagement

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,490
we've got your ability range have some

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,829
complete beginners or some super on the

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,620
other end and know a lot of stuff how

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:44,260
much time and support do you have a GPA

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,550
and we have one tutor to every three or

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,260
four students so we've got a lot of

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,029
support but we also only have three and

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,180
a half hours so it's factoring in all

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,790
these different parts once we've got

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,570
those down we need to design an MVP for

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:00,100
our system you need to start at the

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,290
bottom people go well I've got this

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,430
awesome idea and then I want to get to

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,959
that but maybe you could just do an

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,010
easier version I'm gonna tell you you

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,170
need to start the other way around

00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,970
what's the smallest thing that you can

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,800
build to tick that box because it's

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,690
always going to be easier to add fancy

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,600
shiny things on later but getting

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,490
something paired

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,050
- the simplest version is often

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,050
impossible if you started with the

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,610
incorrect project so I think less is

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,650
more and we're going to will they work

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,930
our way up finally once you've decided

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,490
in a project that works for your context

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,710
we're going to differentiate it by

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,200
adding extensions and diversions to

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,000
distract your more speedy students

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,480
whilst also teaching them something but

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,590
not worsening your problem okay so we're

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,060
going to start with our beginners

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,370
project a GPM we have three levels

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,750
beginners intermediate advanced start at

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,190
the bottom because we want to make sure

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,810
they've ticked the box everyone else

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,270
it's gonna be easy to tick that box of

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,430
whatever we were advertised but it's

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,990
cryptography or making a game so start

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,120
with some pinners and then we go how can

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,740
we do this maybe with harder concepts

00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,850
instead of just using a lot of variables

00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,470
we're going to use some lists or a

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,450
dictionary we're going to turn it into

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,790
functions so how can we make the same

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,920
project or build on the original project

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,400
to turn it into something more

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,560
complicated next bonus activities these

00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,090
are the diversions I told you about so

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,040
along the way you might want to have

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,990
lectures in your classroom and you want

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,440
everyone to be in a similar point when

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:23,210
you give those lectures with this we're

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,070
putting in things that shift the

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,240
students sideways rather than giving

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,800
them more knowledge that will actually

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,170
worsen the problem and speed them up

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
even further so these bonus activities

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,400
might be like now change your thing from

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,040
plain text to have ASCII art pictures

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,630
when you print out something or maybe

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
we're going to add in some sleep so it

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,230
looks like the computers taking a long

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
time little bits and pieces here and

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,060
there that slow them down giving the

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,240
other students a chance to catch up

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,830
finally

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,870
you can just put as much stuff as you

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,150
want on the end yeah there's just

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,250
infinite extensions to everything

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,810
just write them all out and the kids can

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,160
either do them there if they've done

00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,570
everything and nailed it throughout the

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,850
day or take them home because if they're

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,150
excited they might go and add more onto

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:08,540
their project okay so that's what we got

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,740
to do yes but how is the real question

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,420
I've just told you how to make three

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,270
different levels of projects but just

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,950
you just do it here's my way of making

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,470
these three different levels of projects

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,090
with the five C's of content creation I

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,590
got very excited with this asaurus they

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,080
all start with C's but you've got some

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,910
extra bonus T's throughout because I was

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,400
generous so we're going to start with

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,500
contemplating your cool concepts for

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,290
context like who's the students and what

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,339
do you want to make why coach calculate

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,230
and code again I'm going to show you

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,080
something we've developed a GPM for

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,060
actually working out how hard a project

00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,160
is for your specific level before

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,960
actually inflicting it upon any children

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,490
because sometimes you're just wildly

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,140
wrong or you just missed a bunch of

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,140
concepts so we'll have a look at how you

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,250
can quantify what you're actually doing

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,279
then we're going to look at how you can

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,920
break up that project into a pathway

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,810
from no code to a final working project

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,880
and then all the extensions you want to

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,860
add along the way then we're going to

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,960
see how we can make that into booklets

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,390
that students actually want to read

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,279
rather than what they want to not read

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,529
and just pretend like they're doing the

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,960
work and finally how can we look back

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,700
improve iterate and doing better the

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,740
next time

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,730
so firstly we're looking at our class

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,620
our group wherever you are and how are

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,250
you going to engage this group is it

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,380
specifically you know girls is it kids

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,270
who really like science thoroughly into

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,180
a specific thing how can you best pick

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,339
their interest to do this project don't

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,750
go and make up something like sometimes

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,790
people go I really want to teach this

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,029
technology and then you make up a

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,580
narrative that's contrived just to fit

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,709
it in the students will know and they'll

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,720
be like this is pointless and I don't

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,130
really want to do it and also having a

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,260
narrative that doesn't really make sense

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,010
makes it harder to interpret how to

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,470
apply code to this situation now once

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,810
you've got your idea down work to that

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,880
MVP think about what the smallest

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,740
project would be and what's the more

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,140
extensions you would add onto it for

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,420
your more experienced students what's

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,600
the range or is it a very fixed area and

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,309
think about how that suits your cohort

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,809
okay we've got our idea and we're gonna

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,790
start at the bottom with coding our

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,160
beginners project because often I go

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,959
this sounds like a terrific idea and

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,819
then you actually sit down to code the

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,370
thing like oh I've got to need this list

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,710
oh this has a lot of edge cases that's a

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,230
very long if statement now or this is

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,280
getting a bit awkward so by the time you

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,809
finish it you're like this isn't as easy

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,090
as I saw it I thought it may be an if

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,340
statement a loop input and we'd be done

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,290
but often it gets a little bit harder

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,110
once you actually put

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,690
into practice so we start by coding our

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,630
thing and then we use our calculator to

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,840
quantify the challenge of this activity

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,720
for the group that we're looking at so

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,940
here is the calculator that I've come up

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,610
with by looking at lots of different gpn

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,500
projects how they went in practice what

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,780
was hard what was easy and what are the

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,940
concepts that come that are easy to

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,130
grasp onto what takes a lot of time to

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,690
explain like variables you need them but

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,390
you have to spend a lot of time on them

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,090
so these are the all effort points for

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,190
the different concepts you might use in

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,500
the classroom you'll notice that you

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,240
start to get some for free in the more

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,100
advanced classes you just kind of take

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,390
granted they will know how to do a print

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
it's not going to take a lot of time

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,740
just like chucking a print and they'll

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,630
be fine

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,680
cool we've also got some extra one so

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,660
there's previous ones were all about

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,610
Python and the things that you're using

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,650
in the code but here's some ones you

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,350
might not realize that are there things

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,820
like nested if statements or loops that

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,680
nesting factor it takes a little more

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,480
time for them to explain there's a lot

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,120
of places that things could go wrong if

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,740
you know you don't have it nested it so

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,860
it's hard thing to explain in the

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,780
classroom we also got like long code

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,130
it's useful because they get lots of

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,810
chances to practice but they also have

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,250
tiny hands and a very bad at typing so

00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,320
we did add just this little bit more

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,780
time if we're having them type something

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,880
really long and also any sort of

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,890
creative decision takes it forever

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,810
because they're like pink or green pink

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,170
or green pink or green for 20 minutes

00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,520
and yes so we've got a loud time for

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,470
those things and we all cept allow time

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,690
for any concepts we want to explain

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,280
things when we're making a game I'm

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,510
going to give you an example of how I've

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,460
used this system of how he did

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,050
tic-tac-toe and that's something they

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,120
already understand but if we want to

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,560
teach something like cryptography it's

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,510
not something that they inherently

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,970
already understand so spending time

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,980
maybe doing an unplugged activity to

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,350
communicate the concepts are about to

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,300
code takes some time out of your day and

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,190
also if you're using any additional

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,980
technology as we heard Jeff say earlier

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,380
micro bits they're distracting any

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,320
hardware is distracting all those kinds

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,179
of things can take time out of your day

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,830
so once we have

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,289
put it through our calculator we see the

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,320
score and we go is this achievable do we

00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:04,029
need to recode it or maybe this is good

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,710
for intermediate how can we work it back

00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:10,960
for something we could use with

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:12,129
beginners and then finally we reiterate

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,419
on that for a while until we get

00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,210
something we're happy where we are yes

00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:18,519
that's a good place to be at and then we

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:21,039
write what we call a GP and a break down

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,719
so we take the code that we want to get

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,599
to and we go how do can we build this in

00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:27,789
a pedagogically friendly approach we

00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,830
want also for everyone to be able to say

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,109
they've built a new thing at each step

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,299
of the way so that way we can be like

00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:37,029
we're adding the part where we check for

00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:39,519
a winner or where we play multiple turns

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:40,570
of the game so that way they know what

00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,950
they're building because when they know

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,259
what they're building it's much easier

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,109
for them to understand and put the code

00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:50,049
together in this system we also add

00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:51,759
places for extra extra practice so say

00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,580
we're playing a game of tic-tac-toe and

00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,739
we need them to ask what placed you on

00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,269
to play in we could also add some places

00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,460
for practice at the start because

00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,389
anything like what's your name what's

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,249
your favorite color

00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:05,440
just great places we can practice the

00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:10,779
same concept so it's fluid when we want

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:13,960
to use it in the project okay we've now

00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:15,820
made our plan and we want to put it into

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,609
something that the students are actually

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,409
going to see and when we do this we want

00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,679
to follow our breakdown and create in

00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:25,239
like engaging materials so we want to

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,009
make sure it's formatted nicely

00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:28,479
it's about colors it's about headings

00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,219
it's about drawing attention because

00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,899
students they hate reading they don't

00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,399
like long things I don't like reading

00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,779
long things either so we're going to

00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:37,019
grab their attention keep it in the

00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:39,969
place as we need and make sure it's

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:42,489
child-friendly short small words and

00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:44,229
only using relevant concepts for the

00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:46,779
project because if we teach them

00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:49,719
something and then don't use it it's

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:51,879
definitely gone forever

00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:53,320
also avoiding speed and feeding is great

00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:56,339
so if we're spending time only on the

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,049
concepts we need then we don't need to

00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,580
rush over those harder concepts that we

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,409
might lose time for otherwise so they

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,849
actually understand all the code that

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:08,840
they're writing okay but now built our

00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:10,340
project it looks amazing and

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,460
delivered it to the students you want to

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,049
see how it actually goes in practice and

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,999
which concepts worked well which were

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,470
harder to teach and if there any tricky

00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,749
parts that need an alternate delivery

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,789
method sometimes we go this is a great

00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:24,470
project but they get just get stuck on

00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:26,330
these two dot points that we want them

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,159
to do and sometimes something like I

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,049
coded along where they type with you

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,999
will get them over those humps which

00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,100
means there's a whole more whole range

00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:36,830
of projects you can now do which is

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,600
still exciting challenging but you don't

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:43,220
trip them up unnecessarily if they're no

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:47,049
reason okay so here is an example of how

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:50,149
we made tic-tac-toe using the five C's

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,700
so we thought what do we like a gpn they

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:55,159
really like games and text-based games

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,110
really fast to get up and running you

00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,730
can play with your friends because the

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,470
rules are well-known so that would be

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,360
easy to get them through and it's not

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:06,169
like it's a gendered game no one's like

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,029
tic-tac-toe that's the boys so there's

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,559
no stereotypes that play there so in

00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,749
have that hurdle of getting people in

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,100
the door and with tic-tac-toe it's a

00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:15,619
really simple game but there's lots of

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,690
implementations so we can just build a

00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:20,179
super plain game or we can add a whole

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:23,809
AI which will make our advanced students

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,580
do a new this project so this is my

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,740
first version of the code that we wrote

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,779
I'm like cool thinking about it what

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,730
would I do to make tic-tac-toe it's got

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:33,799
like a list then it's got some if

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,070
statements it's got a while loop to keep

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,690
the turns going and this one we're like

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,690
we won't you know we changed symbols so

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:45,350
it keeps track of whose turn it is and

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:48,559
yeah and we decide who the winner is so

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,840
we put this through the calculator and

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,659
this is how we do the calculator so we

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,830
go and find every different concept in

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:56,629
there and there's option ones that are

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,389
hiding in there that you didn't realize

00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:01,100
like things like int input that's two

00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:03,049
concepts right there that's like nine

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,029
characters two concepts that's going to

00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,259
be a boil in like a lecturing and things

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,200
that you might not have realized cuz

00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:12,080
it's so short in Python we've got a

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,659
bunch of list indexing which is tricky

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,669
and then we've got you know a lot of if

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:20,000
statements and things which is good for

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,510
practice and yeah a lot of X concepts

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,480
going around all over the place what we

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,280
with 69 points and 16 points might be

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,330
useful for your classroom if you've got

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,660
a couple of weeks

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,130
things like that but for us we only have

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,410
about three and a half hours in the

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,490
computer lab and we go for about 50 to

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,350
60 tops concepts so what did we do we

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,940
calculated it again we went what could

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,860
we do that makes this easier what

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,540
concepts can we get rid of what don't we

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,780
need a list you know it's better 9

00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,070
variables so yes when we're coding we

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,480
don't want to code like a probe we want

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,370
to code like a child who only knows

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,590
variables and if statements so that's

00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,299
the goal we're knocked out lists that

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,190
also meant we do need indexing which

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:02,309
meant we didn't need numbers so we're

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,929
also able to knock out the int input and

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,669
we just have the input and everything is

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:07,770
referenced by a string version of the

00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:09,570
number they also we're knocked out zero

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,260
indexing so we didn't need to do that

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,270
anymore

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,850
one less concept explaining why we start

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,669
counting from zero so now we have this

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,380
code we have no list no inch and more

00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:21,840
practice on variables and lots of

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,309
practice on if statements as well so now

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
we're practicing the things that they

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,400
haven't ever done before without

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,690
introducing all these extra things to

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,950
distract them and that they won't

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,860
understand so we had our code we turned

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,130
it into a breakdown so in each step of

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,220
the way

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,750
we have different parts of the project

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,299
being made we're starting the game we're

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,010
printing a blank board we're asking a

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:48,630
question what player are you and what

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,919
position would you want to go in also

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,510
you know it's something about this code

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,910
is we decided to get rid of the part

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,100
where you change turns and this this

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,140
game we also just say what who are you

00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,730
and where you want to go so that's

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,610
another thing we've knocked out there so

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,900
we've added asking who you are and where

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,000
do you want to go two questions

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,850
easier to practice then we're going to

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,230
add those to the board using our many if

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,150
statements to work out where you've gone

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,040
and then we're going to add in the loop

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,110
so you can have multiple terms and then

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,940
you get to pick the winner finally so

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,160
the reason we put it in this order is we

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,650
get to attack those different concepts

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,690
in a pedagogically friendly order

00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,970
starting with print and variables and

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,160
string operations and you know heading

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,169
onto if statements and loops and then

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,260
finally fitting up finishing up with the

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,800
harder complex and an or operations to

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,540
kind of work

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,870
the winner which can be a bit tricky so

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,460
hitting them in easy to hard order then

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,230
we looked at some parts from some

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,050
bonuses and extensions where we could

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:49,350
add those in along the way and we can

00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,030
see that it's ready to turn into a black

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,950
book so these are things from the actual

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,720
tic-tac-toe workbook we can see they're

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,700
really colorful that's how all the DPN

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,410
workbooks look colors with hints and

00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,850
checkpoints it turns out if you don't

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,530
tell the students to run their code they

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,110
just simply don't run their code and

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,940
they're like step 4 like page 4 of the

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,680
project it doesn't work anymore and

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,330
you're like well did it work in this

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,540
step and they're like don't know haven't

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,310
run it yet we were adding in all these

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,260
checkpoints let's say does it do this

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,300
when you finish this oh it does it you

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,920
know do this when it runs so you can

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,360
check along the way we've got these by

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,040
hand examples so they actually have to

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,390
engage with the workbook so they can see

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,880
that the workbook something you're

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,490
supposed to use when you do the project

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,990
and also we've got this fine algorithmic

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,060
worksheet which is telling them how to

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,220
do a min/max tree for the advanced

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,700
students so teaching recursion this is

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,560
my baby

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,680
it took me eight hours to make this one

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,250
sheet of paper but it was worth it for

00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,290
the three children who did it okay so we

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,060
then ran it in the classroom and it went

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,850
pretty well I thought it had mostly

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,140
engaged everybody and most of the

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,610
students got a lot of the way through

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,310
but there were some things we learned

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,870
along the way like printing a blank

00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,250
board doesn't really make sense when

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,560
you're using variables they're like why

00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,000
would I add in and it's like a string

00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,100
that's just got a space in it when I

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,110
could just print out a blank board

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,150
because I know how to do that so we're

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,680
like maybe for this scenario we can give

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,690
them another example where they need to

00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,970
figure out what kind of board they're

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,940
going to print how would you print X X X

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,160
X X and get them to put in the variables

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,960
so they can figure out how the variables

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,790
actually interact with the grid this

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,000
linear set of numbers needs to get

00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,650
inside the grid somehow and also you

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,500
know how I said we've got rid of the

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,060
part where we switch turns getting rid

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,550
of that code keeps the code shorter

00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,130
turns out they really don't get that

00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:40,350
taking turns it's so intuitive that

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,790
removing the extra code actually made

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,710
the project harder because they were

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,740
like but when's that the other players

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,590
turn and like rolling it you're asking

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,940
every time

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,799
whose turn it is but they didn't

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,019
understand that part so actually adding

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,730
in more code in this section could be

00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:58,389
beneficial because of the intuitive

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,429
nature of tic-tac-toe so this is how we

00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:02,350
made this project we did this for

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,509
beginners and for intermediate we had

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,620
this basically early original code and

00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,169
then finally advanced to the

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,840
intermediate and also that fun extension

00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:13,539
with the AI that played against them so

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,340
this is how you can use these concepts

00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:18,279
in your classroom or wherever you're

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,340
teaching to scale a project to your

00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,539
timeline and a level of ability

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,269
calculate how hard something is before

00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:27,070
you actually have to run it and create a

00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:30,179
coding journey that gets them through

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:33,179
the process yeah so I hope you try it

00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:36,009
these are me you can send me things and

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:42,940
yeah the slides are there I will say v

00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:46,419
on my Twitter later as well thanks Renee

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,669
so we're now interchange over time so if

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,940
you were planning to shift rooms for the

00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,940
