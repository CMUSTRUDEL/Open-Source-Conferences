Title: "3D Rendering with Python" - Andrew Williams (PyCon AU 2019)
Publication date: 2019-08-03
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Andrew Williams

Create 3D rendered animations in a few lines of Python, for teaching concepts in Physics and Astronomy. Let your students write some simple code to, for example, model the movement of a bouncing ball due to gravity, and with only a couple of lines of extra code, actually render and animate the ball.
