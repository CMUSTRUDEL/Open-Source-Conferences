Title: Using comedy as an excuse to play with python-programmed microcontrollers
Publication date: 2019-08-03
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Anthony I. Joseph, Debbie Zukerman

Early-career comedians often have difficulties adding electronic props to their acts, due to the high cost of materials and fabrication skills required. This talk will recreate several props used in comedic performances, showing the code and components used.

all right welcome back and thank you

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,110
everyone again so and next speakers

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,969
Anthony Joseph and Debbie Zukerman

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,740
please welcome to the stage they're

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,139
talking to date with us about using

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,480
comedy as an excuse to play with Python

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,539
program for microcontrollers thank you

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,330
thank you thank you

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:29,880
hi oh yeah thank you hi I'm Debbie this

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,260
is anthony hi i'm anthony it's just

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,790
before we start I would like to

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,890
acknowledge the traditional owners of

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,570
the country in which we meet on today

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,730
the gadigal people of the eora nation

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,860
and recognize their continuing

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,260
connection to the land water and the

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,239
culture we also pay our respects to the

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:53,730
elders past present and emerging so yes

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:58,469
I'm Evy and I am NOT an engineer I'm not

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,390
a computer scientist I'm a comedian so

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,019
the reason I'm here is just because

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,729
Anthony I was at a gig this is the part

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,610
where I say that right yes yes I was at

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,460
a gig about a year and a half ago and I

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,750
was doing a character where I do science

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,689
and it's like real hard-hitting

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:23,280
cutting-edge science like mixing vinegar

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,920
and by carving and Anthony was like wow

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,509
you're a real scientist anyway he was

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,100
talking to me after the show and he we

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,400
were talking about science and comedy

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,570
and ever since then Anthony would come

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,189
to me every few months like send me a

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,619
message and say yo I have this idea for

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,189
something you can do on stage and that

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,680
escalated when this year in April he was

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:52,049
like hey I think we should do a talk in

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:56,009
the Python country sure happened right

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,799
yeah yeah and I said about what and he

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,259
said I reckon tech could really be

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,240
useful for performance and I said hey

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,670
we've got lights we've got sound we have

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,950
smoke machines what else do we need and

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,349
he said I think you could use a theremin

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,680
yes so I tried to make one and we'll see

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,879
how the

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,920
works so what was the witch Symphony

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:30,329
wasn't oh yes yes and she's gonna pet

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:32,189
play Beethoven's fifth symphony yeah I

00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:37,909
couldn't even do that

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:42,290
and the next prop he made was this wand

00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:44,879
magic wand by the power of Grayskull

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,609
Anthony you're not wearing a tie it's

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,370
gonna spin your own yeah I know right I

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:51,810
want a t-shirt said so oh yeah I do a

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,829
flower though that might spin okay great

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,829
I'll spin your flower by the power it up

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:18,930
by the power of Grayskull flower flip

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:20,790
end oh yeah but yeah so that kind of

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,919
work yeah I do have a question for you

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:28,230
oh yeah yeah it make a sound

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,599
does this look comedy to you cuz at

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:41,190
least to this killed during the

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:44,519
rehearsals like yeah but yeah so yeah

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,139
okay like I said I'm not a tick person I

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,909
did one year of computer science and

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:53,250
looking for bugs that it's not fun I

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:56,430
don't know how you do it neither do I

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,919
really sorry I'm gonna throw it to

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,359
Anthony to explain how all these are the

00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,049
most important we didn't explain the

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:07,590
skirt yes okay so the skirt will

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,960
actually light up when you clap so do

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,610
things worth around our applause

00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,560
[Applause]

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,920
yeah it would be so good that actually

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,530
what we couldn't get it to work and in

00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,970
fact one time it caught on fire so I'm

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,560
just going to take it off the bad kind

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,540
of like you know thing from The Hunger

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,580
Games

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,720
yeah so that's Debbie's view electronics

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,460
this is my this is how I feel about

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,160
electronics which is why I'm talking to

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,820
Anthony to explain these things work or

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,990
don't work don't work so today I'm just

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,970
going to give it a quick introduction to

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,800
all the kinds of things that we built so

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,960
the one with spinning flour sort of

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,300
spinning flour the skirt that sodomite

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,800
lit up the theremin and I going to

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,240
introduce a piece of software called cue

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,290
lab and how that could actually relate

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,740
to a performers like act and also try to

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,600
leave some time for Q&A as well but like

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,000
the designs some coding examples because

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,780
this is a patent conference and some of

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,230
the lessons that we learned along the

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,540
way so the first bit that we used was

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,000
the circuit playgrounds is made by ada

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,210
fruits can be programmed with Python

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,420
using the circuit Python libraries later

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,640
on end up using the Adafruit flora these

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,910
are both wearable devices kind of

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,020
purpose-built to be sewn into clothing

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,910
there's other things like people have

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,910
seen at previous talks about the micro

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,980
bits and the little the lily pad as well

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,140
which is another very popular wearable

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,910
tech and just on the other side just to

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,120
give some reference there's the

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:48,980
classical PC tweener Arduino style

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,170
programmable boards so the magic wand so

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,490
the idea is that it required charging

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:58,010
charging like magical charging not

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:01,460
lateral and charging so once it's fully

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,450
charged it would kind of flash like that

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,720
and play a sparkle sound if it worked

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:11,570
like that if anyone heard that and if

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,640
you didn't charge up enough my here on

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,230
the video yeah it's very very faint but

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,350
it kinda makes like this one more kind

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:21,350
of sound so we all made this from

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,540
scratch so when I bought a some pieces

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,880
of dowel painted it with a quick paint

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:29,600
use a circuit playground we

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,100
some of the neopixel leds and use

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,470
conductive thread and nail polish to

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,820
connect them together but it didn't

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,910
really work out

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,620
what ended up happening was the

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,460
connectors that I tried to do were way

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,440
too fragile

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,750
we had short circuits it just wasn't

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,160
working out so tried version 2 and

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,910
version 2 use a strip LED strip here

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,200
instead and we used the solder we

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,490
actually sold our things together so it

00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,690
actually worked so if anyone remembers

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,490
dick Smith and they used to sell

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,170
electronics and stuff I had this one

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:09,770
like way back when I've still got most

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:11,450
of it left nice but you're gonna go into

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,670
that the coating of it one of the things

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,230
I learnt actually building this was

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,210
thinking terms of states made the

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,950
current a lot simpler so went from like

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,260
the charging state to the charge

00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,550
sparkling and the charge failed meant I

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,620
could simplify a lot of the curve

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,600
because I was just programming the main

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,780
duty loop how it responds to different

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,550
states oh gosh I didn't actually come

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,990
out to where I promised the vod's it's a

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,880
lot better to read later on and I put

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,310
the code on github so I'll leave the

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,890
address at the end of time so I use the

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,810
library called fancy LED and that

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,590
actually simplifies a lot of the code

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,550
that you might have to do with

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,140
programming LEDs so you can like here if

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,590
you can read it you can just give it

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,090
like an RGB code and it will tell you

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,680
and you'll be able to curl like a

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,820
particular color but if you want to have

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,120
like a spectrum of color like we had

00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,490
like from the red to the green it will

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,010
automatically do that interpolation for

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,660
you which actually is a lot easier when

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,650
you actually looked to some other coding

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,520
snapless when you want to do like a

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,900
rainbow style effect and displaying a

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,290
release it's actually pretty simple in

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,300
circuit python if you just want to set

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,710
the color just like that gold what I go

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,540
do is just like the pixels don't feel

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,820
passing the color and say pixels let's

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,410
show and it does it for you so the

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,210
libraries take a lot of the heavy

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,980
lifting out for you and if you want to

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,940
do that John pressing the other button

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,310
yep awesome I love that sound

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,190
just that oscillating effect all you

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,560
need to do is just use this fancy pallet

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,450
lookup and it automatically you get

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,940
all of the colors for you and you just

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,450
had that changing every about half a

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,600
second or so playing sounds like the

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,370
little sparkle sound the circuit Python

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,010
libraries give a lot already for you so

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,870
you just say CPX stop play file and just

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,860
give it a wave file and it automatically

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,910
figures it out for you

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,740
pretty cool at least for me also using

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,070
input as well

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,110
there's button a button B and they just

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,990
resolved a true and false in your code

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,460
so you can just check those values at a

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,740
particular point in time and they can be

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,150
used to trigger different behavior so

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,520
it's spinning flower I thought this was

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,230
cool the time but because spinning tiles

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,700
are a bit too hard and I'm kind of it

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,280
didn't have anything that spinning that

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,080
close on there so the idea is is that

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,170
really simple behavior press a button

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,880
servo motor spins so use the circuit

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,550
playground again with a little micro

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,560
servo motor and a little artificial

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,010
flower that I got from Ikea so thank you

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,370
IKEA and alligator clips just to connect

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,810
all things together a lot of preamble

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,730
code here the things that you might be

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,700
more concerned about it's just here

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,650
where if we call the spin motor function

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,839
it just goes through a range of angles

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,400
and just turns murder to that really

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,260
really simple a lot of this stuff kind

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,620
of comes out of the box with the circuit

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,500
playground libraries here we have a

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,550
confession we have a confession to make

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,910
the wand didn't actually spin the flower

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:18,140
yes it did sorry already disappointed

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,640
already yet we actually wanted it to but

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,080
it seems like there was limitations in

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,040
what was available at the time but

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,600
there's a new version of the circuit

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,760
playground coming out which has

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,430
Bluetooth capabilities so theoretically

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,500
we could have it so when Debbie shakes

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,720
the one it goes and since that

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,610
automatically without me having to vary

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm conspicuously where I go through my

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,300
pockets to find a button to press her to

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,160
actually make the motor spin so

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,640
yeah I'm not the actor here so I don't

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,800
have to worry about this okay so the

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,570
obscure supply gun which is a I've had a

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,940
better name for this before but the

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,040
Adafruit website has a lot of really

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,470
cool like maker examples and one of them

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,940
was this sparkles skirt so we want to

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,510
actually have it so reacted to sound

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,600
over movement so we just found a skirt

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:11,990
on ASOS we I'm still getting the

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,730
targeted ads for lady skirts once again

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,040
using the circuit playground near pixel

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,240
IDs and conductive thread so here the

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,320
problem was not the programming the

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,860
problem was actually using the

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,959
conductive current which so it creates

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,790
so many shorts all the time and you're

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,209
trying to find where is the short like

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,010
we're getting from bugs actually like

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,250
literal bugs like we actually burnt a

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,570
nice little hole that skirt I'm trying

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,160
it out so we always bent down a food

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:43,790
court or the first time but I'm nail

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,560
polish can be used to use two concerns

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,350
because the cable itself is pretty

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,579
slippy in its own right but yeah you

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,890
have to be really care about they're so

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:55,850
short surface cuz even with like the low

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,200
voltage you can still create a spark but

00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,270
we tried to do a version two with a

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,300
little bit more safety in it arm and

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:04,730
we're trying to use the these strips of

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,410
LEDs again but don't think I had enough

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,270
power in the circuit and we just ran out

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,490
of time but yeah version to you very

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,399
similar except very similar in terms of

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,779
how we got the lights to display but we

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,089
were actually using the onboard

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,980
microphone and how the onboard

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,410
microphone would work is that we would

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,910
sample for a short period of time and

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,339
then calculate the root mean square of

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,750
that there's a really cool example in

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:32,000
the core trying to website showing how

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,279
to do all this and then based on that

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,779
value you can just sample it down to a

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,370
particular point where if you get enough

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,860
sound it kind of lights up progressively

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:44,360
so at least I was a theory behind it I

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,880
promise it works so the theremin this

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,070
one was a pretty fun one the idea was

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,959
that it would play sound by an on-board

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,510
speaker circuit playground has an

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,089
on-board speaker or you can use the PWM

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,720
on

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,100
that to drive an on external speaker and

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,680
much like with most theremins they were

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:07,050
supposed to change the pitch based on

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,670
the device movement so I tried the first

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,050
version of it which was the more purest

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,370
version of it I affectionately referred

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,550
to as the game boy falling down a flight

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:25,470
of stairs because it didn't really work

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:27,180
too well it sounds like it sounds like

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:33,660
expert mode of dr. Mario or something

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:34,589
like that not everything works all the

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,970
time I think that was actually a little

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,290
bit while the humbling kind of thing for

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,170
me as well but it kind of emphasizes

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,939
teamwork as well because I showed this

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,730
to Debbie and her partner Steve and

00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:46,079
Steve said well why don't you try

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,809
something different and I'll show you

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,550
the code example first before I do that

00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:53,100
so basically what I was doing was I was

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,809
taking in the raw accelerate the road

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,999
readings from the accelerometer X Y Zed

00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,189
movement and then adding that to a base

00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:04,290
frequency and then playing that through

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:05,970
the player through the audio sound but

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,220
when I was talking to Steve about that

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,709
and Debby Steve said well why'd you use

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,519
the chromatic scale and I was like yes I

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,410
knew that because I did all 660 as a

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,529
piano and my parents will be ashamed of

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,379
me if I didn't learn anything from bats

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,420
so I feel a little bit of googling later

00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:27,779
we ended up with the version 2 which

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:33,240
ended up showing like this and something

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:34,439
else has come up on the screen so this

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,480
is the one that I was actually trying to

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:39,059
play so and the sound isn't coming out

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,220
so parties were but this one actually

00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,319
had the light changing depending on what

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,970
net was being played so red being like

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:49,850
the lowest C and going up in increments

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,959
sorry about that Peter didn't work and

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,819
this one he actually end up having a

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,059
little lookup table that would go and

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:58,949
show what the note was and the color as

00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,629
well and the code just looked that up

00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:03,029
based on only one actors there this time

00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:06,450
the x-axis so dude she's there to look

00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:10,680
that up so

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,730
this is me doing comedy not technical

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,810
and I can't remember what I was supposed

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,190
to say with this slide right okay so

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:22,589
these props might be totally hilarious

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,940
but then we were talking about something

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,560
that's actually really practical that

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,899
would be practically useful for

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,529
performance there's a program called Q

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,420
lab that most independent performers use

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,920
probably all over the world and it

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,079
basically just lines up all your cues

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,540
and like you like to use your sound cues

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,000
and then when you give it to a tech they

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,410
can just hit the next cue now the thing

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,690
is when you're at a festival like a

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,579
Fringe Festival or a comedy festival the

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,959
tech is never seen your show like maybe

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,670
you get to spend an hour with the tech

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,269
while they like go okay when do I do

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,880
that Q but if you could cure your own

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:59,130
stuff from the stage just by going ah

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,740
and then the lights change that would be

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:06,269
amazing because everything would happen

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:09,029
on time it would be amazing it would say

00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:12,630
what an cool app itself made by figure

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:14,459
53 they have a iOS remote so not only

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,070
can be controlled but on a Mac it can be

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,120
control from a iOS device but I thought

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,399
let's try to take this a little bit

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,170
further let's see whether we can do

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,459
something with the wearable tech so I

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,720
use the Adafruit flora for this one

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:27,750
mainly because we didn't have Bluetooth

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,540
comms on the circuit playground and we

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,190
use the Flores Bluetooth chip and some

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,870
push buttons just to prove the concept

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:38,310
so here's a video I made and so this is

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,529
like a MacBook running separately and

00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,029
what's happening is the MacBook thinks

00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,910
it's pairing to a keyboard but in

00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:47,310
reality it's the flora on the bottom

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,529
bottom so he proposed about me you could

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,199
told the bad joke you can't have an

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,920
audience applauding anyways because I'm

00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,649
like that right

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,879
and so what happens we press the button

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,959
the fora is sending out B press and this

00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,959
is if you tell good joking at the rim

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,909
shot I press the letter B and Q lab

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,669
recognized the bun b being pressed as

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:11,230
she goes to the sound effect so it's

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,240
something very very simple just to cry

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,789
proof that we can kind of get these

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,990
communications happening everything a Qi

00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,260
triggered from something other than a

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,000
keyboard so I don't know kind of go into

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,760
too much of Arduino code but basically

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,860
all what was happening was we ended up

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,019
just using this Bluetooth print and we

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,570
ended up just printing out ASCII

00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:34,330
characters like their hex representation

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,740
of it so all the MacBook thinks is that

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,789
someone's pressing let it be and then

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:49,889
letting go but yeah that's our talk

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:52,570
today yeah so I actually went to see the

00:17:49,889 --> 00:18:00,010
Debbie's troop to to to perform last

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:04,299
week or so an ever lost lost cabaret

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:08,169
which is a lot of fun if I go long end

00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:09,340
up Thank You Abby Bakshi but yeah I

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,919
figured we'll have like a little bit

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,870
extra Q&A time just so if you want to

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:23,649
ask Debbie any question Anthony any

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:25,120
questions yes thanks in the audience

00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,760
gonna get you to put your hand up we'll

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,870
come around with the microphone who

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,690
would like to go first

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,690
I hear we have one you guys

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,560
hi for your Bluetooth library what were

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,490
you using is that standards that corn

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,460
the Arduino or was an extra oh yeah so I

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,520
forgot the exact library I do have the

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,480
source code on github so that's going to

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,530
so you do take a photo of it it does

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
have that but I wasn't using anything

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,270
special it was just the UM I guess the

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,210
extra Adafruit

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:02,820
Bluetooth libraries that would do that

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,590
so yeah no special trickery is all they

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,780
actually were really good like example

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,160
on the website that kind of shows doing

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,830
that coms but I kind of tripped a lot of

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,560
it out so I just worked standalone hey

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,800
the theremin was really cool oh cool

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,600
have you thought about combining two of

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,070
them and then replicating the actual

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,660
behavior of a real theorem and rather

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,410
than just the chromatic scale with X Y

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,270
Zed that would be awesome actually

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,410
I mean like because we kind of like will

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,490
kind of experience a whole bunch of

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,810
technology this is kind of ones that

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:36,410
kind of made the shortlist like I say we

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:39,870
because mainly me doing like crazy ideas

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,670
and I mean like and also like I guess

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,900
from a tech kind of meeting comedy kind

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,270
of point of view that collaboration

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,800
really works when you everyone's not

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,390
talking with each other like hey does

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,130
this work will this work long stage like

00:19:48,390 --> 00:20:03,810
I noticed actually how it works in the

00:19:50,130 --> 00:20:06,840
real world so yeah phase 2 version 3 I

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,280
have a question can you tell us about

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,260
any performances you might have used

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,400
these props in so far what you might

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,190
planning

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,710
well actually what I wanted Anthony to

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,000
make with some boxing gloves that when

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,810
you punch they go like whack pow

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,810
and then sometimes they would just go

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,130
wah wah I don't know I just thought that

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,860
would be I don't know what the whole

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,600
show would be but a boxer that does that

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,600
[Laughter]

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,790
but I mean like as you can kind of see

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,080
we could actually combine a whole bunch

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,090
of different like on the standalone

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,010
paths to actually probably make that as

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,650
well so we could probably use cue light

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,890
to cue the audio files remotely and

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,830
embed those I like the flora into like

00:20:49,890 --> 00:21:02,370
whole be like you know oversized boxing

00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:04,230
gloves something like that so if we

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,570
there aren't any more questions from the

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,510
audience we might leave it there if

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,890
you're interested in micro path and in

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,290
particular I think we have quite a few

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,060
other talks and maybe an open space

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,370
there's a little discussion happening on

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,350
slack this has been fascinating so let's

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,280
thank our speakers one more time thank

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,280
