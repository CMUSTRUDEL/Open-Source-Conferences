Title: "Forecasting Australia's 2019 Election with PyMC3" - Martin Burgess (PyCon AU 2019)
Publication date: 2019-08-02
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Martin Burgess

Can we predict the result of an Australian election before it occurs? How certain of the outcome can we be? My talk will use the 2019 Australian federal election as a case study to provide an entry-level introduction to the benefits of probabilistic forecasting and PyMC3.

Thanks hi everyone thanks so much for

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,250
being here um yeah I definitely didn't

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,590
expect this many people to show up so

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,240
it's just really encouraging and partly

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,750
terrifying but mostly accelerating which

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,020
is really really great yeah so my name

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,699
is Martin as Rachel introduced me during

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,890
the day I work as a consultant and Nass

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,439
group and we try and use data to have a

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,330
positive influence in the world but yeah

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,880
I've also made Buckley's a nun which is

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,960
a forecast of the Australian election

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,910
and you can check that out at Buckley's

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,680
and then calm if you want to follow

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,870
along I've put my slides up at Buckley's

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,870
an uncommon which just takes you

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,370
straight to a github notebook they

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,500
haven't read it perfectly in there but

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,579
you'll still be able to follow along I

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,590
wanted to be really clear up the top

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,420
what I hope you'll get out of my talk so

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,739
there are two key things one is that I

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,850
hope you'll understand some of the

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,199
benefits of probabilistic forecasting

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,629
understand what that is understand why

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,460
it can really help you give a great idea

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,900
of the uncertainty around forecast that

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,180
you might be making or models that

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,979
you're trying to build how it can help

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,740
you make decisions and make your

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,710
assumptions really clear the second

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,750
thing that I hope you'll be able to see

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,799
is how easy it is to build models like

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,590
this in PI MC 3 so it's a great -

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,659
library that does a lot of the backend

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,770
stuff for you so you can really worry

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,850
about how your models defined and

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:37,799
designed my talk will have three quick

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,240
sections one just describing

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,060
probabilistic forecasting and its

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,170
benefits second defining the problem so

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,420
that everyone's on the same page about

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,280
how Australian elections work because I

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,799
understand not everyone's as much as a

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,860
political junkie as me and three

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,960
building a model in PI MC 3 I did want

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,259
to say just at the top as well while the

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,360
talks called forecasting Australia's

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:02,460
2019 election and I'm very interested in

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200
politics today I'm just really using

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,939
that as an example so you can understand

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,459
how probably stick forecasting works

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,360
more generally and I'm sure you have

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,280
really interesting and wonderful

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,410
problems that you'll be able to apply

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,700
this kind of thinking to and

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,060
build models for so first what is

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,800
probabilistic forecasting so rather than

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,650
trying to identify the single most

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,090
likely outcome probabilistic forecasting

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,410
tries to estimate the relative

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:35,790
probabilities of all possible outcomes a

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:39,300
real obvious and common example of that

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,460
is in weather forecasting so rather than

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,840
just saying whether it will rain or not

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,450
rain on a particular day weather

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,580
forecasts provide us with relative

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,070
probabilities of that that outcome so

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,650
the chance of rain being 30% and not

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,140
raining being 70% and I just wondered

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,120
across the room if you saw a weather

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:03,120
forecast like this how many of you would

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:06,660
bring an umbrella one you are a risky

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,580
crowd maybe a few would you be who would

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,260
be surprised if it rained on a day where

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,420
it said that there was a 30% chance of

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,330
rain e you'd be surprised a few people

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,810
would be surprised keep that in mind as

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,940
we kind of go along why would you want

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,500
to forecast probabilistically I'd say

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,020
the key reason is that the future is

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,130
uncertain and if you take anything away

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,360
from what I say today let it be this

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,310
somewhat convoluted sentence that is

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,870
sometimes something other than the most

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,570
likely outcome happens so sometimes when

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,820
it sometimes when the forecast says

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,489
there's a 30% chance of rain it will

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,890
rain sometimes when Donald Trump runs

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,660
for an election and that I didn't

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,000
forecast this but a website in the

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,670
States 538 had a 30% chance of him

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,520
winning sometimes that happens sometimes

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,230
when you're in an exam and you guess a

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,209
multiple choice answer sometimes you'll

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,890
get that right you have 425 percent

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,390
chance of getting that right so

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,270
sometimes something other than the most

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,890
likely thing happens and so

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,480
probabilistic forecasting can give you a

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,250
really really clear idea of the

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,690
uncertainty associated with your

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,160
prediction and the difference between

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:20,100
how likely different outcomes are so

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,320
this is the one side of I guess pseudo

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,039
bragging that I have today there won't

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,810
be too much of it on the left-hand side

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,760
you have

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,410
the forecast from news polls so they

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,810
don't just do polling they also put out

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,270
forecasts and they said that the

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,639
coalition would win 65 seats labour

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,680
would win 80 seats and six seats would

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,000
go to the cross bench and the margin

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,030
between the two major parties would be

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,790
15 seats on the right hand side I've got

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,710
a figure from Buckley's and none and so

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,940
across the bottom we've got a whole

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,699
range of different possible outcomes

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,500
from the Labour Party winning 36 more

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,080
seats than the coalition all the way

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,690
through to the coalition winning 36 more

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,139
seats than the LP and I've highlighted

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,780
that same point where the ALP wins 15

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,220
more seats than the coalition here and

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,979
you can see that we gave that specific

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,070
outcome a 5.1 percent chance of

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,770
occurring and outcomes more extreme the

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,889
Labour winning higher margin than that

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,919
had lower probability than 5.1 and less

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,470
extreme had more probability of

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,090
happening and so there's two things I

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,350
want you to well the one thing that I

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,240
really want you to take away from this

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,520
is that this gives you a really clear

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,470
idea of the different possible outcomes

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,410
of what can happen before something has

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,000
actually occurred the other thing that I

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,550
think is less important but it's also

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,440
relevant is that our the peak of our

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,870
distribution was actually closer to the

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,460
actual outcome which is over here where

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,620
the coalition won nine more seats than

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,360
the ALP the second great reason to do

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,830
some probabilistic forecasting is that

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,160
you can use these probabilities you've

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:02,780
generated to make decisions so one

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,430
person was brave enough I suppose or

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,530
depending on how you define bravery to

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,729
bet 1 million dollars on labour winning

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,440
the federal election and hopefully you

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,880
can see that it might just be a touch

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,130
small but the Buckley's Arnon forecast

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,419
had different probabilities for what was

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,550
going to happen at different points

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,740
throughout the election campaign but if

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,289
I took the most optimistic view of what

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,330
was going to happen with respect to

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:32,340
label winning we had them at a 70%

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,050
chance that they would win and a 30%

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,570
chance that the coalition would win

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,099
that's sort of the I think the best you

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,380
could ever have looked at our forecast

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,390
in the scene for the ALP

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,850
and so if you take those two numbers a

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,830
70% chance for the ALP win and for this

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,620
punter was that they would win two

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:52,190
hundred and thirty thousand dollars so

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,530
230 times 0.7 plus or the chance of

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,360
losing a million dollars a 30% chance of

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,670
losing a million dollars you can quite

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,840
clearly see that it's not worth taking

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,880
that bet and hopefully it's also just

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,980
not worth betting on elections period

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,270
one way or the other so there are two

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,870
reasons one their future is uncertain

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,650
and so classifying uncertainty or

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,360
estimating uncertainty is really

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,430
important too

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,170
it can you can take your probabilities

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,990
and use them to make decisions the third

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,460
which we'll see as we go along is that

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,100
you have to make your assumptions clear

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,000
when you're going into probabilistic

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,470
forecasting and that can be really

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,730
helpful because two people can have

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,130
really different assumptions and you

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:39,230
have to say what they are before you get

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,640
started so to defining the problem so

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,220
what was actually trying to do with

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,830
Buckley's and none primarily I was

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,780
trying to forecast before it happened

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,550
who would win the federal election and

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,550
that's decided by the House of

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,070
Representatives which is made up of 151

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,510
seats so there are three at the end of

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,190
the day there are three primary outcomes

00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,990
that I had one was that the coalition

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,610
would win a majority that means that

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,370
they would win seventy six more or more

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,170
seats to is that labor would win a

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,180
majority they'd win seventy six or more

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,220
seats and three is that neither party

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,440
would win 76 or more seats because

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,200
enough would go to the cross bench and

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,820
that means politics gets involved in who

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,710
decides who the winner is

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,750
and so I wasn't interested in that so I

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,660
had three outcomes one coalition winning

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:28,460
two alp winning and three minority

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,050
government so working backwards we want

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,580
to know who the winner is we need to

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,729
know who the number the number of seats

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,219
that each party wins and Australia is a

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,180
little bit weird in that it has

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,250
preferential voting so not many places

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,260
around the world have preferential

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,849
voting and that means when people go to

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,950
vote they don't just indicate their most

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,440
preferred candidate they number their

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,020
candidates from most to least preferred

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,220
and that means that rather than

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,260
calculating

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,940
the primary vote or who people are

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,170
picking first what's really really

00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,760
important when you're trying to

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,160
determine the margin between the two

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,340
major parties is this thing called the

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,960
two-party preferred vote which is how

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,029
much they prefer one of the major

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,020
parties versus another a few of the

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,339
seats that we're not really going to

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,560
deal with today go to the cross bench

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,630
but most seats are determined by this

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,029
two-party preferred vote and that's

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,940
usually represented by two numbers the

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,589
coalition two-party preferred so they

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,570
might have fifty five percent and the

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:26,130
alp two-party preferred which is forty

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,500
five percent but those two numbers

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,910
always add up to one hundred and so

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,620
rather than using two numbers will use

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,870
one number today and that's the

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,650
two-party preferred margin and I've

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,600
arbitrarily defined that as being when

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,040
that's positive the Coalition has more

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
two-party preferred vote and when that's

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,050
negative the lp has more two-party

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,540
preferred vote and I've simply done that

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,210
because it means that on the number line

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,290
the coalition is on the right and the

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,290
Labour Party is on the left

00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:02,210
thank you so we want to get to who the

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,740
winner is we need to know the number of

00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,470
seats to get there we're going to get

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,230
the two-party preferred vote and to do

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,730
that helpfully polling companies go out

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,350
and ask people who they're going to vote

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,420
for and then they estimate the two-party

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,670
preferred vote from that oh I just

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,890
wanted to take a quick moment to I guess

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,480
lay out some of the different places of

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,410
uncertainty that can go into this system

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,970
which we're trying to model we might not

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,130
capture all of these different places of

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,140
uncertainty but we're trying to do so

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,000
polls have sampling error because

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,260
they're only going to a small number of

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,670
people and then trying to extrapolate

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,370
what's happening in the whole country

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,050
they all also have other types of survey

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,470
era where people don't have landline

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:48,140
phones anymore so that skews who they

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,450
actually end up speaking to we also have

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,070
polls been taken a particular point in

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,410
time and so people change their mind

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,570
from that also the relationship between

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,120
the two-party preferred vote and the

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,550
number of seats our party wins isn't

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,800
always uniform and so we need to

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,450
calculate uncertainty in that

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,880
relationship too so all these different

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,950
things can cause different election

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,240
results from the same set of polling

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:18,500
data and it's really important to take

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:19,820
note of that so this is the not quite

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,470
the full model there are a few bits and

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,280
pieces that I just don't have time to go

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,500
through today

00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,100
but I'm going to basically step us

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,890
through two different two mini models

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,180
today and then take us back and bring it

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,250
all together so if you're following

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,470
along you might just want to stay on

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,450
this slide but you can see here we

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,090
aggregate the polling data and so this

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,620
is one little model and then here we

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,480
estimate the relationship between the

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,220
two-party preferred margin and the seat

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,530
margin and that's a second model and

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,210
then the rest of this is just bringing

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,550
those two models together and then doing

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,600
some math to work out how many seats

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,580
each of the parties won I'll go through

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,200
that step by step now and this is the

00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,390
output that we get at the end of it so

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,430
we get an estimate of the number of

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,170
seats that the alp will win an estimate

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,279
of the number of seats that the

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,490
coalition or the liberal

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,689
National Coalition LNC as I put there an

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,120
estimate of the number of seats that

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,379
will be won by the cross bench and also

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,230
an estimate of the two-party preferred

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:20,720
margin and here I've put the actual

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,959
results from the election as a yellow

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,749
bar on each we'll get into that in a bit

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:30,620
more detail so how do we build a model

00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:34,689
in PMC three first of all what is pi MC

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:39,740
3 so pi MC 3 is a probabilistic library

00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:41,959
it uses math achill mathematical method

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,660
called Markov chain Monte Carlo which is

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:48,189
a sampling method so rather than trying

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,480
to do explicit calculations of the

00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:53,779
distributions of probability from the

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,420
data that it has it samples those and

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:59,420
the great thing about pi MC 3 is if none

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,730
of what I just said made sense to you it

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,800
doesn't have to because it's left the

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,290
math to the mathematicians and it lets

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,670
scientists do their modeling I mean we

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,430
all want to be careful and understand

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,500
the methods that were using it but it's

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,360
just it's made it really really

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,410
straightforward and it I think it puts

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:22,160
the right decisions

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:25,759
you know modelers hands PI MC 3 uses the

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,350
Bayesian method to do to build a model

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,839
so we need to specify three things

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,509
firstly we need to specify a prior which

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,480
is what we think could be possible

00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:38,019
before we've shown our model any data we

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,970
give it our data and we also spare

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,129
specify a likelihood that takes our

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,649
prior and transforms it based on our

00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,569
observations and gives us what's called

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,089
a posterior distribution of probability

00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:55,579
which is our assumptions and our data

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:58,429
combined so first our first little mini

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:02,449
model is transferring poles together so

00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:04,670
transfer moles into the an estimate of

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:06,769
the two-party preferred vote but as a

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,620
probabilistic estimate so not just an

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,300
average of those but what possible

00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:16,069
outcomes there could be for the

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:19,040
two-party preferred vote so there's a

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:20,449
fair bit going on here I'll just take

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,750
you through it step by step so across

00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,430
the

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,980
and we have five different polling firms

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,930
News poll central galaxy it's awesome

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,300
Morgan so they're different companies

00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,400
that go into and call people or ask

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,710
people in person what they're intending

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,690
to vote for on the x-axis we have the

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,150
two-party preferred margin and so again

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:41,030
coalition is up the top and the ALP is

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,400
down the bottom each of the dots here

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,650
represents one pole and I've adjusted

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,650
these poles based on the historical

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:53,840
performance of each of the pollsters at

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:56,570
different points so the size of the

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,360
circle is actually based on how much

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,940
that how consistent that pollster has

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,560
been in the past so larger circles have

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,540
less weight in the model and tighter

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,870
circles have more weight because they've

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,760
been more consistent in the past I put

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,010
three lines here one is the raw polling

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,990
mean so that's before I've done any

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,490
adjustment to the polls what they were

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,370
saying was going to happen and this is

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:22,730
just a point estimate the second is the

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,770
main a point estimate of the adjusted

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,050
pulse and the Purple Line there is the

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,510
actual result so you can see that not

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,339
too many of the polls particularly

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,500
before adjustment were predicting

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:36,710
anything like the coalition victory that

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,210
happened what we're trying to do is

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,040
combine these polls into a single

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,500
probability estimate of the two-party

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:46,040
preferred vote so first we've got to

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,620
specify our prior and we do that here

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,260
with our first little bit of pie MC 3ko

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,480
so pi MC 3 uses this with context to

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,589
hold its models together and keep things

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,089
consistent this means that in the same

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:02,950
yeah you can have multiple models at the

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:05,330
same time in different with contexts M

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,160
PI MC 3 comes with a bunch of

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,930
distributions inside of it one of which

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,210
is a uniform distribution and here we've

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,770
specified that the lower limit is going

00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:17,180
to be minus 1 and the upper limit is

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:20,390
going to be 1 and then I can run this so

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,800
that I can't on this goodness sorry

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,570
about that

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,570
I won't run anything more today

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:34,120
so you can see here is a representation

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:36,820
of that sampled prior so minus 1 is

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,040
where the Labour Party has one 100%

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,790
everyone in the country voted for the

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,560
Labour Party plus one is where everyone

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,790
in the country voted for the Coalition

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
and then you have all the different

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,570
possible outcomes in between and on the

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
y-axis you have the relative

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,720
probabilities of those two outcomes and

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,340
so this is our prior so we're not this

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,540
is what's called an uninformative prior

00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,220
we're not actually telling the model

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,510
anything except that the value has to

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:03,070
sit between minus 1 and 1 and we could

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,920
come up with something more informative

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,600
if we had a little birdie tell us one

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,730
thing we could specify it so that there

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,460
was more of the distribution towards the

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,870
ALP or towards the coalition but we're

00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,440
just being agnostic at this point of

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,510
saying that it's between minus 1 and 1

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,640
and then we're going to specify our

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,560
likelihood and add our data to get our

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,880
posterior distribution for the two-party

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,650
preferred margin so we've got that same

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,620
line specifying our prior and here we

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,070
put our prior into this normal

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,020
likelihood so assuming that those the

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,490
distribution is going to be normal and

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,520
that's another assumption that we're

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,620
making and then we're putting our

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,720
observed two-party preferred adjusted

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,820
here and the standard deviation as I

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,350
said before which is the weighting of

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:55,510
those different polls and here I've put

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,720
the prior and the thing to really take

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,330
note of here is how wide the x axis is

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,830
so it goes all the way from minus 1 to 1

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,110
whereas once we've updated our prior and

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:09,100
got our posterior distribution based on

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,410
the observed data this is shrunk down

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,660
markedly but it's still a distribution

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:16,870
of possible two-party preferred margins

00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,510
and I've also noted here the actual

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,100
outcome and so I would say that this is

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,350
a pretty shoddy estimate of the

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,210
two-party preferred because it doesn't

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:34,540
contain any probability distribution

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:36,740
near the actual outcome and so yeah so

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,390
I've lost my train of thought um

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,740
yeah so the question is can we take this

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,240
shoddy estimate of the two-party

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:46,039
preferred margin and use it to forecast

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,080
the number of seats that are going to be

00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:53,270
won by the two parties at the election

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,860
so we set that aside we set our polls

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,870
aside and now we're going to look at a

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,730
different data set which is historical

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,110
election results and we're going to see

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,909
is there a relationship between the

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,279
actual historical election results and

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:07,880
the number of seats that are won by the

00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,529
two major parties at an election and so

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,029
that looks like this so across the

00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:15,230
x-axis we've got the two-party preferred

00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:18,440
margin and across the y-axis we've got

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,510
the seat margin and you can see that our

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,200
democracy is working in some ways in

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,179
that the more two-party preferred margin

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,990
you win the more votes you win in a

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,230
sense the more seats you win and the

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:34,490
vice-versa also works and so if we

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,590
wanted to build a pretty straightforward

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,200
model we could fit a line of best fit

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:43,010
through those data points and come up

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,500
with a model where we can take a point

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,210
on the two-party preferred line and look

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,580
across and see what that predicts in

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,580
terms of seat margin but we're not

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,020
trying to do lines of best fit well

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,149
we're not trying to do a line of best

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,190
fit we're trying to look at the possible

00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:01,669
outcomes for those so fitting this line

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:06,350
of best fit we get a slope of 3.0 5 and

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:08,090
we get an intercept of 0.03 thinking

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,070
probabilistically though we're going to

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:13,580
go through the same process that we went

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,340
through just before specifying priors so

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,130
here we specify our price for slope for

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,020
intercept and also for the error so the

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,860
distance points can be away from that

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:30,559
line and I've used normal distributions

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,669
here for those for those distributions

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,830
there isn't I've done now there's no

00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,750
real limit on what the slope can be it

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,390
can be any real number and similarly the

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,850
intercept can be any real number an

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,419
error will be positive but it can be any

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,770
number on that line as well and so

00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,409
rather than using a uniform distribution

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,980
I've just used a really wide normal

00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,980
distribution

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,110
yeah so now we're going to specify our

00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:59,059
likelihood and add in our data so here

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,010
is our model we've got that intercept

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,110
which we've specified a prior for the

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,150
slope which we've specified a prior for

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:08,450
the actual data that runs along the

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,070
x-axis and we're calling that Y and then

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,280
we're putting Y in tell our model and

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,730
including our observed what we saw on

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:21,320
the y-axis and then we're also going to

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:24,320
estimate the error as we go along and so

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:30,799
you can see here we've got again

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:32,240
markedly shrunk x-axis which now more

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,890
representative of the data but they're

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,270
still probabilistic distributions and

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,880
the great thing you can see here is that

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,789
the mean perfectly matches our line of

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,919
best fit estimates but we have now have

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,299
probability distributions associated

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,450
with them

00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:49,460
and so what that looks like if you take

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,770
those samples and plot lines based on

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,669
each of those different samples here

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,799
I've just taken 700 is that those

00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:59,659
distributions really well match and

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,500
cover the data so where there are more

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:05,090
data points there are more lines and the

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,000
density of the lines is higher and where

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,980
there are less lines is where there are

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,409
less data points so we quite well cover

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,210
the possible outcomes in terms of this

00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:18,620
relationship between two-party preferred

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,630
margin and seat margin there's a third

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,760
section to the model that I'm not going

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:25,070
to have time to go through today and is

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,679
actually possibly it's the

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,539
best-performing bit of the model but you

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,669
have the link and so feel free to go

00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,169
along and to see how it works but it's

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:35,809
just going through that same process of

00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,190
specifying a prior adding a data and

00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,230
some likelihood here we use a different

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,480
likelihood which is a binomial

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,890
likelihood and then getting a posterior

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,039
distribution for the number of seats

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,409
that will be won by the cross bench so

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,000
we've gone from poles to the two-party

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,130
preferred vote and then we've also gone

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,110
from the two-party preferred vote to the

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,710
number of seats but we have to combine

00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,110
those two models together and this is

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,600
that what I showed you at the start so

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,940
again we've got the model for the two

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,890
party

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,290
preferred margin the model for the

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,680
relationship between the two-party

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,600
preferred margin and the number of seats

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,000
and here is the I guess really

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,230
interesting or exciting part is that

00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,230
we've got things estimated from

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,090
different sets of data so the intercept

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,430
and slope which have been estimated from

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,810
historical election results and the

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,310
two-party preferred margin which has

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,690
been estimated from polls and we're

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,060
bringing those things together

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,880
in a probabilistic way and not losing

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,700
any of our uncertainty along the way and

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,710
we've also got our error in that linear

00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,930
relationship that we're including here

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,580
so we're combining we have uncertainty

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,220
in all those different parameters and

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,500
we're bringing all those pieces of

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,830
uncertainty together and kind of making

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,710
sure we don't lose any along the way and

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,270
so this gives us an estimate of the seat

00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,850
margin between the two parties as a

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,120
percentage and then the rest from here

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:08,340
on down is really just math so we have

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,690
151 seats we give those seats that we're

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,070
going to give away to the cross bench

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,820
that's the bit that I didn't show you

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,740
and then we just it's quite generally

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,990
just math that I won't go through but to

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,730
determine the number of seats in the

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,810
Liberal National Party and the

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,010
Longborough of seats in the ILP and

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,570
here's what we get at the end so we get

00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,020
an estimate of the number of seats the

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,970
ILP will win you can see of course I was

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,130
a little bit high on the number of seats

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,560
of the old people wing but certainly

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,860
that estimate is within the what's

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,670
called the credible interval the

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,350
equivalent of like an 80 percent

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,040
confidence interval but not quite the

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,260
same thing

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,570
so that estimate is well within the that

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,400
range similarly the number of seats that

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:54,150
the Liberal National Coalition would win

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,850
that estimate was a little bit low but

00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,990
within that range and the cross bench

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,450
was pretty much bang on so I possibly

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,440
one takeaway is that you can have

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,910
polling data that gives you a pretty

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,210
porous and that of the two-party

00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,460
preferred margin but if you try and

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,110
include uncertainty of other parts of

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,130
the system you can still get a

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,250
reasonable estimate of what might happen

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:23,420
and you're not limiting yourself to one

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,610
possible outcome one thing that you're

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,820
probably all asking is well what kind of

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,930
percentages did you have on those final

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,270
absolute outcomes of different things

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,340
happening so we had a and you can

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,510
calculate these super easily from the

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,350
samples that you get spit out of pi MC 3

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:45,320
we had a 25% chance of a coalition win

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:47,240
35% chance of an AOP win and close to a

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,640
40% chance of the minority government

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,670
and certainly I wouldn't argue that we

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,460
predicted a coalition win but when

00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:59,410
something has a 25% likelihood it's the

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:03,410
same as guessing the correct answer in a

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,150
multiple-choice test it's not far off it

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:09,680
raining on a day when there's a 30%

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:12,050
chance of rain sometimes something other

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,790
than the most likely thing happens and I

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,070
think this is one of those instances but

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,980
it's important to be aware of well it's

00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,080
still certainly possible because 25%

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,760
chance isn't zero chance and it's not

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,380
10% chance so that's one of my main

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,470
takeaways thank you very much for

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,470
listening

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:42,320
thank you for that great talk Martin we

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:44,600
got time for one maybe two questions I

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,680
noticed in your first prior it looked a

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,390
little wobbly

00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,330
I wouldn't we expect a flat distribution

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,710
if we're not making any assumptions

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,630
definitely so like because I was going

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,940
to try and run it I just use a really

00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,120
small number of samples and so that's

00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:03,920
why it's really wobbly but when I run it

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,360
live I do 180 odd instead of six 180,000

00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,340
on samples instead of six thousand

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,850
samples and so that line just really

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,850
flattens out

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:27,649
um there are some other Python MC MC

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,679
packages like PI Stan have you used

00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:33,500
those and do you have any ideas of which

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:40,070
which ones are more workable and I don't

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:44,450
this was my first foray into using MC

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:46,190
packages for newcomers though I really

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,889
do recommend so I built the whole model

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,539
using this think base framework from

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:53,090
Allen Downey which is just a great way

00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:57,350
to get your head around Bayesian

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:59,120
statistics and and that that doesn't

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:03,649
have Markov chain Monte Carlo in it it

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,539
does that you build all the architecture

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,610
yourself so that's a really great way to

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,230
get introduced then if you want to get

00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,450
introduced to PI MC 3 you can have a

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,620
look at Bayesian methods but I'm sorry I

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,970
don't see your question I don't know

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,960
between PI Stan and PI MC 3 so first of

00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:21,379
all thank you very much for your

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:28,970
presentation so do you have any advice

00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:30,919
of about choosing priors I I don't I've

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,139
read a little bit about it people say

00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,600
that are like informative priors are

00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:37,879
better when you have an opinion I just

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,679
took the view like it's it's pretty

00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:44,539
clear that these things that yeah maybe

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,559
you can set limits on them so

00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,149
particularly the two-party preferred

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:49,190
margin it's pretty clear that it can be

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:50,539
minus 1 or it can be 1 but it has to be

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,490
somewhere in between that range so

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,259
that's a pretty standard thing the great

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,600
thing about prize is two people can have

00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:58,639
different priors put them both into a

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,669
model and you can see what impact your

00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:08,120
assumptions have on the actual end point

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:09,620
which is great sorry no more time for

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,690
questions but I'm sure you can find

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,220
Martin and wonder breaks and ask him

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,180
some more so thank you again thanks

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,240
thank you very much

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,240
