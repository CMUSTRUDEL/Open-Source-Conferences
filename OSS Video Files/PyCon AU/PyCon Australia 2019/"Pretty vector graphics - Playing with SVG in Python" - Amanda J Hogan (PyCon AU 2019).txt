testing testing hello hello hello it's

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,110
11:50 which means that it is time to

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,790
make some art so welcome to the pretty

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,710
vector graphics playing with SVG

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,300
in Python session I'm just gonna do a

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,019
quick intro and then hand it over to

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,460
Amanda J Hogan who's a speaker yeah yeah

00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:28,500
and very quickly

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,170
computing education specialists at the

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,090
ACA and the president of ICT in New

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,480
South Wales which is a professional

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,950
association for computing teachers

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,460
secondary computing teacher for about 10

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,980
years

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,120
it's like a dossier and has come to

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,410
teaching after working in the IT

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,539
industry most recently at Microsoft

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,860
Australia and Amanda is an active tutor

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,480
and content creator in the girls

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,850
programming network let's give her

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,920
another round of applause good morning

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,350
I'm gonna need to do some audience

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,489
warm-up so now I'm gonna be showing some

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,970
stuff today and I need a lot of ooh so

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:08,610
can I get a practice in please oh very

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,270
good okay this is going to be fine I'm

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,990
not at all terrified okay so a couple of

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,400
months ago I decided to play around with

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,280
SVG and I'll tell you a little bit more

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,140
about that story but why SVG at PyCon a

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,860
lot of people said surely you should be

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,250
talking about this with JavaScript X XML

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,829
is text SVG is XML and Python is quite

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,110
good at text manipulation and also I

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,990
know Python and feel kind of confident

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,130
in the in the basic stuff so I wanted to

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,549
play around with something that I was

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,899
familiar with and if strings fantastic

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,930
made my life heaps easy okay so a couple

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,950
of months ago maybe six life is flying

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,680
by me

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,720
my friend Ben Taylor went to a

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,329
JavaScript conference and learned from

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Tim Holland all about making generative

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,670
art with JavaScript and he was using

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
canvas and so we have a learning group

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,320
at work I recommend you should get a

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,629
learning group and so Ben was showing

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,190
what he'd learned at a conference to the

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,390
rest of the team and we were having a

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,050
play with javascript in canvas

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,240
and generative art based on Tim's talk

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,970
and so I'm referencing both of these

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,630
people as inspiration for where I went

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,620
from there I decided that SVG was

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,350
something that I was really interested

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,970
in playing with and so I moved from

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:36,160
JavaScript canvas to SVG in Python

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,320
okay so what's generative art it's where

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,730
you take a computer and you let you do

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,610
the creative stuff because you're not

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,410
creative and that was great for me

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,970
because I am a copier I am NOT a

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,040
creative person I don't come up with

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,360
amazing things out of thin air but

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,200
computers do randomness does

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,000
pseudo-random is great so you take your

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,250
pseudo randomness you take a whole bunch

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,470
of repetition and you take an algorithm

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,120
or something and it makes a design and

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,650
it's been around since the 60s

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:09,250
this drawing is actually done with ink

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,320
on paper it's done with a plotter by

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,590
Frederick nake there was a huge movement

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,390
of generative art from the 60s and it's

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,330
it's getting pretty wild out there now

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,000
but this is where the simple stuff

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,090
started with just shapes and polygons

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,459
and that's kind of where I came from so

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,959
first step you need to know how to draw

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,640
a line I didn't want to use any

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,880
libraries I wanted to know what the heck

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,090
I was doing so I use just string

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,980
manipulation so we have here the

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,290
building blocks of making a line I've

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,049
given you a couple of code snippets at

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,420
the end I have the github repository

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:50,890
where I've put everything you're welcome

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:55,989
to steal hack remake improve please

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:58,390
improve okay so a line has an X starting

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,459
point and a y starting point and an X

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,489
ending point and a y ending point and

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,280
some kind of styling so a stroke with

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,650
the stroke color and that's basically

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,769
what you need to make a line and if you

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,820
make it randomly from top left to bottom

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,620
right or from bottom left to top right

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,780
then when you repeat it a bunch of times

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,090
you end up with this and you've all

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:25,560
practice so right

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,140
okay so repeating stuff a whole bunch of

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,670
times makes this makes really

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,890
interesting patterns and they and each

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:35,250
time you run it it changes so you get

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:38,880
this lovely yeah generic effect

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,230
generated effect sorry okay so once

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,900
you've worked out how to draw a line

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,660
this is good we've made a start so we're

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,610
going to move on to basic shapes and the

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,060
most basic shape is a rectangle or

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,490
square and so it starts from an XY

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,260
coordinate and then has a width in a

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,990
height and you can make that I've made

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,690
it a square when with equals height but

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,490
you can make it a rectangle and you have

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,080
a color you also have a stroke I have I

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,200
wouldn't usually have put a stroke width

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,600
that was the same color as the fill

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,660
strokes can get really wacky and in

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,410
behavior when you do scaling on SVG the

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,820
stroke scale in in an unpredictable way

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,680
so when you're doing massive scaling

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,020
things I would definitely not use a

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,430
stroke but in this case when you repeat

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,970
a whole lot of rectangles next to each

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,370
other you get a shadow line like a tiny

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,650
micro gap between them and it looked

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,440
kind of ugly so I put the stroke in just

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,630
so that I could fill that gap so then I

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,940
went and analyzed a whole bunch of

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,560
Mondrian art I don't know if you know

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,670
the black and the white and the red and

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,190
blue and yellow and I did a Markov chain

00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,170
I was playing around with some

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,140
algorithms did a Markov chain that

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,390
didn't work all that well but then I

00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,630
plotted all of the colors used in a

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,000
Mondrian piece of art and how big that

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,310
length was of each rectangle and then I

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,200
made a dictionary of this is just

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,150
explaining the craziness in the code if

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,590
you ever go to the github there's a

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,480
dictionary of a whole lot of numbers

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,610
those numbers are the lengths of

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,940
rectangles coming from somewhere there's

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,040
an analysis of an artwork and so you

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,380
feed that back in and then the computer

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,920
can make their own it's our own artwork

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,370
based on all of those numbers thank you

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,010
well done you're very well trained okay

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,680
so after you've got rectangles and moved

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,639
on to circles and so circles are

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,479
actually very simple they have

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,689
Center X Center Y and a radius and so

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,080
this is just my way of making multiple

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,849
concentric circles where you have the

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,979
center X and Center Y doesn't change but

00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:55,719
the radius does on a random thing and

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,310
there's s W is stroke with almost I'm

00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:00,039
almost consistent throughout all

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,439
everything I do and it's almost Pepe

00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,949
throughout everything I've tried really

00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,020
hard and so it takes a random choice but

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,150
it's weighted so that there's more ones

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,400
and then there are twos and more twos

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,599
and there are threes and so once you do

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,389
that and then you steal somebody's

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,580
excellent circle packing algorithm with

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:23,110
credit of course then you end up with

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,430
this yeah so it gets more complex we're

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,000
starting from the basics of moving

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,310
through ok arcs are really unpredictable

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,430
I didn't realize how tricky arcs work

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,680
until I started playing around with them

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,169
so an arc is an intersection between a

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,979
curve and a line and when you have a

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:45,069
curve and a line which has it has a

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:48,039
radius width and a radius height so you

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,719
can make an oval as well as a circle you

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,729
have four different arcs that can be

00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:54,610
created from that curve line combination

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:58,240
and so do you want this one or this one

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,699
or this one or this one there are two

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,400
flags that are ones or zeros based on

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,460
which one you want and I quite liked

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,400
that I had the large arc flag and the

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,680
small arc flag being large AF and small

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,839
a if that made me giggle just a little

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:19,629
bit okay so that makes an arc and when

00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,629
you take lots of arcs and repeat it you

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:24,460
get this cool thing yeah this is

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,289
probably one of my least favorites I I

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,250
don't think it's quite exactly what I

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:32,019
was looking for but I wanted to move on

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,329
to other things so I'll come back and

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:38,140
look at arcs another day

00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:42,390
all right path arcs are paths but paths

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,690
are the most manipulatable of all of the

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:50,560
tools in your SVG toolkit and paths can

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,870
get pretty complex so I recommend you go

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,710
and read up on all of the different bits

00:08:52,870 --> 00:09:02,110
that you can set in a path I'm using C

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:06,940
which is a cubic Bezier curve and C

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:09,310
capital C the way SVG path encoding

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,690
works is that you start with M which is

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:16,000
a starting point and then C means curve

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,980
if it's a lowercase C it means relative

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,470
positioning and if it's an uppercase C

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,029
it's absolute positioning and I wanted

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,220
to just do everything absolute reven

00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:26,550
trying to work out the relatives when

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,770
you use something like Inkscape or

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,740
illustrator it tends to create SVG's

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,170
that are much more relative so that you

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,550
can move one point and the whole thing

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:44,170
moves yeah I didn't want to do the maths

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:46,690
so what this is this is just a JPEG from

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,830
the internet it shows you that this is

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:55,630
not really a circle this is for cubic

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:58,510
curves that approximate a circle so what

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,310
I did for this one is take a circle plot

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,740
twelve points on it turn each of those

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,050
points into a cubic curve rather than an

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,520
arc so that I could manipulate them

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,240
individually so you can then manipulate

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,330
the point themselves and the handles and

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,430
so twelve points 12 handles twelve sets

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,530
of handles all manipulated you get this

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,690
weed wiggly thing that's randomly

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,070
manipulated and mean if you repeat that

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,660
a bunch of times you end up with this

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,700
this is one of my favorites my daughter

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,240
wants to turn it on its side and draw a

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,240
face on it

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,880
yeah so just that lovely hairiness as it

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,420
moves across the screen is fantastic if

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,630
you were manipulating SVG in JavaScript

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,730
you could definitely animate this which

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,470
is quite cool too

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,670
okay so now that I've got some random

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:54,190
started I took a field of quadrilaterals

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,800
that these are actual squares and then I

00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:01,900
manipulated each of the points of those

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,089
squares randomly so I've actually made

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,800
sure that each point is kind of stuck

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,850
the point that it's attached that it's

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,249
um adjacent to so once you manipulate

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,790
each of those points and I wanted the

00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:20,139
border to remain the same then you end

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,490
up with this wonderful tiled mosaic so

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:23,079
this is the first time you'll see that

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,410
I've added color I'm not a confident

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:29,139
color person and so I actually consulted

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,470
with my child Oh Oh what were the best

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,420
colors to use there are lots of ways to

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,670
import color into things please don't

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,639
use random color random color is just

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,930
almost universally bad and a different

00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:46,689
shade of brown so you should that purple

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,300
Brown does exist you should you should

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:51,160
go and find an API for some wonderful

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,769
color schemes that real people that know

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,749
how color works have put together and

00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:01,329
steal those okay so once I had moved

00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:04,029
from mucking around with randomness

00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:06,249
randomness starts to look a little

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,809
random and the reason this doesn't look

00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:12,429
like a mess is because I've got the

00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,870
border stationary so from here I was

00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:16,300
starting to think about how I could use

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,319
randomness and still have it look pretty

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,600
I have a look like it makes sense so if

00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:25,870
you have a bunch of random lines but

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,029
then you reflect them on symmetrical

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,339
axes then it starts to look like it

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:33,209
makes sense like it's a pattern and so

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:36,550
this one this set of lines can be

00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:39,610
reflected diagonally and then for four

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,129
different quadrants and I did that to

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:46,209
make this kind of thing these don't

00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:47,889
match exactly because they're because

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:51,339
it's randomly generated each time and I

00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,740
didn't lock the seeds and so then when

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,819
you do that a bunch of times

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,819
people might have noticed that I tweeted

00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:00,399
this one out on Twitter thank you

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:03,610
I'm quite pleased with this it looks a

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,350
little like space invaders the one that

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,679
does look a lot like space invaders is

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,709
if you do the same thing with circles so

00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:14,230
this is a randomly generated same thing

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:18,110
of series of circles and then are

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:21,740
diagonally and eight points of symmetry

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,660
and you end up with that and so each of

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,790
these pieces of code you can choose

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,730
those sort of that how many tiles you

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:34,339
want and just have one or have many okay

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,380
so once I've mucked around with basic

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,839
shapes and repetition a little bit of

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,589
randomness I wanted to have a play with

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,910
other images so there's a fantastic

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,250
library I didn't use any of the

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,370
libraries for SVG but I did use a

00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:52,820
library called pillow for reading the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,890
pixels in an image so for this one I

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,529
decided to split it into a grid of four

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:01,579
and then I did some calculations this

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,550
get average color function runs through

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:06,230
all of the pixels in that quadrant and

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,180
determines the average color for the

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,480
quadrant and then looks at the center

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,670
color and determines the distance

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,360
between the average color and the center

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,760
color the highest distance is the one

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,890
that has the most changes happening in

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,839
that quadrant so then it does the same

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,269
thing again in that quadrant and the

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,570
same thing again until I get to a small

00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:32,540
small radius which I've just arbitrarily

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:38,050
said and so this this lovely picture of

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:42,350
a flower turns into this fantastic thing

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:45,199
and this one you can definitely still

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,570
see that the Joker's existed in this one

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,449
I quite like that abstract nature of

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,779
these ones and if you've wonder what a

00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:59,060
zebra looks like the answer is not like

00:14:53,779 --> 00:15:00,440
a zebra yeah but it does I can't sit

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,269
with some nice things and if I use

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,910
symmetry on these as well then you'd end

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,459
up with a really nice tiling but I just

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,370
wanted to see using seeds other than my

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:13,029
own geometric interest or randomness

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,790
what I could do with that

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,500
okay so then where we move on to

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,140
algorithms so this is a pretty

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,550
straightforward drawing a tree program

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,750
there's a little bit of difference in

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:29,750
that I manipulate the HSL value based on

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,440
the level I'm at in the tree so you'll

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,960
see that it fades to

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
towards the top you can use all of the

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,580
different color systems in SVG which is

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:45,570
quite nice so this one then repeated

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,340
maybe 36 times and done with this I like

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:52,110
that it looks like saurons eye or

00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:55,440
something and so that that's the

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,920
repetition and the HSL value is what

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,030
makes that I think and then this was

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:06,630
this is a personal just a goal of mine

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:10,080
to understand chaos a little bit not a

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:13,250
lot just a little bit and so I saw

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,860
people had taken logistic Maps

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:22,020
bifurcating logistic maps awful things

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:24,150
in maths and they suit this is actually

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,210
a turn of a logistic map because a

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,680
logistic map goes that way but I thought

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,690
it was really pretty and looked a bit

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,460
like a mountain range

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:38,730
that's how mathy I am and so took some

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,900
data processing to get to this point but

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,980
between two different values the

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,900
bifurcating logistic map gets quite

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,140
chaotic and so that's what I get and

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:54,600
then I rotated it okay so algorithms and

00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:59,430
then we're up to this is a happy

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:04,740
accident I completely failed to get my

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:07,439
double pendulum to work and gravity was

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:11,130
not working for me but it was very

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:15,030
pretty so I kept the double pendulum

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,910
fail program and you put in different

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:20,430
numbers and you get these amazing almost

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,140
under the sea type creatures and that's

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,900
the great thing about generative art is

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,780
that accidents are actually to be

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,600
celebrated that's how you get the the

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,310
uniqueness that's how you get the

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,130
creativity is finding little accidents

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,380
so this is a an anatomy of a failure I

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,440
did actually finally get my double

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,900
pendulum to work and so it's not quite

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,400
generative art because it's not really

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,120
random it's going to be the same every

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,500
time I run it

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,690
unless I put in different starting

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:55,559
points but nevertheless I did get the

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,780
double pendulum to work so this is my

00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,309
double pendulum it's about to be

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,660
revealed so you get yours ready

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:06,960
okay so this last experiment is playing

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:11,550
with the filtering that I can do styling

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,559
in SVG and you can style in CSS with SVG

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,670
which is really useful if you're doing

00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:19,290
it on for the web but I wanted to play

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,630
around with the internal styling because

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:25,640
with strokes you really don't have a lot

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:29,190
of choice in CSS styling so this is

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,790
using some blurring to make kind of a

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,860
glow effect and there's my double

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:39,390
pendulum thank you very much all right

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:43,740
so what can I do with all of that

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,540
well it's SVG is great for the web some

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,300
of the things that I made particularly

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:51,630
the ones that have a lot of circles are

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:54,240
way too big don't use them you want to

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,550
make your SVG is small and generally

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,910
they're smaller than high high

00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,860
resolution images but they tend to be if

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,220
you put too many shapes in they just get

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,170
huge you'd think that using a shape

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,230
defining it as a symbol and using that a

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,010
lot of times would make it smaller no it

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,890
makes it bigger

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,880
not sure not sure why maybe we should

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:20,760
get onto that but yes so you can make

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,490
impossibly big SVG's don't use them on

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,040
the web but for making banners and

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,530
backgrounds and things that are unique

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,390
to you but kind of makes sense and

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,970
they're pretty I think they're really

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,480
nice they're scalable so that if you

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,340
have a responsive design then then it

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,460
will work on all the different sizes you

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,720
can make scalable logos so that when you

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,940
make it for a business card or for a

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,820
poster beside a train station then they

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,170
can be the same image infographics are

00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,230
really good lots of people are using

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,870
SVG's for infographics and you can use

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,800
make it make a character using something

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,980
generative and

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,340
then animate it for games or for just

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,280
basic animations and finally my friend

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,200
Gavin Smith is here and he and I have

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,780
hung out a little bit at robots and

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:17,130
dinosaurs and so most laser engraver

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:20,730
programs talk SVG so he's actually done

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,900
some stuff with Mandelbrot and this is

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,040
you can come up and have a look at these

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:31,140
when it's ended and this is a laser

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,030
engraved Sydney sunset and Twilight

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,060
mapping so you can see the three

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,460
different definitions of Twilight and

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,770
when sunset falls below the horizon and

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,560
we have a larger version mapped with

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,650
with the phases of the Moon and so all

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,200
of this is SVG that's been built using

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,640
the maths in Python so that you don't

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,480
have to do it yourself in Illustrator

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,890
because that would make you cry okay so

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,670
you can have a look at the show until

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:05,700
after this is done and so go forth and

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:08,010
make all of my github all of my code is

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,560
on this github repo and you can reach me

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,720
at Twitter and I'd really like to see

00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,480
anything you you make because I follow

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,350
quite a lot of generative art on Twitter

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:25,190
and that's it for me today thank you

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:26,940
[Applause]

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,650
we got a little bit of time for

00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,650
questions anybody have some questions

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,870
how did you get started that's cuz I'm

00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,670
comprehensive know like what what gave

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,690
you the bug or what what gave you the

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,560
bug for this like such a cool

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,150
application of Python yeah it really was

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,320
mucking around with canvas in JavaScript

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,340
and feeling really out of my depth

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,370
because I don't really understand

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:56,030
JavaScript and then going you know I've

00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:00,590
been doing a project with SVG's at work

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:04,020
and I've been in manipulating them in

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:07,650
you know but by dragging dots points

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,870
around in in a vector illustration

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,370
program and finding it really

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,550
frustrating and didn't even really

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,170
consider that I could just build the

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,780
text with the numbers and stop mucking

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:22,290
around with my mouse which saves a lot

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:28,430
of time that's not cool

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:28,430
come on got those questions you gonna I

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,940
was wondering if there's anything that

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,260
you're working on now that you haven't

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,700
quite managed to get working yet or you

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,830
if there's a bunch that kind of fell

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:48,180
into the onto the drawing-room floor

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:49,740
just as as I don't know manipulating the

00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,380
numbers they didn't quite come out the

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,930
way that I was expecting I quite like

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,240
the stuff from the 70s that so there's a

00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,520
big like there's books of of generative

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,980
art done on plotters back then and so I

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,680
I really liked that I wanted to start

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,960
moving into making some physical stuff

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,020
so rather than just doing the SVG moving

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,780
on to the laser engraver or even using a

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,700
plotter and making it on paper I think

00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,700
that's quite a nice beautiful thing

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,650
so as you've explored this amazing space

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,140
of generative art have there been any

00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,940
particular tools or libraries that you

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,860
were like wow I wish someone had built

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,240
that why haven't they built that yet and

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,539
if so what would those do Wow okay so

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,750
the thing that I've kind of ignored in

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,000
my exploration of generative art I

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,669
really enjoyed the stuff that was

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,890
definitely lines and shapes because I

00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:59,960
could I could see my way into how to do

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,510
that but there's there's a lot of

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,559
generative art that's not really related

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:11,059
to SVG that is done with pixel brushing

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,850
and these amazing sweeps of color that I

00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:17,510
think would be so good to be able to

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,870
find a way to manipulate that with with

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,820
you know just coming up with your own

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,860
inputs and having that the outputs just

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:29,750
appear in front of you I'd really like

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:31,490
to take this and move it into I've had a

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,010
play with moving it into repli'd and

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:37,490
that's probably relates to your question

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,929
to Kelly that I'd like to make it more

00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,169
interactive so that you're not just

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:45,230
running a bunch of functions with inputs

00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:47,570
but actually just changing numbers on a

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,950
webpage and having the SVG appear in

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,399
front of you that's kind of cool too

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:56,260
that's probably the next step that would

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,260
be it would be nice for me to make that

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:17,390
so much Brown in the world

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:19,610
oh I've not heard of that

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:23,150
most people I know use ap eyes that are

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,220
made by actual people so that would be

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,990
really interesting to talk about a bit

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,440
more detail a bit later what you're

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,440
doing at lunch

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:45,250
have you met Gavin I'm sorry I get

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,250
nervous I go fast

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,200
I can repeat the question back

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:12,129
so you mentioned animations have you

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,389
done this with animations at all I'm

00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:14,409
just kind of curious because that seems

00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:18,039
like it'd be a whole different world

00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:20,860
yeah so not with Python it doesn't it

00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:25,059
doesn't make a lot of sense but I have

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:27,539
made things SVG's with Python and then

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:30,820
animated them using a CSS yes absolutely

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,830
you group things together and then you

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,070
can set the keyframes it's actually

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:39,269
really nice and like a ferris wheel for

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,679
example just spinning on on a banner is

00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:42,399
really simple to do and looks really

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,549
impressive

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,239
I might have one more question after

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:55,299
this okay so you talked about generative

00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:57,190
art yes and in your initial description

00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:59,350
you you steer clear of using ideas

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,659
because you want to discover SVG and

00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,700
that's it's very technical but how do

00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:06,279
you feel about using libraries when art

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,440
is a creative processes that's different

00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,869
some of the creativity is is the art

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,279
itself generating the algorithms so

00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:16,690
that's a really interesting question I'm

00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:18,789
not a purist I just I just wanted to

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,710
understand how the building blocks of

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:25,359
SVG rather than just sending it to a to

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,340
a method so I think absolutely from here

00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,919
I would be using things that had been

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,289
built by people more expert than me to

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,749
play with because it gives you more

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:39,309
opportunity you're not so bugged down in

00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:42,369
oh my goodness off by one errors so many

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:44,700
so really and so you're not so bogged

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:48,519
down in that and you're just exploring

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,789
what different settings allow you to do

00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,419
I think that's much more exciting for

00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:57,220
that from the artistic perspective yep

00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,399
awesome anybody have a last question

00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,399
then

00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:10,959
thanks great presentation generating SVG

00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:12,939
programmatically often there are syntax

00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:15,789
errors that sort of thing is there

00:28:12,939 --> 00:28:21,999
anything you'd recommend for linting SVG

00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:25,929
that's generating in this way the

00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:27,429
process that I used myself for finding

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:31,989
out what the heck was wrong with an SVG

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:36,849
when it didn't work was to like I would

00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:39,129
make something in Inkscape and then open

00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,479
the one that's generated by the actual

00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,779
graphic program that knows what it's

00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:43,239
doing

00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:45,039
and then open mine and kind of play

00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:49,469
compare there isn't really something

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:52,689
that does lint SVG as far as I could see

00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:55,329
because a lot of people that are coming

00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:57,549
from that creating space aren't really

00:28:55,329 --> 00:29:00,309
interested in the syntax they just want

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,079
the so they use the package to do it for

00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,339
them

00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,299
but that would be really interesting

00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:07,049
that that would be an interesting

00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:07,049
project yeah

00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,970
yeah and with that it sounds like

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,590
there's gonna be an amazing discussion

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,730
come lunch right yeah so just like that

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,850
can we please get one more round of

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:28,869
applause big thank you

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,869
