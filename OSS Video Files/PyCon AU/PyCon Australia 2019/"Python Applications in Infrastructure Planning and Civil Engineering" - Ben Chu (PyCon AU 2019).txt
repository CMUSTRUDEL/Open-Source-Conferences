Description: 
	Ben Chu

Engineers tasked with planning new infrastructure constantly face the problem of having to look through too much information. This talk is about how we wanted to be lazy and wrote a bot to do it for us instead.

all right welcome to our after lunch

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,839
session we've got we've got been here

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,580
been true talking about Python

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:27,689
applications in infrastructure planning

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:29,119
and civil engineering get started thanks

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,130
for coming guys

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,570
so a little bit about myself this is my

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,570
first pike on may you and it's crazy

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:43,079
that I've only been on my Python journey

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,110
for a year my background is in

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,670
electrical engineering I realized that

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,719
I'm quite a bit different from the

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,539
dominant demographic here in that my

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,870
background is in in computer science so

00:00:53,539 --> 00:01:00,030
please go easy on me so at the moment

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,710
I'm working as a graduate engineer in

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,780
the WSP here in Sydney so who are the

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,210
VSP and what do we do we are one of the

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,799
world's largest engineering firms with

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,400
about 44,000 employees worldwide in 500

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,990
550 offices across 40 countries we also

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,000
have a software engineering department

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,780
based in Melbourne called obviously

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,909
digital but our small team of about five

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,880
engineers in a data analytics and

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,790
automation team sits in our transport

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,570
business group so we mostly deal with

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,720
large infrastructure projects such as

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:43,409
the Newcastle and para maana light rail

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,560
and sydney metro that includes the newly

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,990
opened metro northwest and we were also

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,310
working on the Metro West and Metro city

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,409
in South West so to give you a bit of an

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,950
background on what goes into railway

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:03,420
planning first of all we conduct a

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,680
feasibility assessment so it's done to

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,590
ensure that we're not committing to a

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,319
project that is not feasible at all so

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,910
you don't want to commit about say 10

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,580
billion dollars into a project and then

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:19,120
find out down the way that you need to

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:25,150
spend twenty billion dollars more so

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:28,080
that goes into a business case to secure

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,880
funding from a federal government and

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,520
with that proof we go into a concept

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,340
design phase which is a higher level

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,310
design and after that we go into detail

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,280
design so all the really specific

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,200
details are designs such as the exact

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,830
location of the tracks and stuff like

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,820
that so in a feasibility assessment

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:54,070
phase we look at many factors including

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,160
socio-economic so whether that railway

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,800
will bring improvements to that area is

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,350
it an is it economically viable or is it

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,140
going to just be sucking in taxpayers

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,570
money we also look at technical factors

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,150
so such as whether it's possible to

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,360
build a bridge or would it be better or

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,910
easier to build a tunnel across under

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,890
the hub instead and then there's the

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,730
environmental factors which will look

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:25,990
into shortly and also a lot more things

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,060
that we have to consider so what is

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,280
involved in the environmental impact

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,920
assessment well some of the things that

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,130
we look at include national parks

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,680
because we want to avoid doing that to

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,420
them these people aren't going to be

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,470
happy we also look at floodplains

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:50,610
because you don't want to build a

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:53,710
railway across a flood plain look at

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,590
sensor noise receivers such as hospitals

00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,960
places of worship and schools this is

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,530
due to regulations and legislations

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,650
stating a maximum allowable allowable

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,440
noise for both construction and

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,050
operation phases afterwards so we have

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,300
to be careful with that we also look at

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,060
wetlands as they are also protected by

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,380
legislation and some of the other things

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,650
that we look at include crown land

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,870
because well their crown lands are

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,310
government owned lands and also by the

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,150
crown

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:32,319
so it could it's hard to obtain those

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,780
lands for our users we also look at

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:39,699
ecology items such such as vegetation

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,250
maps and threatened species contaminated

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:47,770
lands are also assessed since they can

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:50,169
be costly to mitigate so the

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,590
conventional method of doing this

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:56,229
assessment is to get junior staff aka

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,770
interns to look through maps identifying

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,099
and quantifying these risky items along

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:06,280
the alignment so what is an alignment

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:08,770
alignment is the physical route that the

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,590
railway will take place so as you can

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,080
see that black line is a potential

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,800
alignment from Newcastle which is in the

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,300
bottom to Port Macquarie

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,180
so let's look at some data sets that

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,930
these interns will be looking through so

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,740
sensitive north receivers it's quite

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,770
sparse so it's not too hard to for them

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,889
to identify them along the way but if we

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:41,979
look at the vegetation data set so that

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:44,710
there is about 50,000 polygons it's it

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,900
looks quite hard and then this is

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,860
another vegetation that I said that's

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,599
about 200,000 polygons there if we zoom

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:59,469
in by 130 times that's why it looks like

00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:02,740
that red line across there is about 360

00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:05,020
metres across so the straight line

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,099
distance from Newcastle to Port

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,979
Macquarie is about 200 kilometers and so

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:15,310
we're looking at a really rough estimate

00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:18,069
of 500 something polygons that it

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,099
crosses through so the challenges face

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:24,610
here is that it takes a long time for a

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,289
person to look through all those so if

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,229
it takes a long time it costs a lot of

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:33,399
money errors are made really easily and

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:35,740
it's boring and also due to the rapid

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,100
changes in alignments when we're doing

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,190
these designs

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,680
alignments can be set today and tomorrow

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,920
it's going to be different the day after

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,770
it's going to be different again so

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,300
because of this we've wanted to come up

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,970
with something that automates this

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,830
pipeline work so we came up with this

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,770
pipeline to quickly a great abrogate

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,120
these thorough sets which environmental

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,520
planners can then spend their time

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,070
assessing it instead of looking at maps

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,870
and recording results on to excel at the

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,050
heart of this pipeline is a jupiter

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,060
notebook template so for those of you

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,350
who are unfamiliar which I'm sure most

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,710
of you are

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:25,340
tributon notebooks integrates

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:28,040
development of code and output and it

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:34,460
combines code plain text mathematical

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:38,450
equations and visualizations so we we

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:41,210
format it this notebook so that we can

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,430
hide all the code cells and the

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,560
environmental team can look at it just

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,470
like a report document that they would

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:55,640
read but it really facilitates their

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:59,530
ease of access to data so we feed an

00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,570
alignment shape file into this notebook

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,700
shape files are pretty much spreadsheet

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:09,560
and tabular data with the geometry or

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:12,830
geographic data so this geometry can be

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,820
in a form of points or lines or polygons

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:21,800
so as we've seen earlier that's what a

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:24,140
point based geometry looks like so each

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,410
of those points could contain attributes

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,650
such as school ID school name school

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:35,780
type so any form of thought up pretty

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,380
much and then you have polygons as we've

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,630
seen before

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,570
so each polygon here you see is a patch

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,050
of unique vegetation type it could be

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:49,250
say some endangered endangered

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,420
vegetation or it could be cleared

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,360
already

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,889
so obviously endangered vegetation is

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,760
going to pose a high risk to your land

00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:01,430
and because it will be hard for you to

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:08,600
get permission from the government to

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:14,360
clear that land so this is what the

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:16,880
alignment shapefile looks like so we

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,260
feed that into the Drupal notebook using

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,139
paper mill paper mill was a tool for

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,529
parameter parameter rising and executing

00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:29,000
Jupiter notebooks we use it to feed our

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,500
Jupiter notebook template with the

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,449
correct data sets alignments and

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,839
different parameters and then we use it

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,910
to sort of to execute it as well we also

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,850
use the Python markdown preprocessor

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,120
during execution to allow displaying

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,850
output produced by the current kernel in

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,889
markdown cells so essentially it just

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,130
helps it to make this makes it easier

00:09:51,889 --> 00:10:01,910
for people reading the output document

00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:04,940
to process the information so the kind

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,540
of outputs that we export includes a

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,029
HTML document so it is pretty much in

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,160
the form of a environmental impact

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,519
assessment report that they will usually

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,480
generate so they can look through that

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,060
and it includes summary tables that

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,680
looks like that and interactive maps

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,550
where they can zoom in and look at

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,820
different items along the alignment for

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:35,660
further assessment more detailed

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,899
assessment we also output spreadsheets

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,680
in the form of CSV files and Excel

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:45,529
spreadsheets so that's where they can

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:50,290
delve deeper into the data and also

00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:52,880
shape files so it can be uploaded onto

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:58,459
visualization apps for the client to

00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:01,220
look at so onto the next part

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,589
scraping and risk rating development

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,080
applications so what a development

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,390
application

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,580
so in New South Wales any non in

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,010
significant changes to properties must

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,100
be first approved by council or the

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,160
state government so these changes could

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,750
range from adding new fencing to your

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:26,180
house or adding new room to the back or

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,850
for example excavating a new basement or

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,820
a swimming pool but it also includes

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:36,230
something more significant like building

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:40,510
a new two-story house or putting in

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:44,690
50-story residential apartment with

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,910
commercial space on the bottom so as you

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,150
can see some of these are gonna pose a

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:55,280
risk to the railway alignment that's

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:57,560
tunnel based so for example of 50-story

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,450
building right on top of your alignment

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,460
tunnel alignment it's going to be very

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,910
risky and you will want to know about it

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,820
whereas if someone is just putting in

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,830
new fencing or bringing some office feed

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,630
else then that's gonna be not much of a

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,460
risk

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,460
so once again the conventional

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,820
methodology is to get other junior staff

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,310
to do it or you pay their firms out

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,290
there that do this for you and it costs

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:30,130
about $70 per da so the council's we're

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:34,040
looking at about 7 to 8 councils and

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:37,130
each council has about a thousand das

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:44,210
per year so you can imagine that the

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:47,630
costs add up really quickly so what they

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,880
would do is look at so what you see here

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,550
is the black lines is the tunnel

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:57,140
alignment and the orange lines are a

00:12:52,550 --> 00:13:00,680
buffer zone around it so the intern

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,050
would look at all these look at all the

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,980
addresses that sit along that alignment

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:11,720
that buffered alignment and search it on

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:14,180
the council council website and find out

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,450
whether it's a high risk da or low risk

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,970
da and it recorded so if

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,430
what I've heard about ten years ago all

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,300
this information was still not online

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,450
and you had to call into a website and

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,460
then talk to someone and do all this so

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,690
I think we've gone a long way from there

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,420
already but we can still do better so

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:43,100
the limitations of this is that it's

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:48,890
slow it's costly and the biggest problem

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:52,040
is the infrequent update whenever DEA

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:56,810
comes in you want to know as early as

00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:01,300
possible otherwise you it could pose a

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:06,950
high risk to the design of your railway

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:08,690
so introducing the DEA bot so what we've

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,170
done with it is to try to have a

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:16,040
pipeline that automates all this work so

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,840
what we did was we merge the geocoded

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,780
national address file with lot shape

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,090
datasets the geo current national

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,800
address file is essentially a data set

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,970
containing all the addresses in

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,590
Australia with a location as scientific

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:33,770
this location information is in the form

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,560
of longitude and latitude and lots our

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:38,840
parcels of land on which properties sit

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,020
and there are these rectangular plots

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,750
that you can see we merge these two

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,320
datasets to match an address to a lot

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,450
which will we will then use we filter

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,810
out all these Lots along the buffered

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:58,550
alignment and we will have a list of

00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:03,020
addresses associated with a lot which we

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:09,560
will then search for on the council

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:12,350
websites so this is the city of

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,960
Parramatta council website or particular

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:20,990
da we found that a lot about 80% of

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:28,640
these council websites actually use the

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:30,680
same technology so it's it was really

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,400
easy to write scraper you want rewrite

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,610
one square

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:38,600
and it works for pretty much all of them

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:45,490
with a little bit of tweaking and after

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,490
we scrape all these DEA information we

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,820
came up with a pipeline to do all this

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:58,130
so first of all we use a bit of natural

00:15:52,820 --> 00:16:01,970
language processing to I guess clean the

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:05,570
text so we perform lower casing stemming

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:09,380
and removal of non-alphabetic characters

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:14,260
and removal removal of stop words so

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:17,650
this is a pre standard text cleaning and

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:24,170
then we form the document turn matrix as

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:31,279
a feature vector so that's the result

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:33,380
and we chose the most I think 2,200 most

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,910
important features so these include

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:40,420
words such as apartment a basement build

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:44,270
level story tower

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,040
so with that feature vector we feed it

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,870
what we fed we tested quite a few

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,370
different machine learning algorithms

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:58,010
and in the end week we chose XG boost

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:03,740
well everyone knows extry boosts ruse

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:06,640
cable so the results of our machine

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,220
learning classifier we got a recall of

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,170
95 percent and an accuracy of 85 percent

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,829
with an area on the curve ball from zero

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:18,400
point nine five we chose to optimize the

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:23,900
recall rate because we don't want to

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,949
miss any high-risk das that may be

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:34,040
coming through so we traded off in

00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:36,910
accuracy to yeah so this is the result

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,590
that engineers will be able to look at

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,510
the green ones here are classified as

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,360
low risk and the red ones here are

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,900
classified as high risk so an example we

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,750
say

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,880
removal of a tree in a conservation that

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,500
is not going to pose much risk to the

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:56,720
tunnel this other one here is demolition

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,340
of the rear portion of dwelling and it's

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,890
reconstruction with a new first floor

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,710
addition so two floor house you're going

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:10,600
to have a deeper foundation and that

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,530
could possibly pose a risk to the tunnel

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,280
depending on the tunnel depth that

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,310
you're building so the benefits of the

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,750
da's da baat is that we can get a

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:27,080
frequent update of the da register and

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:32,420
also we can concentrate the engineers

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,430
efforts into more meaningful tasks so we

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,710
also save a lot of time which means we

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,760
save a lot of taxpayers money and we can

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,480
use that money to build more

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,230
infrastructure we also get increased

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,540
coverage so we make sure that no DA

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,300
isn't missed in one of the previous

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,060
railway projects a basement exa complete

00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,340
excavation next to a station box was

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,350
missed and that meant that the station

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,320
had to be dug deeper than it was

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,870
designed resulting in changes to both

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,730
the station and track design and in that

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:11,050
ended up costing quite a bit of money

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:13,220
for the client so some of the

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,890
improvements that we've identified that

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,650
needed to may be made is to scrape more

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,290
relevant information such as so right

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,860
now we have description and location but

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,610
if we could also scrape the day the cost

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:32,030
of work that will help us improve the

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,070
performance of the classifier we are

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,290
also looking at using different

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,290
techniques such as pre train word

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:43,010
embeddings with new neural networks that

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:45,860
could possibly improve our the

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,470
performance of the classifier and also

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,100
we were looking to increase the utility

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:56,679
of this process so that if we download

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,330
all the attached documents such as trans

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,600
transport assessments traffic

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,519
assessments maybe geotechnical reports

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,340
then we could gather a lot of the

00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:10,299
information about that surrounding area

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,700
which could be useful in other projects

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,880
so some of the future work that we're

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,130
looking to doing is to store all this

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
information is the into a post gist

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,830
database so it's pretty much a

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:30,679
PostgreSQL database with geographical

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:33,110
information we're also looking so that

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:37,600
this will allow a more automatic

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:39,740
pipeline which can then allow a

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,769
subscription for daily and weekly

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,769
reports on newly submitted or recently

00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:50,120
updated high-risk days so you can

00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:52,429
subscribe to an alert so every day if a

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,039
high-risk da comes through you'll get an

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,039
email giving you all the details and you

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,500
can click a link to read it and see

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:04,190
whether it's gonna pose a risk to your

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:08,840
project or not and it will also allow

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:11,750
easy retrieval of archived documents as

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,720
we've mentioned before and there's the

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,720
end of my talk you can contact me here
