Title: "New Phone, Who Dis?: Human Authentication in the Digital Age" - Yaakov Smith (PyCon AU 2019)
Publication date: 2019-08-02

Description: 
	Yaakov Smith

When proving somebody’s identity, it’s usually an important matter and critical to get right. With digital licences springing up around the globe, including here in New South Wales, how can we be sure that the computer is telling the truth? Does digitising the process actually improve it?

00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,809
you know surprising twists I'm not going

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,030
to introduce myself too much other than

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,889
just to say that I don't work for so see

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,450
yourself way also the RMS or any other

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,699
part in New South Wales government and

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,260
I'm not representing them today I just

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,269
do dangerous things when I'm bored now I

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,980
might be a software developer but I also

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,199
have a love for Jewish tales and Hasidic

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,869
stories and one of my favorites is from

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,980
Europe about 300 years ago where as

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,960
different as it was back then

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,579
life was very different but people often

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,020
travel from town to town and rabbis

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,300
would often make these journeys from one

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,860
village to another to provide counsel to

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,280
answer any complex questions in Jewish

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,870
law on one such trip a certain rabbi was

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
traveling with a wagon driver he'd hired

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,680
after visiting a few of these towns the

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,140
wagon driver turned to the rabbi and

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,820
said rabbi I'm very jealous of you in

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,559
every town we stopping the people give

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,140
you honor and respect but they just

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,940
ignore me there are I thought for a

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,739
moment and said well since they don't

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,930
really know either of us why don't we

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,850
swap if I arrived in town in your

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,689
clothing driving the wagon and you

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,450
arrived in mine

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,130
they'll honor you instead the driver

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,630
very quickly agreed to this and when

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,700
they arrived in town the people crowded

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,520
around the wagon and showed honor to the

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,170
person who they thought was the rabbi so

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,670
far so good until one of the leaders of

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,070
town brought out a large volume of the

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,360
Talmud and said rabbi was so happy that

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,640
you're here we have a very difficult

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,280
question that nobody can solve we've

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,729
been arguing over it for weeks so the

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,439
rabbi looked into the Talmud he ran one

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,720
hand over the text the other through his

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,070
beard he closed his eyes and thought for

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,619
a moment before looking up at the

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,810
townspeople and he said this is your

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,070
difficult question this is what you've

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,110
been arguing over for weeks

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,689
you're wasting my time this is actually

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,229
an easy question it's so simple even

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,250
that my wagon driver cannot saw it why

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,280
don't you go and ask him

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,960
and so they did and of course the wagon

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,290
driver who was really the rabbi could

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,369
answer the complicated question easily

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,229
now I love this story for a few

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,540
different reasons the wagon driver was

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,149
sneaky and clever and managed to solve

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,500
the situation without blowing his cover

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,060
but it's also so simple that I could be

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,440
pulling the same stunt today I could

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,820
have just

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,540
but somebody else who knows the slides

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,910
and nobody would really be any the wiser

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,560
so how do you know who somebody is the

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,940
best way is always to ask them because

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,840
people usually know who they are better

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,610
than anyone else

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,290
but sometimes we need to know for sure

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,670
sometimes we need to you know cover

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,950
ourselves sometimes there's a legal

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,090
obligation and people can lie

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,990
particularly when it's in their best

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,550
interests so before we dive into digital

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,990
licenses let's first have a brief look

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,670
at identity and authentication in

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,170
general well then have a look at digital

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,220
driver's license and particularly what

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,490
they're trying to pull off here in New

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,490
South Wales

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,810
so driver's license really mix those all

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,550
three concepts that come into this we

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,380
have identity which is who you are

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,000
we have authentication which is

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,310
understanding who you are approving who

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,900
you are and then authorization which is

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,070
figuring out if you're allowed to do

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,380
something or not if you're permitted or

00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,420
prohibited in theory this is a fairly

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,190
simple flow it can tell you who I am and

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,530
then you figure out if that person is

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,660
allowed to do it or not but people can

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,360
lie and so we need a wait at the middle

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,760
stage to be very confident in who

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,230
somebody actually is and so

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,670
traditionally for personal identity we

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,830
use identity documents and these

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,150
normally have three main factors the

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,170
first one is that they describe the

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,120
person that they're talking about

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,610
because if the identity document doesn't

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,120
say that it's me that's of no use to

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,980
anybody or Refik leave no use to me the

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,870
other one is it has to describe ideally

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,100
just one person because if an identity

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,540
document can describe a thousand

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,060
different people any of them could

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,410
pretend to be another one in the set and

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,510
the last one is we need to prove that

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,280
there's a real identity document that is

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,350
authentic and that is genuine and

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,770
usually in nowadays we have some sort of

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,520
intricate design or a holographic device

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,320
traditionally they didn't have these and

00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,880
they were easy to fake and this is

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,650
basically a certificate authority for

00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,270
humans we go off to some other Authority

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,310
that's trusted by the person we're

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,050
trying to prove our identity to and we

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,150
get a document from them that says who

00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,709
we are so it's the same as whether I'm

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,450
trying to use my driver's license or

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,550
passport to open a bank account or

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,410
whether a web server says you know I'm

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,100
really google.com here's my certificate

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,870
to prove it so if we stop at just the

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,799
factors that identify a person we can

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,959
get to something like a photo card

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,280
this is a sample image from the old rms

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,530
website they actually don't seem to have

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,300
any anymore but there's a legal document

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,900
it's a driver's license and - the

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,900
driving and - the license it's under the

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,389
photocard Act of 2005 but if we start a

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,159
layer authentication authorization on

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,479
top of this then we get to something

00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,699
like a driver's license because this has

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,620
additional information specifically it

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,330
includes the license class which is what

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,699
you're allowed to drive be it a heavy

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,949
rigid truck a bus a motorcycle or so on

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,180
in any special conditions like you might

00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,889
not be allowed to drive high-performance

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,720
vehicles you might have to drive while

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,310
wearing glasses or you might not be

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,310
allowed to drive with any blood alcohol

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,900
in your system at all on the flip side

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,520
we have digital identity which I think

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,690
we're all fairly familiar familiar with

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,030
it's the same challenges in different

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,500
scenarios because your identity isn't

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,120
really who you are it's a piece of data

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,380
in a database somewhere although

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,810
nowadays it's probably a JSON document

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,849
or UML document and there's no third

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,620
party that you can turn to to say hey is

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:19,349
this person who they are if I show up

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,849
and say I'm user 53 then you as the

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:22,530
identity provider have to be able to

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,180
prove that yourself and so we use

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,969
pre-agreed secrets and only passwords

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,409
sometimes client certificates or any

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:31,349
other sorts of multi-factor

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,460
authentication on that we do still have

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,650
an element of having a third party

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,360
attest your identity but only by

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,639
delegating the entire authentication

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,050
process to them and we definitely seem

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,259
to love creating new identity providers

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,729
to do this all the time and the other

00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,139
thing you can do to prove your identity

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,300
to somebody who isn't the identity

00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,099
provider is to endorse that order to

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,529
perform some sort of public action that

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,719
says this is definitely me for example

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,400
this person says they're Bill Gates and

00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,169
the user name is this is Bill Gates but

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,370
I have no way of actually knowing if

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,430
it's Bill Gates or if it's just some

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,050
random person on the Internet and so the

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,819
proof they provided in this case it's a

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,000
picture of Bill Gates who I recognize

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,940
they're endorsing it by holding up a

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,990
card with the username for edit and

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,000
because this to this Twitter account

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,080
also says it's Bill Gates but that could

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
mean nothing the car could be

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,800
photoshopped but also has that little

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,770
verification chip that people really

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,599
seem to lust after so but if I trust

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,490
that Twitter has done their verification

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,440
check correctly then this person's

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,870
actually Bill Gates and because they're

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,909
presenting this card with the reddit

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,569
users username I can be fairly sure that

00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,099
either they

00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,809
both bill gates or at least they're both

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,779
run by the same social media manager or

00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:41,039
something on those lights and so we've

00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,749
got personal identity and digital

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,449
identity which differ on some

00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:47,369
fundamental core concepts but overall

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,110
they're fairly similar your personal

00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:50,309
identity you are born with usually it's

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,959
registered with government to get your

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,969
first ever identity document which is a

00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,429
birth certificate if you don't do that

00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:57,629
you can have a lot of trouble later on

00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:59,729
you only really get one unless you're

00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,080
like a spy and you create a fake one or

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,149
you're in witness protection and the

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,499
government does that for you and you

00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,029
prove it by getting a third party and

00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,800
say yes I know this person they are who

00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,869
they say they are and then digital

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,069
identity that's just a piece of data so

00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:13,050
you can have a zero if you're completely

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,129
offline or you can click every single

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,449
create account button you ever come

00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,800
across in your life and have a million

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,749
of them

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,309
you just get one usually by asking

00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:22,800
sometimes they'll try and verify it with

00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:24,300
an email or a text message and to prove

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,159
to the identity provider you have a

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,719
degreed secret the proof to somebody

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,099
else you need to post something or

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,339
perform some sort of action that says

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:35,069
this is who I am so let's have a look at

00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,249
digital driver's licenses what really is

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:41,099
it so in short it's really your existing

00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:43,740
driver's license but on a phone there's

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:44,610
nothing really complex or fancy it's

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,139
usually an app and it's usually

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,740
different apps depending on where you

00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:52,979
are because there's no standard every

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,809
region every government organization or

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,459
card manufacturer trying to build these

00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:59,129
are generally doing their own from the

00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:01,529
ground up that's a that's basically not

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:02,759
invented here at a global scale there's

00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:04,079
no integration something like Apple

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,449
wallet or Google Wallet yet because

00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,740
there's no standard for it and it sort

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,419
of sits in the middle of that table

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,039
because it reflects your personal

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,379
identity and if there's aspects of it

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,610
there but it's a digital piece of data

00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,110
and certainly it's digital access

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,789
controls because I don't really want

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,709
anybody else being able to log in and

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,110
download my license and then have you

00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,969
know my name and address and maybe be

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,819
able to try and tweak the photo and say

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:28,249
they're there me we also need those

00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,259
access controls that's a legal document

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:35,430
and so there's legal repercussions if

00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,990
you try and do bad things with them it's

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,339
a recent vengeance cropped up in the

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,300
last few years and I think it's because

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,529
somebody in the government sort of

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,659
looked at one of these memes and thought

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,639
well I work with licenses why can't we

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,230
put that in there that's either that or

00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,310
they're just carrying it around as the

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,610
last thing in their wallet

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,749
we'll really been bugging them it's not

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,790
also just some funny thing New South

00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:55,350
Wales is trying to do if you hit a day

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,149
from South Australia your state already

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,709
has one boat not being from South

00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,709
Australia I have no idea how it works

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,420
and Queensland also eyeing a - there's

00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,649
some brief mention of it on their

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,259
website that they're sort of thinking

00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,490
about rolling something out there and

00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,319
the United States has a bit of a head

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,120
start several states have already been

00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,309
trialing them I found articles that

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,470
talked about Iowa Delaware and Oklahoma

00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,970
in Louisiana which is the green on the

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,610
bottom if I have my geography correct

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,779
launch there's over a year ago there

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,920
could be more in other continents as

00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,519
well but this is all I've managed to

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,870
find so far so why would I want a

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,449
digital driver's license what's the

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,769
point there's a bunch of common talking

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:33,360
points used by the governments around

00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,149
the world and also the card

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,829
manufacturers the most obvious ones is

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,420
convenience that's one less card to

00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,980
carry around adding it as an app on my

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,839
phone carries no weight takes up no

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,079
space having it as a card in my pocket

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,389
does in theory if there's a privacy

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,949
boost from this as well because it's on

00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,480
my phone I can choose to display

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,670
different parts of the license to

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,689
different people so if the police pull

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,430
me over they probably want to see

00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:58,110
everything if I just want to get into a

00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,550
pub they don't need all of that

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,829
they just need my photos so they know

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,329
it's me and then whether I'm over 18 or

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,750
under 18 they don't even need to know my

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:08,279
date of birth another one that's talked

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,050
about is if you lose your licence card

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,120
somebody can find it and grab your

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,589
details and with a digital license you

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,689
could wipe it remotely if you lose it

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,980
although in practice you'd probably wipe

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,809
your whole phone rather than just the

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,259
license and it's probably guarded by

00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,670
your PIN code anyway with a magical

00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,069
power of the internet it can be always

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,480
up-to-date you don't need to go to RMS

00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,220
and then wait for them to print a new

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,629
card and post it to you and you also

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,889
don't need a change of address label

00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,439
because you can just update the address

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,939
field in place and in theory

00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,439
cryptographic proofs can make it more

00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,660
trustworthy than a physical card

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,149
something like RSA is a very very hard

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,740
to break whereas people can actually if

00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,449
you can print the holographic device at

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,459
the RMS in theory somebody else can

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,929
print it as well if you just google you

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,579
know fake New South Wales digital like

00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,019
fake New South Wales driver's license

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,240
now you can find a whole bunch of

00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,509
different places trying to sell them to

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,790
young teenagers who try to get into pubs

00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:02,100
so so far it sounds fairly attractive

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,180
but I have two major concerns with that

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,800
the first one is we're introducing

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,720
technology to a system that's fairly

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,970
proven fairly robust and it works and

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,370
that's always a sign of problems to come

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,080
and the other one is that it's not

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,280
standardized and it's not federated so

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,040
everyone's building their zone from the

00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,540
ground up in silos that first point has

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,830
me quite concerned because the

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,960
Australian government generally doesn't

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,310
go well with technology this is one of

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,650
my favourite tumblers it's from the

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,810
first started on the 1st of January 2014

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,980
or at least somebody back dated till

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:38,940
then and it has nothing

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,620
so that has me quite worried and then

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,930
you get into what if scenarios for

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,670
example what if I lose power what if I

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,340
had power and I've been driving and

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,780
streaming Spotify the car and that's a

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,970
long road trip the police pull me over

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,770
and I've run out of battery what happens

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,410
if my screens cracked and either you

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,580
can't read the details or it's unsafe

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,990
for me to actually interact with the

00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,240
touch screen to bring up anything on the

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,920
device what happens if I don't have

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
cellular data what if I want prepaid and

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,100
I've run out what if I'm roaming

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,730
internationally what if my carrier falls

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,680
over and what if the other person has

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,180
any of these problems as well like there

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,250
is a reason that the New South Wales

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,500
Police Force on some of their vehicles

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,300
have an HF antenna and if you're looking

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,070
at that going there are many antennas

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,700
which is he talking about I'm talking

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,600
about the big one mounted to the tow bar

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,700
that one according to the police

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,250
propaganda unit / Facebook page is

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,840
mounted on rural cars in border areas

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,490
according to the comments on the

00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,680
Facebook page it's anywhere on the

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,000
Central Coast as well but they're

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,980
expecting to be in the middle of nowhere

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,810
where any other thing there that needs

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,910
one of the other antennas won't

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,250
necessarily work so what's the chance

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,740
I'll have data there what's the chance

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,000
that we'll have data there and then we

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,370
can think a bit bigger and getting too

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,230
bit more complicated scenarios for

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,210
example what about interstate

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,680
international license if somebody from

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,670
South Australia try to prove their

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,980
identity to me with their digital

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,990
license today I would actually have no

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,510
idea how to prove it and somebody

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,530
internationally as well I wouldn't know

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,900
how to prove theirs they probably would

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,070
know how to prove mine if you're

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,750
familiar with the International driver's

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,460
permit system you can basically go to

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,760
NRMA and they'll print off a book that's

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,529
internationally record

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,180
with translations of your license fields

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,560
and about eight languages but it

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,260
required to keep your original license

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,760
on you it's a police force in another

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,380
country going to look at them go yeah I

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,050
just need to see a real license oh it's

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,140
your phone yeah right like how about how

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,040
they're going to know that that's real

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,320
what if we need to keep a copy for

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,730
record-keeping ordered purposes or what

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,710
if I get into a crash you need to

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,120
exchange details like at the moment

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,010
generally you'd take a photo of a

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,470
license oh do I take a photo of this

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,610
screen that seems odd and if you try and

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,980
hire a car that often photocopy your

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,660
license do again but put my phone on the

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,660
flatbed scanner and just photocopy it it

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,460
seems strange and then you can get into

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,130
even more complex scenarios like for

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,260
example when disc was in the new cycle

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,210
last a lot of people on Twitter had this

00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,980
crazy idea it's not too far off that

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,779
maybe a license app could monitor you

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,160
monitor your location in the background

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,010
and automatically report you for

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,529
speeding infringement or in the United

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,880
States one one document talked about

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,140
using Bluetooth beacons so the police

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,339
don't even have to get out their car to

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,200
know who's driving the car they pulled

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,150
over and we've got things like

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,620
mac-address randomization for a reason I

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,620
really don't want my phone broadcasting

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,680
Who I am to everybody within wireless

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,230
range especially not voluntarily like a

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,750
bug the issue a fixer don't do that in

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,250
the first place

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,560
what about identity theft and forgeries

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,480
because if we don't get the cryptography

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,880
perfect on this it's a lot easier to

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
send commands to a GPU buffer then it is

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,779
to render a holographic device on a

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,430
physical card so it could be easier to

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:46,060
fake a digital license than a real one

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,470
so let's see what they did in New South

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,040
Wales and see if addresses any of this

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,290
at all the first thing they did is there

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,730
is a bill a legal document to set the

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,980
foundations for this because the license

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,930
isn't just a thing RMS created it's

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,670
enshrined in law as they need to change

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,980
that law to recognize a digital license

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,029
as well although it's a bit odd that

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,920
everyone the law they called a digital

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,020
driver's license and if we ever get rid

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,190
of the original one we've now got still

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,750
we've still got this distinction between

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,209
digital driver's license driver's

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,140
license I would expect it to be the same

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,209
if you've never read an amendment before

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,810
it's basically a difference for the law

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:21,280
that says am it Biff insert they're like

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,450
Parliament is basically just people

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,770
arguing over a pool request all day

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,410
but there's a few highlights in this

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,880
amendment that really bring the digital

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,560
driver's license system actually into

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
New South Wales the first one is that

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,740
any digital license approved by the

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,350
authority the authority being the Roads

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,200
and Maritime Services I believe is now a

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,030
license so so far they haven't said

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,070
anything as a license and so there isn't

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,420
one but when they do they just have to

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,110
say this is a digital driver's license

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,060
here you go

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,220
so the law if the implementation details

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,020
are completely out of the law but also

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,760
it excludes trial licenses which i think

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,290
is a fairly sneaky legal way to keep

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,670
your beta out of production because

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,270
they've got these trial licenses I have

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:05,230
one but it isn't legally a driver's

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,390
license my favorite paragraph somebody

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,120
checking your phone you don't have to

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,260
give your phone over to them so today if

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,760
the police pull you over there probably

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,050
take your license card back into their

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,810
car look it up on the computer and run

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,790
some checks with a phone with a digital

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,950
ice digital license on a phone rather

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,260
the phone stays with me I don't have to

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,420
give it over to anybody similarly if

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,350
someone were to seize your license I

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,630
think that's under the gambling and

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,230
liquor legislation for some reason they

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,460
can't seize your phone either and

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,320
there's an exclusion built into the road

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,670
rules because currently if you try and

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,860
get your phone while you're driving and

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,020
driving is a very loose term in that

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,089
rule you can be up for fines and demerit

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,060
points so how do you show your digital

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,620
license so what this paragraph says is

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,510
that once the police ask your digital

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,620
license you can grab your phone unlock

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,240
it load it up and show it to them

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,130
without breaking the road rule of don't

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,300
use your phone while driving on the

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,310
other hand if you grab the license

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,570
before they ask even if they're fully

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,130
over and you're just trying to preempt

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,160
it you could still be in trouble you

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,569
could be up for fines and demerit points

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,510
sort of sucks the armies have a nice

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,220
disagreement on that one - and the last

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,410
one is that service New South Wales now

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,579
get access to licence data so clearly

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,810
they're in charge of the digital sign

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,370
that's probably a good thing because I

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,770
find that the technology usually works

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,630
even though Australian government IT

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,760
projects has no post in five and a half

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,810
years so she South Wales has actually

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,100
done a good job that the federal

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,350
government is now trying to emulate with

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,699
services Australia I've applied to my

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,920
working with children's check online no

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,750
issues I do coverage Oh online and no

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,860
issues and the only time they've really

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,510
been in the news was when the state

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,910
government issued compulsory third party

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,420
insurance refund and said login to get

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,120
your free

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,590
money unsurprisingly the service

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,430
couldn't really cope with that little

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,740
crashed but the first article I came

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,960
across talking about the implementation

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,730
mentioned the blockchain which makes no

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,890
sense for this at all or really any

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,330
application so I should just run

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,430
screaming particularly given at the

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,750
immutable public ledger nature of the

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,450
blockchain it means anybody with access

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,490
to the licensed data would have access

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,420
to everybody's license data for all time

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,560
so the good news is that they haven't

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,390
actually used this I've been told that

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,860
they're not using it and that puts them

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,360
off to a really good start ahead of any

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,970
other project that actually does try use

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,920
watching so if we look at the app the

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,480
first thing your assets log in username

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,070
password they have their own account

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,750
system running for many years and

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,030
they'll also ask you to set up a four

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,530
digit PIN code so that you can you know

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,090
walk out access but without having to

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,190
log in with your full password every

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:35,980
single time didn't do that yet but now I

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,990
did and you can log the thread at

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,460
pointer Teddy face ID reor Androids

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,760
equivalent which has no name and

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,080
truncated title text for some reason and

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,430
then once you do that you'll if you've

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,050
got an account already you'll be asked

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,030
to link it to the RMS by entering your

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,200
license details and accept some terms

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,810
wish at the moment you can only do if

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,650
you in a trial suburb if you are if

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,930
you've already done that

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,150
it'll loading your license and you can

00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,620
see your driver's license as I just an

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,300
unnamed driver's license therefore

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,040
initially and you might have additional

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,900
cards as well like a fishing license or

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,640
a boating license or for some reason are

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,340
working with children's check ID number

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,720
even though it's not a license and this

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,400
is basically what the license looks like

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,350
it's very similar to the existing

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,680
physical card and that has all our main

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,180
fields we've got name address license

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,770
class date of birth and so on

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,120
there's a few things the physical

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,620
license doesn't have that they've added

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,090
the first being the New South Wales

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,840
government logo in the top left is

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,670
animated

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
they call that a security feature I

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,770
don't think an animated gif is a

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,250
security feature

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,480
and the giant wattle behind the qr-code

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,309
which I'll get to in a second the

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,809
license number is actually trying to

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,820
emulate the holographic device on card

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,679
so as you tilt your phone the pattern

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,570
changes again they call the security

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,340
feature we can a flick seller ommited

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,040
OpenGL I don't know how much security

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,440
that really provides but then we've got

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,460
the QR code which at the moment just

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,350
looks like white noise because it's a

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,790
big one

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,470
and the app includes a feature to verify

00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,910
the QR code and make sure it's a real

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,520
license if you scan it you get one of

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,220
three out cars yes this is valid no it

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,230
is not or maybe it was valid but it's

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,460
expired so please refresh and try again

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,070
and you'll get this after about ten

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,390
minutes so if you're offline for a bit

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,429
this is what you'll see when you're

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,960
trying to scan it if we drat scan with

00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,960
anything else we'll just get back a text

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,429
which looks like a bit of a mess but to

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,920
me it looks like basically for at least

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:24,380
mostly we've got this leading one dot

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,470
followed by three fields encoded with

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,000
basic C for also separated by dots so

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,860
that sounds a lot like the spec for JSON

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,900
web tokens basically four times three

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,460
separated by dots so we should just be

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,860
able to paste that into a JSON web token

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,690
decoder and no it's not actually a JSON

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,820
web token our header fields are wrong

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,040
with a payload in pars the signature

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,620
size seems wrong so it just can't be

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,950
adjacent web token so let's try passing

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,900
each section by hand and see you again

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,070
at first after that first one dot which

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,870
I'm going to assume is maybe a version

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,610
number of some sort we've got basically

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,410
four encoded jason with four fields

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,720
we've got p which is a number and it's

00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,000
big enough to be a UNIX timestamp we've

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,530
got C and T which are both one so I need

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,300
much larger sample set to see where

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,830
these differ but I'm willing to bet one

00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,090
of them is a license type so it might be

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,760
two or three for say fishing or boating

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,390
licenses then we've got U which is a

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,700
UUID

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,230
or a GU ID depending on if you could

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,630
follow Microsoft or everyone else when

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,630
it comes to naming them and some sort of

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,890
good and the you maybe it's a user ID

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,710
because I don't see anything else in

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,760
there that would identify this the user

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,320
our second section has no known

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,090
structure that I can tell and changes on

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,340
every refresh so it's probably some sort

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:35,320
of encrypted blob or hash although being

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:39,380
256 bytes it's a bit too big for a hash

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,900
and our third section is more your time

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,440
is running faster than mine

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,540
and then the third section is more text

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,190
we've got a leading one dot followed by

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,520
the license number that was on the card

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:54,790
followed by a unix time step so if we

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,460
look at the identity document let's look

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,410
at our tests again it describes the

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,880
person and only the person because we

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,520
copied all that info from a physical

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,130
card but is it actually an authentic

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,250
document can we prove its real with that

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,840
QR code so if you notice there are two

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,370
UNIX timestamps and this is sort of my

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,309
fault because the first one really

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,470
didn't exist there was only that second

00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,840
one in the third field of the of the QR

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,640
code but on the day that I got this

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,650
within 18 minutes I discovered that if

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,880
you unpack it or change the expiry and

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,000
repack at all you now have one that

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,010
never expires well-done service New

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,900
South Wales well done actually for

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,520
fixing it in two weeks new app update

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,530
new server update or got fixed fairly

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,179
quickly I don't want to add a second

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,540
expiry rather than replacing it that's

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:42,400
just the way they did it but that got me

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,140
thinking that I don't need a fake the QR

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,570
code if it just comes up with a green

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,090
tick all I need is a license that looks

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,650
real and comes up with a green tip so I

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,050
could Photoshop print my own or I could

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,420
take an idea from Pokemon specifically

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,100
every pokemon has six course stats in

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,380
Pokemon go being a simplified game they

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,240
have three but every Pokemon also born

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,790
with bonus stats that run from zero to

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,040
15 and these are sort of randomly

00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,630
determined at birth you never see them

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,070
in game until two weeks ago and they

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,210
literally added a bar graph for them

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,160
there's supposed to be secret

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,809
so people reverse engineered these with

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,809
apps that would scrape the screen buffer

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,550
do OCR on the images and figure out what

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,900
their health is what the combat power is

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,300
and figure out what those bonus stats

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,679
were in theory I could do the same to a

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,140
license I could scrape the screens to

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,090
see the QR code in either overlay my own

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,429
data around the QR codes that still

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,210
comes up green or lift the QR code and

00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:35,650
apply to my own view on top of that

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,700
that's too much hard work so instead I

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,200
did the next best thing

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,630
and I actually took the certainty South

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,360
Wales app D compiled it change the

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,450
render instructions recompile it resize

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,679
it and upload it to my phone

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,340
I'm not going to provide detailed

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,200
instructions on how to do that because

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,080
because I think that would be grossly

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,640
irresponsible vocal arias but they're

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,860
absolutely react natives so there's some

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,470
Java code I had to tweak the smiley

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,930
level the il level and then the rest is

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,110
mostly JavaScript I know JavaScript has

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,820
been around for a while so this actually

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,680
works because that screenshot on the

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,490
left-hand side and from previous slides

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,770
is a screenshot I didn't photoshop in

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,320
Ash Ketchum details the app rendered

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,360
that on its own and so this shows off a

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,980
fundamental flaw the humans will read

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,140
everything except the QR code because

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,510
humans can't read QR codes yet as a

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,640
computer only reads the QR code it

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,620
doesn't read any of those fields and the

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,210
only common information unless there's

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,250
something in that encrypted blob is the

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,540
license number so names pictures

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,630
whatever you could tweak and there's no

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,640
way for the QR code to prove it's real

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,290
and in theory if my phone showed the

00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,700
license details when I scanned it I

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,350
could probably trust it then it'd be

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,120
down to any implementation bugs in the

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,830
security of the QR code but

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,450
fundamentally here I have to trust

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,970
something on the phone of somebody I

00:24:51,450 --> 00:25:02,340
don't know yet or don't trust yet and so

00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:04,470
that's just fundamentally broken so for

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,750
most of us then we can't actually trust

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,300
it if you're the police or if you're

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,710
some RMS officers quite possibly you can

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,270
look that up from primary information

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,560
which is what they do now and they take

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,030
your license they take it back into the

00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,100
police car and look it up on the

00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,840
computer and so for digital licenses

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,130
they really should do the same thing but

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,960
for the rest of us we don't have that

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,090
access yet and so somebody like me

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,800
pulling this off nobody else can really

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:30,930
prove that you did or didn't do it so so

00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,490
in conclusion I think the driver's

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,740
license system needs a standard so that

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,160
other other regions don't make this

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,870
mistake

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,570
ideally often search New South Wales

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,890
fixes it I really hope they fix it and

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,880
that we don't make any of the mistakes

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,400
that other regions may have already

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,470
solved as well ideally we also need

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,360
interoperability so that I can scan

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,760
someone else's license overseas - and

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,650
things like that in yourself Wales at

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,450
the moment you can't really trust them

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,210
until they do something to fundamentally

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,950
fix it and I'd encourage everybody that

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,740
when digital licenses comes to your

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,870
region you beat New South Wales or beat

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,309
anywhere else evaluate for yourself and

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,140
whether or not you think you can trust

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,850
it the government will definitely want

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,760
you to trust it but whether or not you

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,470
actually can should be up to you the

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,620
last thing I'll say is that my own

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,059
actual license isn't in this and the QR

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,770
code I put in there some in Photoshop

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,510
over so that my own license details

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,440
aren't in there but if you actually want

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,809
to see if yourself you just want to see

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,960
a demo just come up and ask I'm not too

00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,960
shy not too shy thank you

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,879
and trust your mic please enjoy a mug I

00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:42,259
know I've been with a girly boy

00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:43,669
thank you we don't have time for any

00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,139
questions and I'm sure you can also

00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:49,129
understand why we couldn't answer them

00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:51,820
on camera anyway but you are welcome to

00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,820
