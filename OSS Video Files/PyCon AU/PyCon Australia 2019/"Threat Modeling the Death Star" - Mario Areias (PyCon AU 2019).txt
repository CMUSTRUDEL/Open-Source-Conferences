Publication date: 2019-08-03
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Mario Areias

Threat modeling is one of the most important security activities. Yet they are usually done by security experts and can be quite dry and boring.This talk will cover a different way to do Threat Models by using Attack Trees. Attack trees are an easy, fun, engaging and inclusive for everyone.

welcome back everyone mal welcome back

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,880
everyone

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,130
mario is going to give us a rundown on

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,710
threat modeling the Death Star and

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,900
threat modeling is a really useful skill

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,650
so you also know where to expend all

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,359
your efforts

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:29,400
so please welcome Mario hello everyone

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,329
welcome to my talk thread modeling the

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,399
dev stop just a first introduction Mario

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,460
I have been a developer for ten years

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,770
recently I moved to security and

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,489
nowadays I'm security engineer at Landy

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,829
so my developer background helps me like

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,469
see security from the eyes of a

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,410
developer right and I want to talk about

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,989
tread modeling because subject is a bit

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,570
dry so be hard but I think is very

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,660
important to any developers to know

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,530
about it first things first

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,299
all right Star Wars is not my thing like

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,610
it belongs to Disney I don't want to be

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,030
like chased by Disney so please it's not

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,200
mine not in mind right cool just a quick

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:21,570
introduction about what's at read Molly

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,280
and first InfoSec as a community they

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,009
agree that tread Molly should be done

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,439
how and what exactly is Freddy modeling

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,060
it's kind of like not very well defined

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,130
yet so that's one of the many

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,680
definitions I found I like the

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,810
definition the most these definitions

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,960
talk about the process that helps to

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,450
identify enumerate prioritize threats

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,909
for a poetical attackers point of view

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,659
and I really like the attacker point of

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,909
view in this case that process can be

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,100
many different process so there are one

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,680
that called stride that's a very

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,159
checklist you'll go over five each one

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,020
of your threads security cards pasta the

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,030
one I feel like works better for

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,790
development for developers the one I

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,069
feel like when I try with developers the

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,110
work best is at actress so I'm going to

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,349
use Star Wars to talk about attack trees

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,379
right cool Star Wars

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,689
let's talk about Star Wars internally

00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:22,290
that story starts with view you in the

00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:25,200
audience you just became the CSO of the

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,409
Galactic Empire chief security officer

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,540
well done after so many years of hard

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,750
working start as a stormtrooper now yeah

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,989
all the way to the top as a chief

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:43,079
security officer that's a good news the

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:47,069
bad news this guy is your boss and he

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:51,180
kinda doesn't like the culture of

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:54,590
blameless culture you know it's not his

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,970
thing so you better know failure right

00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:01,250
that's what happens you predecessor by

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,659
doing but what's your favor is come on

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,750
you're working for the Galactic Empire

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,120
the biggest most powerful organization

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,919
in the galaxy they bring stability to

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,730
the galaxy and sometimes you need to

00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,459
fight those terrorists to the rebellion

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:21,419
but come on is the Galactic Empire you

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,819
are well protected on the other hand the

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,540
Galactic pirate has terrible security

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:29,909
and that's a footage over the rebellion

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,030
droid actually hacking into the entire

00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:36,810
network so you have kind of like some

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,319
work to do and your biggest problem

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:45,810
right now is the Deaf stop any big

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:49,650
waterfall project this project has been

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:53,370
20 years in the making has spent two

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,560
trillion credits so it's overdue over

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,379
budget the business is not happy with

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,709
how these delays and you need to secure

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,650
it right to make things harder your

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,090
previous ESO didn't do anything about

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,120
the secure of Death Star so it's how are

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,009
you good luck so I'm going to start

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,590
talking about attack trees an attack

00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,419
trees I see is first four four steps

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,239
right and then we're gonna cook through

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,489
all of them one is evil personas and

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,750
think about like attacker we need to

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,000
define what's an attacker

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,889
we're going to go through that get the

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
right people in the room and that's very

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,409
very important

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,389
if we're going to do a trend modeling

00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:32,129
you cannot do only if your security team

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,560
your security team has only one angle of

00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,419
the things your beauty or the death star

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,219
in this case you need to have your

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,479
developers as well or if you have

00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,919
operations team you'd have the

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,229
operations team in the room as well is

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,259
the whole minds combined it they'll come

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,939
up with a nice and good attack tree then

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,550
we're going to build the trees and then

00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,990
I'm gonna go very detail about that when

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,180
you build the attack trees we're gonna

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,319
come up with as a few risks right and

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,229
then we need to think about how we're

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:03,150
gonna mitigate those cool let's talk

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:07,110
about evil personas the first one script

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,919
KD right judge our beings know much

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,330
expertise doesn't have much resources

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,210
they don't organize themselves very well

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,129
to be honest tear Anandi like a threat

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,610
to the empire but it's good to map then

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:22,680
they are there the next one is a bounty

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,469
hunter han Solo

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,229
right II they usually have some

00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:31,020
expertise in some areas like they might

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,389
be very good to traffic something or

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,969
they are very good and Hugh something so

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,860
they have some level expertise these

00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,800
have some resources may be old

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,870
Millennium Falcon store somewhere but

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,240
they don't have much more than that

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,639
usually it didn't organize themselves

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,550
pretty well they have like the usually

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,740
work alone or by pairs so they don't

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,469
work together very closely so there

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,770
might be a threat but usually the more

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:02,370
an annoyance kind of a threat and

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,930
they'll have this one and the expertise

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,569
of these guys come on they do magic

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,139
right how do you defend against magic

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:12,779
like so possible hopefully and they like

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,509
and that's a hope you hurt some ranges

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:17,639
while ancients that your boss now Darth

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,379
Vader Q Hall then they don't exist

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,680
anymore so you just hope they're not

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,300
there right if they are there they are

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,680
hidden from the galactic power they

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,719
don't have much resources that are

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,490
probably hitting a planet far far away

00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:33,270
so they don't organize themselves very

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,610
well didn't have any cyber threat right

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,550
and then I'm just representing this is a

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,930
one persona but you can have from his

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,370
mouth

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,440
low rank stormtrooper to like a high

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,759
officer in the rank so they all can be

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,949
like inside the track so I'm just

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,930
putting on persona to make things like

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,639
quicker they have some level of

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,380
expertise after all they have been

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,229
trained by the Galactic part the best

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,970
organization the galaxy they might have

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,039
like very good resources especially if

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,289
your arrow on the high Hanks of the

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,850
Empire and they know how to organize

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,330
themselves pretty well if they want to

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,610
they have like military training so they

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,410
make this the subject be dangerous

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,910
and finally have nation-state attackers

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:22,770
that's princess Leah right she is like

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,350
the leader of the rebellion terrorist

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,750
organization that's funded by some

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,030
planets right and that's why is an issue

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,610
stage attacker so they can like afford

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,380
to have lots of expertise they have lots

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,009
of resources and to organize themselves

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,690
very well for a terrorist organization

00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,720
cool so there are the five attackers you

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:45,180
have in a moment so you define that your

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,590
first job is CSO so you know who are the

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,289
people who can attack you there's really

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,030
good now you need to get the right

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,370
people in the room to discuss the Death

00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,919
Star right and then we start with this

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,770
lovely gentleman that's the engineer

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,979
team of the desktop that's a picture of

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,740
the rogue one by the way so you you got

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,050
how of then in the room so you can we

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,539
are security you even managed to get

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,060
that to vendor in the room like to give

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,780
them a bit of motivation to help you and

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,760
I build the attack tree was a really

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,440
hard meeting to schedule though because

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,190
now you have people for however the

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:28,500
garlic's and the tarts Vader's agenda is

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:31,740
busy so there is that cool so we're

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,810
going to talk about attack trees what

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,320
attack trees are usually we start with a

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,510
goal that as a Tucker goal that's the

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,430
root note then you start to branch out

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,500
in different ways how we can accomplish

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,310
the goal so each branch is usually a

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,550
different option

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:52,020
cool we're going to go more in details

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:53,650
about that now so we first discuss based

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,830
on the personas you have

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,510
what kind of goals they can achieve if

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,760
you dare talk in the Deaf star and they

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,100
are very bad for the Empire you can talk

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,460
about like steel resources to tell

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,050
agents go over many many goals but the

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,390
two goals they're more dangerous for the

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,110
Empire is somebody takes control of the

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,860
Death Star

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,870
that's horrible or they manage to get

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,890
that star out of the action after 20

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,589
years in the making

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,800
it's all done and then like they need to

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:27,100
start back again but if we go back to

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,020
our like personas take care of take

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,390
control of Death Star is highly unlikely

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,339
and that's because you need the two

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,279
million people crew on the Death Star

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,500
that's a lot of people is high advanced

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,100
technology and is very expensive to

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,980
maintain

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,240
so you're most likely persona to take

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,910
control of the Death Star

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,140
it's priestess Leah even though the

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,210
rebellion probably doesn't have the

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,880
resources to do that even for them it's

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,520
quite expensive so we're gonna focusing

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,920
take that start out of action right

00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,790
we'll get rid of the desktop out of the

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,959
board so and then again you come up lots

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,730
of different options how you can

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,040
accomplish that and these two are the

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,680
most likely options that you found out

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,510
about you can't disable the desktop and

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,670
what we talked about disable I'm not a

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,350
cup I'm not talking about disabled in a

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,209
sense like if you turn it off the

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,370
desktop for five minutes you are

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,800
disabled in a way that renamer the

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,450
Deathstar back again is so expensive

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,640
that you might as well just buy a new

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,020
one

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,600
like you when you crack your iPhone

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,920
screen right to repair your iPhone

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,380
screen you might as well I get a new

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,060
iPhone so that's kind of disabled when

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,240
we are talking about here or you can

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,470
just plain destroy desktop right so

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,970
let's focus a little bit in how to

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,800
disable the desktop then again many

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,740
options were discussed and two options

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,660
come up one is located critical

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,940
assistance on the Deaf star and

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,420
compromise those systems may be the

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,360
history

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,730
hit hit system navigation system the

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,800
communication system whatever system you

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,510
compromised such a way and you disabled

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,290
in such a way that's so really hard

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:07,090
together that start back up or you can

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,760
cause a many a mechanical failure

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,020
in some away like some critical system

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,500
that you don't destroy the Death Star

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,590
but it's enough to stop everything and

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,960
just do the whole thing that probably

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,490
means like is multiple mechanical

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,000
failures and multi-core compromise of

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:28,020
systems but it is to our likelihood of

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,180
to happen all right

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,190
to have the system failure you need to

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,410
compromise this critical IT systems

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,210
right you cannot do that by just being a

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,550
power user the system protects against

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,800
that you need to get a root inside those

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,450
systems and try to compromise the in

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,730
such a way maybe you'll just run

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,610
somewhere encrypted everything throw the

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,640
keys away you remove the backups you do

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,210
whatever you want and for the mechanical

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,610
failure

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,470
you need to over lie overload some some

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,480
sort of critical infrastructure and then

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,070
again heating system might be one make

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,010
everyone like be very warm and the Deaf

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,630
star you can talk about the reactor can

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,890
talk about many different systems on the

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:11,020
desktop however and then that's where we

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,330
need to be very clear about the Deaf

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,270
star is not a usual software system you

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,700
have it's a weapon and that's a weapon

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,610
they don't expose much to the public

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,240
right this pose very little so how these

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,600
systems are behind impressive firewall

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,180
let's say that you need to get people

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,100
access to the internal network that's

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,560
the only way and remember we are talking

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,130
about like light-years of distance so

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,690
now your ping for my machine one planet

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,270
you take maybe two days to get on that

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,090
star right so we need to get access to

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,700
the internal network it the only way to

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,250
get ahead is to get physical access to

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,260
the Death Star and then we could go like

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,940
further further further then try to

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,850
think about how would you want to get

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,760
access to the desktop internal access

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:04,180
physical access but remember we have two

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:08,260
million people crew that's not very hard

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:11,200
and one of our personas is an internal

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,270
threat right so we're not going to go

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,970
further on that branch and then let's

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,130
move to another branch of the tree

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,650
that's all we have so far right we have

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,720
take that Deb style of the action

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,570
you want to disable the dev star you

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,470
come up with two different ways and

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,630
sometimes that happens we're doing

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,900
attack trees they come up in us in the

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,060
same the funnel in the same branch and

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,820
that's very interesting because means

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,030
that attacks give us the if the attacker

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,160
comes to that route given many options

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,030
to accomplish their goal so you need to

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,400
think really really hard about that

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,550
threat but for now let's move to the

00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,100
next the next way to try to take that

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,700
style of the action which is destroy the

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,560
Death Star right just destroy that star

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,440
is really really hard the first one is a

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,110
military attack right like the rebellion

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,300
have a big fleet of ships they can come

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,310
up and shoot to the Death Star to is

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,410
completely destroyed that's likely to

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,580
happen they most likely do that if you

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:19,690
want to cover that that star is there or

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:23,860
you can try the reactor and to destroy

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:27,700
the reactor is hard because you need to

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,740
shoot a thermal port and that's an error

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,080
that happened the design level of the

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,170
Death Star so for the Death Star has the

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,180
reactor on the very core and there's a

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,580
thermal port to get the heating out of

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,900
the reactor that goes all the way to the

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:46,810
outside of that star if some pilots can

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,780
manage to shoot the torpedo in there you

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,520
destroy the Death Star but this shots

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,200
like it's really hard because the table

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,510
part is just 2 meters wide

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,380
and you need to know where it is right

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:04,410
like so they need to actually also orbit

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:07,810
in the Death Star plans cool so that's

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,260
the other branch of the the attack tree

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:13,600
of the Death Star and that's the whole

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,840
dive star together the whole attack tree

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,950
sorry and then you have pretty much

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:23,160
three big risks in there one to get

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,410
privileged access to internal network

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,790
second one is the military attack and

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,180
the third one is dead

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,860
thermal port so let's talk about how

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,860
would you mitigate those risks

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:41,940
privileged access to the network right

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,770
impact critical if you can go to the

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,390
privileged access to the network you can

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,890
disable the Deaf star and that's really

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,170
critical for the Empire all right you

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,330
don't want to add that to happen and to

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,530
be honest given like the secure practice

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,410
of the empower they're like who is this

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,870
medium we can put like come up with a

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,050
draw inside that start by the station

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,230
connect to the network done so we need

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:07,050
to do something about the CSO right then

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,760
you come up with some some mitigations

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,710
you come up with a better out education

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,600
authorization something better then I

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,350
have a white helmet and my stormtrooper

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,150
and going right you might as well use

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,830
off zero and the door that we talked

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,540
about in the morning they might have the

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,460
RFC cards at something that was really

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,990
good

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,020
you have the facing depth it's not

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,460
because you are inside the def start

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,830
doesn't mean like you can access to

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,950
everything so it is try to put more

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:38,790
controls you do prob proper pen test in

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:41,250
your systems you do a mitigation sorry

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,140
networks segregation how the best

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,510
practices you have the network you can

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,010
apply to the Deaf stop and make really

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,460
really hard for a person that's inside

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,960
the Deaf star get access to the internal

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,080
network a privileged access to internal

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,440
network so then something that was

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,390
medium the likelihood is meat is now low

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,090
the impact is too critical but that's

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:07,230
what you can do at the moment

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:10,110
so moving on a military attack so

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,180
impacts critical if rebellion can pull

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,860
off a military tactics strong enough to

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,020
destroy the Death Star they pacts

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,090
critical and the likelihood is high

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,160
let's be honest this will they learn

00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,170
that they've started cysts they're gonna

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,540
try to destroy it and the most likely

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,200
way is just get how the ships they have

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,460
and try to blow up the Death Star

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,180
what you can do about it to mitigate

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,400
this risk one you can have like incident

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,650
response kind of procedures inside the

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,110
DEF style as soon as a military military

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,200
attack happens the people that started

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:45,480
to respond very quickly you get start

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,190
stories on call straight stories for

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,500
people who don't know is a capital ship

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,870
of the Galactic Empire they are huge

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,700
really powerful so you can't have like

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,040
some sort of page II duty kind of thing

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,230
if a military attack happens they can

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,260
fly to the Death Star support the Death

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,780
Star in a military attack and you can

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,170
monitor rebel activities right the best

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,780
way to avoid a military attack is if you

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,330
know before that so you set up how that

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,780
infrastructure you set up the the page

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,350
you do the kind of thing make sure like

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:22,050
there's very protection and you manage

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:25,140
to mitigate risk so now is it only high

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,240
so even if a rebellion can come up with

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,400
stronger military attack if the Star

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,610
Destroyer is you think you can safely

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,860
move away if the Death Star is too

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,140
damaged but not straight so the critical

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,340
for high and the likelihood now is

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:43,350
medium right because now the rebellion

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,120
knows you have better protections they

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,690
are not very likely to waste her their

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,170
whole fleet just to not to not have what

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,910
they want

00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:56,610
and finally shoot a determine port and

00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:00,330
that's one is the most complicated kind

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:04,290
of risk because most likelihood is low

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:08,880
is low because you need is a really hard

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:11,160
shot and also you are kind of relying in

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,020
security through obscurity the credit

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,480
relying the rebellion doesn't know about

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,050
that right of course

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,900
you as a CSO try to protect against that

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:25,260
but the project's are ads overdue is

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,570
already over budget you managed to put

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,010
that that likelihood low the business

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,010
sent I accept the risk

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,500
I accept the risk so the only thing you

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,360
can do is get the death star plans and

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,150
move to the Imperial security complex

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,190
it's like a big vault a planet-sized

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,600
vaults where you just put how your

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,820
plane's in there and then you hope

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,760
they're not the apples that's the best

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:59,630
you can do of course what happens and

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,010
how right you need to understand how so

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:06,950
you do forensic analysis

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:10,310
right this guy he's the hull so first

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,090
he's a bloody Jedi they're not supposed

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:17,260
to be there just something all right

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,150
then he got help from han Solo

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,310
about hunter but they're not supposed to

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,870
be doing this kind of thing right like

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:28,600
the only good money what did he do that

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:32,240
and then it gets worse because he's

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,300
priestess Leah's brother so wait a

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,800
minute it's a Jedi that's Prince's Dias

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,600
brother so he's kind of like two

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:45,580
personas together it gets worse because

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,580
he's also son of your boss

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:55,129
some kind of like a special persona

00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,129
let's say that huh

00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:03,360
also what also happens is your vote your

00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,240
imperial security complex it's not very

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,190
secure that's footage of people going

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,299
and getting the hard drive of the plans

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:18,019
right of the Death Star plans the hard

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:21,990
drive it wasn't encrypted I told you a

00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:25,200
very hard job so that's the forensic

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,029
analysis right so what you can learn

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,110
from that that's at least something you

00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:33,629
can learn thread mod model early and

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,210
often so the Death Star was a huge

00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:38,639
project and I also happens when you do

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,639
big software's they are also spent for

00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:43,470
over years so if you only want to add

00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,509
modeling that's not enough you need to

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,480
do early and often if you have done the

00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:50,730
tread modeling early you might be able

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,350
to fix the thermal parts problem if you

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,809
did at the design level you might as

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,090
well just change the design fix there

00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,830
there's a lot more cheaper you know fix

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,090
on the design level then if you fix

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:06,529
right before the production right so you

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,639
could like protect ourselves better

00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:11,309
also there are always unknowns

00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:15,659
come on who who would think about Luke

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:18,299
Skywalker the jedis were dads and why

00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:22,889
you did your boss never told you that he

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:26,460
had the son and his sisters like the

00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:30,750
rebellion princes so there how is a

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:35,240
knows right security through obscurity

00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:38,070
it's a terrible idea all right

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,750
they sometimes that happens and I have

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,279
seen many times you can discuss when

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,929
their ability of developers they come

00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,730
and say to me oh but you'll never know

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:49,830
about that it's so hidden no man that

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,049
doesn't happen when you do attacked with

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,909
his best come of the assumption they

00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,909
know as the attacker not as much as you

00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:58,500
do it's the best way because if they

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:01,890
want to know as much as you do they will

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,720
if he's a attacker to have the restorer

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,250
seasoning capabilities to do that they

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,160
will just compromise on developers

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,070
machine go to conference not that hard

00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,360
no need to like hack think period of

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,360
security complex anything like then

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,930
finally that's why I like attack trees

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,810
right it's like as I said maybe not for

00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,550
everyone not like every single scenario

00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,670
the tactic trees are the best scenario

00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:32,400
but why I like attack trees first it's a

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,640
fun exercise you make developers or

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,950
whatever defenders think like attackers

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,320
it's a very good change of mindset so

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,840
you spend years and years just building

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,780
software defending your software but how

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,970
about you think about for an hour - how

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,920
to hack your own software and that's

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,210
very interesting is very eye-opening for

00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,410
the developers they might come up with

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,780
like oh wait a minute

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,330
I can do that and we push if you have

00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,980
these in this control but we don't so

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:03,810
maybe should have right it's also a

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,940
problem-solving exercise and come on

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,580
developers there are problem solvers by

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,080
default right you put a problem in front

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,270
of developers what you're gonna do is

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,710
solve it doesn't matter what it is if

00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,440
you talk about rocket science there's

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,530
going to try to solve it and that's very

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,670
nice very fun it compared like two other

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,820
ways of to try the mall or president

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,380
which tried that's more of a checklist

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,120
developers get bored very easily if it's

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,660
a process you want to do early and often

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,090
you need to be something there are

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:36,360
likely to do and likely to feel good

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:40,130
about it at least not hate it and I

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,360
think strides can make that a bit hard

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,920
it's a very interesting it decides if

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,540
you get the right people in the room you

00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,840
have everyone who is building that

00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,900
software developers security operations

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,210
to talk about security for one or two

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,790
hours and that's really really powerful

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,770
because when you leave their room you

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,230
want to talk about those risks everybody

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,970
got together on the same conclusion if

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,110
something was critical it's really hard

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,900
for developer say no there's not

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,300
critical come on in the room it's cause

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,340
that together this is critical remember

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,960
that I remember the discussion so when

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,100
you need to prioritize that back to the

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,420
developers backlog

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,280
it's a lot easier the others

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:22,710
they were there maybe was their

00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:33,360
suggestion alright that's it for my talk

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:33,990
may the force be with you thank you very

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,220
much

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,960
thank you I think that it's the most

00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,240
entertaining version of threat modeling

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
I've ever seen and I think you need to

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,560
share this video when it shows up

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,500
probably tomorrow at this point with all

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,340
your colleagues do we have any questions

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,720
we've got go away notifications we've

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,050
got a couple of minutes so we can fit a

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,050
few in

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,250
fantastic presentation have you tried

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:14,050
this I guess approach for threat

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,210
modeling possibly even actually using a

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,770
Death Star example with people who

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,900
aren't normally engaged like I don't

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,800
know the executive or the business or

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,560
people who aren't as strongly technical

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,810
sometimes product managers that try it

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,800
but usually I try the example I try is

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:34,090
rob a bank it's just for science

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,670
it's like it's not I'm trying to get any

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,380
ideas or something but it's something I

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,120
try to use something that's one of the

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,610
benefits of the factory's different form

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,800
is trial for example you can apply in

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,780
different ways and Bank something they

00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,640
have a bar thinks about you go to a bank

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,050
branch everybody knows how it works or

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,610
have a bar things about security and

00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,350
then you go to a branch is like oh I

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,300
could do this I could practice to the

00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,350
money from here everybody like has this

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,730
kind of ideas and it's very interesting

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,530
to hear about them like some ideas is

00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:10,000
pretty hard like wow you actually

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:12,040
thought about that so yeah it's an

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,810
interesting way but usually when I'm

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,800
even for developers if the first time I

00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,170
run into them

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,700
I go to an example like that's quick and

00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,430
easy so they get the idea how the

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,440
process works and then we then we go for

00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,910
the software if you just talk about the

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,890
tack trees if you don't give an example

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,320
is really hard to reason about like a

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,090
goes and branches and how it goes but if

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,430
you do something that's quick and easy

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:38,350
usually they get the idea we've come

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:42,990
probably fit in one more if there's

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,990
anyone with a question anyone

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,960
if no one else mind so I guess the other

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,309
thing I've seen occasionally happened

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,870
with threat modeling is it focused very

00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,789
much on the technical points of entry

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,460
likes a very low level like mitre attack

00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:03,960
style to offensiveness how do you get

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,880
the right people in the room for the

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,140
possible goals and motivations and

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,549
really understanding what's making

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,630
people tick and understanding those

00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:18,510
options there's a complicated question

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,799
so the way I like to think about is what

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,070
you're trying to protect

00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:25,350
right whatever it is if I start trying

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,330
to talk about software usually means

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,880
developers operations some other people

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,220
if I talk about the security of your

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,010
office you might come up with the office

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,590
manager as well and the people and the

00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,450
InfoSec people in your organization so

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,590
it depends what they are trying to

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,260
protect against you need to get

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,450
different people and they might be kinda

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,940
been intimidated at first all right

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,309
what is that about why I'm here so we

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,650
need to get a good introduction of the

00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,860
process why white people are there and

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,679
hopefully they have some fun doing in it

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:03,480
but yeah does that answer your question

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,970
cool thanks again thank you hand of

00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,769
applause and then I'll let you all go

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,769
