Title: "Post-mortems: Building better software together." - Thomi Richards (PyCon AU 2019)
Publication date: 2019-08-03
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Thomi Richards

Improving the reliability of complex software requires more than just reacting to the latest issue. In this talk weâ€™ll learn how you and your team can work together to build a post-mortem process that helps you identify and fix systematic flaws in your environment.

so welcome everybody to this last

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,960
session in this block before lunch I'd

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,490
like you to all welcome

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,049
Tommy Richards to the stage and and he's

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,719
going to talk to us about post-mortems

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:22,680
building better software together thank

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:25,740
you so you know we're gonna talk about

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,449
post-mortems but I'm gonna cheat I'm

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,039
gonna like switch things around and

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,769
actually not talk about post-mortems for

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,030
ages because this context we have to

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,809
talk about we can't talk about

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,570
post-mortems

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,250
until we talk about how we think about

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,770
building software how we think about

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,100
being an engineer and what it is that we

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,070
actually do in our day jobs

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,570
so what mental model do we use when we

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,010
think about being a programmer when we

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,550
think about software and how software

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,739
works I want to suggest that the primary

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,230
model we use is we think of software

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,350
like it's a complicated machine we think

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,049
it has lots of moving parts that sort of

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,460
cooperate together in order to form a

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,920
system that does something useful that

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,299
we want and the analogy I'm going for

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,070
here is the internal combustion engine

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,830
but it doesn't really matter but it's

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,189
it's a okay analogy so we'll stick with

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,070
that for now an engine has lots of parts

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,810
and if your car starts making funny

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,700
noises unless you're mechanically minded

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,320
it's probably not a good idea for you to

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,960
start ripping it apart to try and figure

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,700
out what's wrong instead you take it to

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,060
a mechanic you take it to someone who

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,750
has the skill training expertise in

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,460
order to know how that system works not

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,590
only do they know how the system works

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,960
but they have enough skilled that they

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,020
can predict the impact of their actions

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,899
on that system so they know that when

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,579
they I'm not a car person so like I

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,049
don't actually have that you know when

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,149
they do this thing over here with the

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,939
grease and the engine and the motor and

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,850
you know something useful happens and I

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,110
don't know cars but you know they can

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,240
make that prediction and if they're a

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,380
good engineer it usually works out for

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,720
the best I think we think the same way

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,069
as software engineers right we think

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,749
it's just software sure it's complicated

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,549
but like we're all good engineers we

00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:17,650
have the expertise we know that if we

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:21,219
make this change over here the impact is

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,370
going to be what we want but things

00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:27,189
break all the time software is

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,000
notoriously unreliable so when things

00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,889
break it costs us energy costs us loss

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,030
of revenue it cost us loss of reputation

00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:39,519
and we ought to have a good hard think

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,840
about what it is that's gone wrong so

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,099
that we can learn something because when

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,079
things break it's often a great

00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,489
opportunity to learn something new about

00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:49,930
the system that you're working on that

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:52,780
you didn't know before so if we have

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,239
this mental model going in that a

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,760
sufficiently skilled practitioner can

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,090
identify the impact of their changes

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,010
before they make it and that cause and

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,739
effect in the system are sort of

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,540
reliably determinable and it's only

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,129
natural that when something breaks we

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,889
sort of look at the outage and we work

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,689
backwards through the causal chain until

00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,019
we figure out what the root cause was

00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,699
right this is root cause analysis and so

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,439
we might convene a meeting of all the

00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,269
important people at our company and we

00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,689
might say right you know production went

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,849
down let's say that the company that I

00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,739
work for was a P OLAP like our front

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,959
page went down zapier comms was

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,069
completely dead so why did the site go

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,419
down well the site went down because

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,280
there was some production code deployed

00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:40,509
that was trying to access a database

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,269
column that didn't exist

00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,790
ouch that's not good well why did the

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,500
database column not exist

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,959
well the database column didn't exist

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,609
because the migration that added the

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,400
database column hadn't been run before

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:56,680
the code had been deployed yeah that's

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,389
not what we want why did the migration

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,849
not been running well the migration

00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,040
hadn't been run because it's a manual

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,870
process and the engineer responsible for

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,729
running it didn't run the migration it

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,340
said to me right I forgot to run the

00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:11,199
migration so we've done this root cause

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,840
analysis we've sort of narrowed down

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,280
we followed the causal chain until we've

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,199
gotten to a point where we've identified

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,000
the problem I'm a bad engineer only

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,270
there's many problems with that right

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,129
first of all if cause and effect at a

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,530
of all for someone with sufficient skill

00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:32,229
and we've identified that the root cause

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,550
is that I didn't do something or you

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,430
know that I should have done or I did

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,500
something wrong then the sort of logical

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,479
unspoken conclusion is I don't have

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,909
sufficient skill right I'm a bad

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,620
engineer and that's going to make me

00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:46,930
feel bad and it's not going to make me

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,330
particularly enthusiastic about you know

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,319
engaging with engineering in my

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:57,009
organization in the future second of all

00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:58,569
if you perform this kind of analysis you

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,340
broadcast to the rest of your

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,650
organization that this is what happens

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,180
when you make a mistake right you better

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,099
not make a mistake because if you do

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,949
your name will be the punchline on an

00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:11,289
analysis document and no one wants that

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,389
and so all of a sudden people start

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,220
playing politics right no one wants to

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,050
own up to their mistakes people will

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,030
make it look like it was someone else's

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,139
fault you know it's that team over there

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,770
they're the ones that caused the

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:26,590
problems not us and finally when you

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:30,819
engage in this sort of reductive root

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:33,550
cause analysis a lot of the times if you

00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:38,469
end up at a conclusion that is a

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:40,270
technical system then frequently the fix

00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:43,479
that you will identify will be really

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,940
narrow in scope right because you start

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,830
out with this sort of broad view and

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,210
you're constantly following those causal

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,569
chains to earn more and more specific

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,029
effects at best you will find something

00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:57,460
that marginally improves your resiliency

00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:59,050
but does not offer the kind of scalable

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,310
improvement that we want in order to

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,599
keep our systems working a slight

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,460
digression and some audience

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,319
participation raise your hand if you've

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,880
seen this diagram before and know what

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,449
it is okay

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,909
two people right for the rest of you

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:18,039
this is the sort of central diagram for

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:20,139
a decision-making framework called the

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,460
Caernarvon framework and I wish I had

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,020
more time because it's really

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,169
interesting and required reading you

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,110
really ought to go and read about it but

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:32,820
the framework exists to help leaders

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,469
decide how to respond to a problem and

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,880
the central insight is that the way you

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,770
respond to a problem should be

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,770
determined by the type of system that

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,050
you're working in

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,750
and conovan defines four different

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,940
domains of systems and they're

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,129
categorized by how cause and effect are

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,509
linked in those systems and this model

00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:53,780
that I've just described of the

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,849
complicated machine exists in the

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,250
complicated model where cause and effect

00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:00,129
are determinable in advance but perhaps

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,930
only by people with sufficient skill

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:05,090
right you and I unless you're

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,770
mechanically minded maybe don't know

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,740
what's causing your car engine to go

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,280
weird but a mechanic does because they

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,990
have the skill I want to propose that

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,569
software engineering the thing we do

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,909
when we mash the keys and produce Python

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:23,210
code every day exists in the complex

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:25,310
domain the complex domain contains

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,539
systems where cause and effect are not

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:32,210
determinable in advance that sentence

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:35,840
should scare you right I'm saying as

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,229
engineers we cannot be 100% sure of the

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,349
impact of the changes that we're making

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:43,699
systems in the complex domain include

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,860
ecosystems right places where the

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,740
behavior that you want if the system is

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,319
a property of the connections between

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,479
conscious agents a business organization

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,860
is a great example of a system in the

00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:00,680
complex domain this might seem like a

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,650
bit of a stretch right I'm saying like

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,840
writing code is somehow got something to

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,810
do with like a sort of network of

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,120
conscious agents what the hell well I

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,300
think there's two reasons why we maybe

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,699
think this is impractical or not quite

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,240
the case and the first is to do with the

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:24,979
way that we think about writing code we

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:30,580
have this idea that in our jobs we write

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:33,529
code by which I mean we sit at our desks

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,510
you know we think we mash the keys we

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,940
commit to production and it's this

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,849
one-way process right code flows out of

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,969
your brain into production and then you

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,350
repeat the cycle the problem is that

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,579
before you can write the code you need

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,279
to understand the code that you're

00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:51,589
changing and in order to do that you

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,740
need to build a mental model and sort of

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,959
mental abstraction

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,880
if you will of the code that you're

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,880
working on and in order to do that you

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,520
need to read the code so first of all we

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,440
build this abstract mental model once we

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,170
have that hopefully it's good right

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,760
hopefully it's accurate enough we have

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,700
our model we have the change we want to

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,800
make and we say ah I know with this

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,600
model if I change this bit over here all

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,959
right if I add this function change this

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,149
class whatever it is then the impact of

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,800
my change will be what I want you know

00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,830
this bug will be fixed or this new

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,720
feature will be added so in a very real

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,270
sense we change the code but the code

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,580
changes us write the code that you read

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,339
informs the mental model that you build

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,570
and it's not just you it's you and

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,990
everyone else that works on that

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:43,649
codebase right every function name every

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,839
comment every log message every error

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,209
report that you get in sentry every

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,279
metric on your dashboard helps inform

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,610
your and your colleagues mental models

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:56,880
of the system that you're operating on

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,770
so you have formed this network of

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,510
conscious agents right you're reacting

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,880
to your colleagues changes just as

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,089
they're reacting to yours but you're not

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,510
like communicating in a natural language

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,610
like English you're communicating in

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:15,839
Python and function names and alert

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:18,180
names the second reason and the far more

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,829
sort of prosaic reason why software

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,100
engineering is in the complex domain is

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,600
software's built by teams right software

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,829
hasn't been built by individuals for

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:32,010
many many years and if we ignore the

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:35,520
problems that can come from process from

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,500
communication from team dynamics in our

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,779
incident analysis then we ignore an

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,750
entire class of errors that often

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:47,480
produce really serious outages so if

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,649
I've convinced you and I hope I have

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,020
that software engineering is in this

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,720
complex domain the question arises how

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,730
on earth can we operate when cause and

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,620
effect unknowable and advance right this

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,079
sounds crazy

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,570
well connivance is the way you do this

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,540
is you follow this loop of probe since

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,490
respond probe meaning you try a thing

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,300
right you form a hypothesis you say I

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,920
think doing X will have this impact

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,579
sense meaning me see if it worked

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,920
did it work yes or no respond being if

00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,380
it did work let's do more of that and if

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,029
it didn't work let's do less of that if

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,770
this is starting to sound like agile

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,589
development methodology you're not wrong

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,270
you know this idea of tight iterations

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,010
always trying to build on top of what

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,020
you've already learned I mean we do this

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,570
already as an industry this is just a

00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:42,720
sort of interesting reframing of the

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:45,449
same problem so what would an incident

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,070
analysis look like with this different

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:51,779
mental model instead of doing root cause

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,910
analysis instead of sort of drilling

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,089
down and down until we find a single

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,160
point of failure we look at the systems

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,470
that help inform the mental models that

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,459
people build right we assume good intent

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,870
on the part of our engineering team here

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,550
if any of our engineering team are

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,520
malicious that is a or you know

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,440
negligent or undertrained or something

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,520
like that's a process for HR and

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,180
management but we ask two questions we

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,490
ask what systems prevented us from sort

00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,860
of probing usefully right from executing

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,839
that probe part of the three steps in

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,850
other words what systems prevented us

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,410
from running an experiment safely from

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,380
treating the changes that we're about to

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,600
make as an experimental change and the

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,910
second question we ask is what systems

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,339
prevented us from sensing the impact of

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,020
that change accurately what systems

00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,829
provided us with misleading information

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,779
or missing information so for that same

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,920
hypothetical outages before we might

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,959
start coming up with some really

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,060
interesting insights we might say well

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,190
the site went down because we deployed

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,959
some bad code but you know bad codes

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,029
gonna happen it happens all the time but

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,740
the site went down because we deployed

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,199
the bad code to all of our production

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,850
servers at once right maybe we need to

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,949
start having conversations about phase

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,770
deploys or feature flags or things of

00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:14,130
this nature this is a failure of of us

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,700
not being able to experiment

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,320
we might also say well there's clearly a

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,770
sort of missing piece of information

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,230
here

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,770
you know the engineer who pushed this

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,230
change did not have sufficient

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,240
signposting to be told that you know

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,330
their change is going to cause a big

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,800
problem so maybe we need something in

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:40,570
our CI CD pipeline this sort of thing so

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,450
this is all hypothetical but you know we

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,210
can it's very hard to sort of give

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,060
accurate useful examples for a

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,920
hypothetical outage because the details

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,080
are what really matters right the nuance

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,120
of the particular situation is is what's

00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:00,130
interesting here so with that context

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,230
out of the way let's talk about running

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,640
a post-mortem

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,700
how should I run my own post-mortem

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,880
process annoyingly the answer I'm

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,500
convinced is it depends we can all go to

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,180
lunch now it depends on the software

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,950
that you're building it depends on who

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,490
your customers are what price point your

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,370
customers paying it depends on what your

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:28,330
company culture is right what problems

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,530
are you trying to solve here so what I'm

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,210
going to do is I'm going to tell you

00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,450
about some of the things that we do is a

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,790
peer when we're running our post-mortems

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,800
and I'm gonna try and tell you why we do

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,570
those things in order to help you

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,490
understand the context around those

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,320
decisions so that you can sort of figure

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:48,670
out if it's something useful that you

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,470
maybe also would like to do the first

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,990
thing that I think is really important

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,910
is to clearly separate in your minds the

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,480
concept of incident response from

00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,460
incident analysis incident responses oh

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,920
my god productions broken let's fix it

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,620
right now right the most important thing

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,740
is to get your customers back into their

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,250
happy world of a product that is useful

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,870
to them and is worth paying money for

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,760
incident analysis the point is not to

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,560
figure out what went wrong the point is

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,870
to improve your resiliency over time

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,580
make it less likely that things are

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,800
going to break in the future it's

00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,050
totally fine if the things that you

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,630
decide to change as a result of your

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,300
incident

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,410
analysis are not connected to the things

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,410
that broke in the first place

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:41,290
the second thing we do at Sofia which I

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:46,400
want to talk about is we have trained

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,050
analysis facilitators so for a whole

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,570
bunch of reasons that I'll get into in a

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,090
second we believe that having trained

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,790
individuals run the analysis process is

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:59,510
a requirement in order to have a good

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,690
result out of the post-mortem so the

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,700
facilitators job is to keep conversation

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,680
on track right and make sure that

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,750
everyone involved has this sort of

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,760
complex domain frame of mind and

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,800
understands why we're doing this and

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,710
what kinds of questions were interested

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,840
in answering their job is to ask

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,310
questions that dig at a deeper truth and

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,320
make sure that as a group we're not

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,940
satisfied with the sort of surface level

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,980
ideas that we bring but that we're

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,100
really analyzing the the individual

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:32,090
points their job is to ensure that

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,460
everyone in the process has an

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,530
opportunity to give input and that their

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,200
input is heard and understood and

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,330
received they're there to ensure that we

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,520
get good participation from all parts of

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,660
the company and that we're not just

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,730
analyzing our outages from an

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,650
engineering perspective or from an SRE

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,590
perspective but that we're bringing the

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,090
whole company together and finally

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,430
they're there to guide people through

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,720
the process right this can be scary

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,180
especially if you haven't done it before

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,550
we don't want it to be scary we want it

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,380
to be a positive thing that you look

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,270
forward to being a part of and so a

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,670
large part of the facilitators job is

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:13,579
just to you know calm people down and be

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:17,810
that friendly face so we start our

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,930
process 24 hours after the outage

00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,030
occurred roughly outage or incident or

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:26,060
whatever went wrong and we do this for a

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,920
few reasons first of all responding to

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,990
an outage is really hard right it can be

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,930
stressful it can require that you work

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,360
late and we want you to have an

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:38,060
opportunity to go home to your family

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,310
relaxed you know just come to the

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,560
analysis session with a

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,150
mind and not be carrying that emotional

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,670
baggage and that stress into the

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,220
analysis session and the second reason

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,200
why we do this is zappy as a globally

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,400
distributed 100 percent remote company

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,120
and so we have to care about time zones

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,340
and the time of day when people were at

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,560
work to respond to a production problem

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,030
it's highly likely to also be the time

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,580
of the day when they're able to come

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,890
along to an analysis session so baking

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,580
in that 24-hour delay achieves those two

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,550
goals for us so at the appointed time

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,180
the facilitator will start a video

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:20,550
conference call and invite all of the

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,020
people that we think should be there and

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,540
you know doing this via videoconference

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,450
may seem like a weird thing for a 100

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,420
percent remote company to do we live and

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,040
die by our ability to communicate

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,450
asynchronously right we're spread out

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,160
around the globe if we can't communicate

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,320
asynchronously we can't get anything

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,530
done but this is one of those places

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,990
where I think the benefits of having

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,970
people in the same room talking

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,220
face-to-face at the same time far

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,720
outweigh the costs the magic here

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,400
happens when we have different people

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,840
from different walks of life building on

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,030
top of ideas that each other have

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,160
contributed and you can't do that

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,490
asynchronously at least not with in a

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:03,210
sensible timeframe so the call starts

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,010
the facilitator introduces the process

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,650
make sure that everyone understands what

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,780
we're doing and why we're doing that and

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,880
this is the first time where the

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,100
facilitator will refer to something that

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,750
we call the facilitators handbook which

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,960
you can think of it like speaker notes

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,920
for the post mortem process and so one

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,230
of the things that we have in that

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,200
handbook is example language that you

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,760
can use to kick off the call and we

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,190
found that the specific language that

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,720
you use can make a huge impact into how

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,190
people think about the call and the

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,280
kinds of suggestions that you're likely

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,470
to get and you're already really busy as

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,780
a facilitator so having to not like

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,940
remember to hit those talking points and

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,720
instead just be able to read out of a of

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,780
a hand book is a huge help so we get

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,780
everyone settled down and we begin

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,330
and we begin by collaboratively editing

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:58,090
a document and the first thing we do is

00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,010
we make an objective record of

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,110
everything that happened so we care

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,410
about things that we did and things that

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:08,080
we saw we put people's names and we put

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,250
timestamps in UTC because again time

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,860
zones are something we have to care

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:16,480
about time zones so as a facilitator

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,930
here there's this sort of two things

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,190
that you're making sure to do above and

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,920
beyond just making sure to capture

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,030
everyone's suggestions first of all you

00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,640
have to make sure that you get input

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,290
from everyone on the call so if we've

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,850
done our job right we'll have a mix of

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:35,260
people with different job titles and

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:38,110
what you'll find is that sre people tend

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,540
to talk about pager Duty alerts and

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,460
infrastructure problems developers will

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,830
be talking about github pull requests

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,690
and production deploys support people

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,310
will be talking about ticket escalations

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,020
and ticket queues and things like this

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,970
so we want to make sure that we capture

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,180
all of those different perspectives and

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,130
put them on the timeline the second

00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,640
thing we care about is that we have cast

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,220
our mind far back in time enough that we

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,570
have captured symptoms that maybe at the

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,340
time weren't apparent that they were

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,200
leading up to the outage but with the

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,150
benefit of hindsight we can see that oh

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,860
yeah like that system that's been

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,900
complaining at us for the last week and

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,450
we thought was just benign actually

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,210
wasn't and it was a big problem so we

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,850
always make sure you know like we think

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,560
about maybe 24 hours maybe a week

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,630
earlier are there anything any other

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,820
instances that we need to include in

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:34,090
this timeline once we have that done we

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:38,670
move on to the majority part of the

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:43,180
report which is the systems analysis and

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:47,080
here this is the hard part for the

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,240
facilitator again we are very careful to

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,880
introduce the section with some very

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,970
careful language where we remind people

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,950
why we explicitly do not care about root

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,840
cause analysis we're not trying to

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,190
figure out what went wrong we're trying

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,010
to figure out what prevented us from

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,410
experimenting safely what gave us

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:09,190
mentally the wrong idea about what the

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,260
state of the system was in and so people

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,650
will be calling out all sorts of things

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,690
right support people if saris developers

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,850
they'll all have their opinions and as a

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,980
facilitator you're madly trying to type

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,870
you're trying to ask questions that sort

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,640
of dig at a deeper truth this is where

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,080
techniques like the five wise or the

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,100
infinite house that you may have heard

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,780
about can be used I'm not personally a

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,390
big fan of them but you can ask me about

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,920
that in the hallway we have in the

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,140
facilitators handbook a list of

00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,360
prompting questions that you can use if

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,860
you're stuck right if you're trying to

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,450
think about you know what haven't we

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,010
thought about with this particular

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,690
problem we're asking everyone to help

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,670
take notes it's a very collaborative

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,960
process it doesn't really feel like

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:58,510
analysis it feels like brainstorming the

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,730
section can take 30 minutes 40 minutes

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,740
an hour depending on the size and scale

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,990
of the outage but there come a point

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:09,520
where the suggestions start to dry up

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:12,670
and almost always people now have a

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,020
sufficient understanding of what

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,180
happened and what everyone was thinking

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:20,950
about and why we took the actions that

00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:22,720
we did and it's really really common

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,790
that at this point there are two or

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,850
three things that really stand out as

00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,710
being sort of partial chord causes of

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,590
the outage right two or three systems

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,420
that failed us in some big way that led

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,610
us down the wrong path led us to take

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,480
the wrong actions and eventually led us

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,420
to disaster and so we capture those

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,590
right we want to fix that stuff we try

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,960
and fix things that are low cost effects

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,390
and high impact and you'd be surprised

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,330
like a lot of the times it's really

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,820
really simple stuff like the text on an

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,370
alert is perhaps a bit ambiguous it's a

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,760
bit misleading and in that moment of

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,010
panic as production is raining down and

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,290
flaming chunks around you like you you

00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,600
don't have time to think you know you're

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,700
being reactive to the problem and a

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,360
misleading alert sample is something as

00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,519
simple as the text just maybe not quite

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,260
being as accurate as it should be can I

00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,010
have a huge consequence if it causes you

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,080
to then take the wrong decision so this

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,679
is kind of the boring part of the

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,570
process because it's you know internal

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,970
stuff we make sure we have a JIRA ticket

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,630
or we make sure it gets prioritized on a

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,190
team's backlog we record owners I'm sure

00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:43,960
you will do this in your organization's

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,210
already the postmodern facilitators

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,269
follow up on this stuff right we want to

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,429
make sure that these things get fixed

00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:53,019
and so we from time to time will come

00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,309
along and make sure that you know they

00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:55,950
are actually getting fixed and we are

00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:58,419
actually improving going forwards and

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,789
this is the end of the call for the

00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:04,090
participants it's not the end of the

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:07,029
process for the poor facilitators they

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:10,990
have a few more things to do the first

00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:13,539
is they post the document that we've

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,830
built along with a recording of the

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:17,980
video conference to the rest of the

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,139
company we have an internal blog but the

00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,380
important thing here is that again time

00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:26,260
zones not everyone can attend the

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,029
analysis session right and we need to

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,799
make sure that we communicate what we

00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:31,510
talked about and why we decided to

00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,220
change the things that we did why we

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:36,130
pick these action items to the rest of

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:40,090
the company so that's the first piece of

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:43,059
administrivia but the other and I think

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,179
possibly the most important thing is we

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:49,090
ask other facilitators for feedback so

00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:51,190
after every session we'll ask each other

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,169
hey here's a link to the video recording

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,570
what could I have done better right how

00:25:53,169 --> 00:26:02,019
can we improve often the discussion that

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,490
happens in this feedback is like well we

00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,470
think you know if you'd asked this

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,179
question at this time stamp in the video

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,070
maybe we could have had a discussion

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,519
down a different line of inquiry that we

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,960
missed sometimes we'll say oh yeah like

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,549
actually the process that we're

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,470
following isn't working anymore for us

00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:19,330
you know maybe some other company

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,299
process has changed and so we need to

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:25,600
react to that if you forget everything

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:28,059
else I've said today I highly recommend

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
that you remember this right however you

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,220
do

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,470
or post-mortems however you do your

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,870
incident analysis make sure that you

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,390
sort of baked into the process a way to

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,700
change the process itself because your

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,559
analysis has to reflect the software

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,539
that you're building the culture of your

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,520
company the people that you're working

00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:47,770
with the size and scale of your company

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,419
and if you don't have a way to change it

00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,940
at best you'll have a process that works

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,679
for you today and fails for you when

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,080
you're you know when your company has

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,850
changed or your software has changed so

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,120
keep yourself flexible think of it like

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:05,740
a sprint retrospective but for your post

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,419
mortem process and now that is the end

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,070
of the process and then we get to do it

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,470
all over again when production breaks

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,630
next time

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:20,200
so we're very nearly at the end of the

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:21,370
talk I have a slide here where I am like

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,500
I don't feel like I've done anything

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,419
particularly novel here there's a few

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,309
ideas that I've maybe tried to sort of

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:30,100
weave together that perhaps haven't been

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,620
brought together before but here is a

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,330
long list of things that I highly

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,360
recommend you read if you're interested

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:41,169
in the conovan framework there's a bunch

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,049
of resources here on complex systems and

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:46,690
samantha c and post-mortems and all

00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,179
sorts of things if you're right now

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,980
thinking Tommy you idiot like there's no

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,340
URLs here how am i can know where these

00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:57,190
things are I got you covered because

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,750
there's the talk slides thank you very

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,940
much you've been a great audience I

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,280
think I have miraculously like a couple

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,360
of minutes for questions so if anyone

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,360
has one hit me up

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:22,550
out there any questions in the room any

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:28,520
questions down the yeah you mentioned

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:30,500
the the handbook a lot yes you develop

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,110
that internally yourself

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,470
yeah is that something that's yeah so we

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:40,400
we built it internally for a couple of

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,010
reasons first of all our process changes

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,990
quite a lot and so it's really useful to

00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,490
have a one you know a single source of

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,870
truth

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,670
we have facilitators spread around the

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,230
globe and so it's quite hard to get all

00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,600
of us in a call at the same time in

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,190
order to coordinate those changes so by

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,740
having a single artifact that we can

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,260
change and then like that is the process

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,640
that we follow helps us a lot but yeah

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,190
we're always changing the handbook as

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,990
well you know we'll add new question

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,030
prompts will slightly tweak the language

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:13,750
when we have to yeah okay thanks and

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,750
there was one up the back

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,460
hey thanks the talk really interesting

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,900
the question I had was around he said

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,520
when you call that meeting you get the

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,440
right people in the room I was wondering

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,480
what you used to judge the right people

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,120
for that meeting yeah it's a good

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,190
question

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,340
primarily it's about getting a good mix

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,500
of roles so that personally the thing

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,200
that I care about most is that we don't

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,450
fill it up with back in engineers right

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,720
or all front-end engineers or all SRA

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,520
people I think you'd be surprised at how

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,860
much additional value you get from

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,620
people in non like traditional

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,510
engineering roles so having a member

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,930
from our support team in our post

00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:02,050
mortems is hugely valuable like it makes

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:05,440
a huge difference so I think having that

00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:08,140
diversity of sort of perspective on your

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,480
product is the most important thing and

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,590
then beyond that you know maybe getting

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,150
people who haven't been part of the

00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:16,240
process before getting a mix of

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,700
experienced employees and relatively new

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,070
employees just trying to make sure that

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,350
you're not getting the same group of

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,240
people in the room over and over and

00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,350
over again and you're getting a bit of

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,300
diversity of thought I think we're out

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,550
of time for questions sorry come talk to

00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,809
me in the hallway thank you

00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,809
