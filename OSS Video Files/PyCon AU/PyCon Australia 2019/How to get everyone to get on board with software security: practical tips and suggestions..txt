welcome back everyone so this is our

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,050
last talk of the day following this will

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,309
be the panel which if you want to get

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,190
any questions in you've probably got

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,599
another 20 minutes or so before we will

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,980
miss them anyway

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,470
but there's all signs around up the

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,439
doors to tell you how to submit any but

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,880
for now we have a talk on getting people

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:32,279
engaged with Tennessee

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:34,079
so please welcome him thanks for thank

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,700
you all very much for coming I'm aware

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,370
there's a talk on next door on how to

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,020
interface do brain computer interfacing

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,320
with Python so the fact that anyone is

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,300
here at all I count as a major win ok so

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,879
these are some of my worst slides but

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,410
some of my best content in addition this

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,149
is the second time I've given the talk

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,160
and at about 10 o'clock last night I

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,820
became convinced I needed to rewrite the

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,739
entire thing and I did so what it meets

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,930
shows is that I really care about what's

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,449
in it but it does mean that the slide

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,280
presentation has suffered slightly in

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,869
the passion and enthusiasm for

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,630
communicating the the correct

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,310
information so focus on the data not the

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,799
content so I don't have all the answers

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,720
nothing is easy only some of what I try

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,189
ended up working out I want to

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,990
acknowledge that in some environments

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,509
you can't change things and there's a

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,330
lot of effort in recognizing when to

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,770
push and when to wait but none of that

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,409
has stopped me from having an opinion

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,860
and so here they are this isn't about

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,630
any organization or employer its

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,820
gathered from like multiple places I've

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,530
worked many many people I've talked to

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,900
I've never met anyone who doesn't have

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,880
problems in this area slash

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,790
opportunities in this area so it really

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,040
is a universal set of data that I've

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,340
drawn on and bringing this together and

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,229
for anyone who is copyright oriented all

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,820

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,170
doesn't require attribution which seems

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,490
weird but there you have it so I'm going

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,500
to start by talking about big

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,969
achievements in general ok so these

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,829
aren't necessarily software security

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,990
examples but they're just kind of

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,629
generally awesome how does a generally

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,009
awesome thing happen at all is kind of

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,050
where I want to start with so let's talk

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,590
about one someone managed to get a

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,750
deeper

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,670
plus test coverage in a large legacy

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,010
application that started life with no

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,290
tests added a three month delay to a

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,849
massive project despite major objections

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,069
from the business and others on the team

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,840
how does someone do that that doesn't

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,970
normally happen when I face that much

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,040
objection how did they manage to pull

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,489
that off

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,959
other examples organizing a new team

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,330
establishing anything getting anything

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,580
over the line is incredibly hard who's

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,000
actually tried recently try to convince

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,060
anybody else of anything at all

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,650
that they didn't believe in beforehand

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,799
this is the essence of the challenge I'm

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,450
really trying to get at so let's think

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,130
for a minute about our own experience

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,140
when was a time you really committed and

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,180
just went all-in on something why did

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,540
you commit did someone tell you to

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,579
did you read something I'm willing to

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,760
bet it's because you decided for

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,579
yourself that it was worth it you did

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,349
you didn't you know perhaps someone else

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:15,840
incepted the idea in you instigated it

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,310
recommended it tasked you with etc but

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,859
I'm willing that the commitment came

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,239
from your decision and I'm willing to

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,340
bet that if that's what happened for you

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,040
it's probably what happens for other

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:31,049
people as well the rest of the talk is

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,239
just footnote we're done okay well we're

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,370
not done actually this is like planning

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,799
a heist getting somebody on board with

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,959
something you're going to need a team

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,609
it's not something you can do alone and

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,500
just to be really clear these people

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,410
don't work for you you're going to need

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,049
an objective it's complex and as the

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,599
hero of the story you're going to need

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,919
to pull it together you're going to need

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,410
to start by understanding where you are

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,630
who else is involved what their

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,630
interests and motivations are and how to

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,000
get them to take an interest you

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,079
probably won't have much time left to

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,819
code okay it's like a game of chess it's

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,919
going to take time and there's a lot of

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,650
moves so what does this have to do

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:18,239
specifically with software security well

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,950
in a way nothing ok there's this penny

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,229
drop moment where you realize that if

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,659
you've got the right people strategy the

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,940
technical strategy will emerge from

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,270
those people if you get the right people

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
in

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,810
volved and motivated and whatever it is

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,699
you want to achieve you don't

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,310
necessarily need to solve the problem

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,599
anymore and the way to start working on

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,270
what those other people are thinking

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,979
about is start with the easy wins who's

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,940
been told to start with an easy win

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,259
before yes oh hey and and people are

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,000
having to put up hands at the same time

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,770
so half of the room has heard that they

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,940
should start with an easy win and is

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,500
willing to put up their hand which means

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,699
that the whole room has actually heard

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,960
start with the easy okay so big things

00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,550
are just little things start together

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,169
this is why people tell you to but it

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,120
took me actually quite a long time to

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,470
figure out why people kept saying start

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,500
with the easy wins and no one would ever

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,330
break it down for me so what when they

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,490
say start with the easy wins might they

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,139
really be might they really mean and I

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,699
really wish someone had just like broken

00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,280
this out for me so this is one of my too

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,840
busy to small font busy slides but it

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
really does talk about what I think is

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,860
at the essence of thinking about how to

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,680
make progress with groups of people so

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,599
first up my mind always starts with the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,639
unstated concerns if someone says start

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,199
on the easy wins I'm like okay you're

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,909
not buying what I'm selling I've heard

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
you okay so then why not have much

00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,120
interest and why not be sure I can do it

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
they don't understand what I'm driving

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,810
at or they basically just have no idea

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,539
what I'm talking about and why they

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,699
might want to do it often that signifies

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,990
some kind of awareness problem on the

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,199
other hand there are real benefits of

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,479
starting with easy wins and I used to

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,599
think what they meant was do the easy

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,490
win and then I'll buy in but it turns

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,680
out there's still a lot of work left

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,389
after you've actually got the easy win

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,550
over the line the easy win does not in

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,520
fact lead to profit the easy win leads

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,050
to more work the more work is you've got

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
something to talk about you can

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,409
demonstrate your ability to plan and

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,810
scope work you can demonstrate your

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:14,370
ability to deliver actually getting

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,110
something done is more useful than doing

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,770
nothing and it's easier to get approved

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,960
so the next step is the leverage so how

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,729
leverage actually works is going to be

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,900
about the individual motivations of the

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,880
people that you're talking to when

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,330
you're working with in a technical

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,279
audience it may be enough to explain

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,750
technically how your solution leads to a

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:35,490
greater outcome if the people are

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,509
already locked roared Lee speaking on

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,539
board with it and broadly speaking

00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,160
technical a simple explanation of if we

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,920
do this we will reduce the

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,810
of arras go okay they may already be

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,910
invested in that particular outcome but

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,730
they may not you may need to go to

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,100
meetings present slides have

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,260
opportunities for little learnings it's

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,420
a little bit pithy to call and little

00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,920
learnings but if people don't have the

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,720
time to wrap their heads around exactly

00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,880
what you're after do it in little

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,070
bite-sized chunks take your early win

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
explain that to that to them and realize

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,700
that you're playing a chess game with

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,260
many moves and if it takes a few moves

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,860
to get someone over the line that's not

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,740
a problem

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,390
prove value concentrate on small but

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,630
real business value to get the attention

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,830
and just create but awareness excitement

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,450
something you can talk about in the

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,130
corridor next time you see that person

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,020
or that person's manager in a corridor

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,520
you're not going to just say hey how was

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,290
the footy on the weekend you're gonna

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,590
say how about that easy win that I got

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,720
over the line wasn't that neat okay easy

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,790
wins in practice break it down for

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,470
people early goals need to be very

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,420
clearly defined things that aren't

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,000
clearly defined turn out not to be

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,360
achievable or once achieved turn out not

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,640
to be recognized so here's an example of

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,520
an easy win turning on static analysis

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,410
just for the sequel handling code what's

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,750
the problem or opportunity by this easy

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,280
win well people keep picking up user

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,510
input vulnerabilities during final

00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,770
testing that's what the problem is this

00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,610
takes time and money and could be easily

00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,800
avoided

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,780
I personally approach this problem

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,490
differently which is it just bugs me

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,260
aesthetically but that doesn't really

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,160
convince other people very well

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,020
so it's involved install a tool

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,850
configure it just for the exact thing

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,040
you want it to do even if your tool is

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,140
pot you know capable of far more right

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,730
don't try to sell sell people a whole

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,770
you know the whole meal straight away

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,080
just concentrate on those simple things

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,180
add it to the build pipeline never

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,800
forget to actually make an actual list

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,360
of who's involved I don't mean think

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,580
about who's involved and then forget

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,289
about it I mean write down actual piece

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,930
of paper Trello card however you keep

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,520
notes make that list explain to the

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,740
people around you you've thought about

00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,120
all of those different perspectives when

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,850
you thought about the requirements and

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,060
how to solve the problem if possible

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,130
specific value you know have reduced

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,380
rework reduced overall time to deliver

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,240
some people may care about the specific

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,940
value they'll just be pleased that

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,810
you've thought about

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:03,340
concrete outcomes of your work runs on

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,880
the board matter so first of all I love

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,500
cricket

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,480
I haven't watched it for many years but

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,300
I wasted much of my post a university

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,530
career watching cricket secondly this is

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,790
how a lot of people are going to see

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,770
what you do you're out there in the

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,420
middle trying to score more runs tripe

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,180
trying to improve the way you code try

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,350
to improve the way the team codes a lot

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,340
of the people you need to convince

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,260
they're just going to be out on the

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,520
margins just watching the game you know

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,630
they're not going to be too fast what

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,190
kind of bat you've got they're not

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,080
really gonna be too fast on your tactics

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,340
you need to talk to them about the runs

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,270
on the board they're interested in the

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,280
bigger picture so runs on the board

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,840
again breaking out that breaking out

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,030
what this actually means so what's the

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,460
problem or opportunity for getting runs

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,930
on the board people aren't aware of the

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,360
importance of the issues you're trying

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,530
to convince them of it really doesn't

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,210
matter at this point whether you're

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,820
talking to a technical person or a

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,640
non-technical person what matters is

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,100
that they're not aware okay or possibly

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,020
they have other priorities but to start

00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,740
with they're not aware they don't

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,780
understand

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,610
how it's going to contribute value they

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,920
don't seem to prioritize your work and

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,510
they don't support your decisions it

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,520
could be a lack of awareness on your

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,200
part of their priorities but it could

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,420
equally be a lack of awareness on their

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,310
part so really the runs on the board

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,400
start to help them understand that you

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,980
create value by doing what you're doing

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,480
get a few achievable things done explain

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,640
what can be achieved who are benefits

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,100
and how show the importance of the work

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,030
by explaining value so who's involved

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,080
your manager other advocates who care

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,390
also people who involved are the

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,360
detractors who are concerned about the

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,730
cost the effort or the approach so you

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
may not be able to exactly win them win

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,940
them over but they're most certainly

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,920
involved and they'll be out there doing

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,170
things in your organization or in your

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,450
life whether or not you're aware of it

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,480
so include them on the list too so

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,250
what's the specific value you may spend

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,290
less time frustrated at the fact your

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,940
ideas don't get up you might find it a

00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,440
little easier to have conversations with

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,250
the people around you about why you're

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,770
doing what you're doing

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,930
you're more likely to actually achieve

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,970
the the benefits realization from your

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,800
proposal so instead of spending so much

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,390
time arguing for your

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,580
you'll spend a little bit more time

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:19,320
doing the idea less time wasted okay an

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,300
overnight success years in the making so

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,089
building momentum what's the problem or

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,100
opportunity around momentum so suppose

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,630
you've managed to convince someone maybe

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,070
if you're sitting there in a development

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,839
role by yourself you might be able to

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,519
just carve out enough of your time to

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,070
start making some progress and people

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,720
start seeing it if you're trying to get

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,339
a whole team on board perhaps what's

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,899
going on is you've managed to get one

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,420
sprint you know where they've included

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,589
folded a few you know fixing goals into

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,540
their sprint maybe they've done some

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,790
threat modeling maybe they've closed a

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,920
few bugs whatever it is but the problem

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,140
if you don't have momentum is that you

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,269
need to keep re arguing that same case

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,890
you're stuck back on day one saying hey

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,750
can we close them bugs I've still mote

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,880
still making the same arguments as last

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,800
time leads to push back and change

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,970
resistance maybe there was a window

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,310
where they were open to it but their

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,860
priorities have shifted now you've got

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,779
to reap it your ideas you siddell

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,640
somehow not making enough progress so

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,079
what's involved getting people

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,440
accustomed to what you're doing and why

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,520
literally just getting them used to it

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,589
getting people to want to share in your

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,360
success and be a part of it if you're

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,980
starting to get runs on the board with

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,630
your manager with the team with whoever

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,730
it is that's starting to listen to you

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,500
other people are going to start to want

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,360
that thing too they're going to want

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,730
that same recognition you've managed to

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,790
achieve and you should let them have it

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,130
so who's involved your manager

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,779
approvers and supporters detractors once

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,730
again need to understand the negative

00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,370
messaging that's coming back as well so

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,079
the specific value is that other people

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,360
start advocating for your proposal and

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,310
approach other people are in meetings

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,160
going we should do that thing that this

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,630
person wants to wants to do other people

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,670
are starting to solve your problems for

00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,529
you the more momentum you've got and the

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,329
more people buy into what you're doing

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,770
the more people are on your side whether

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:05,230
you know it or not helping you solve

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,089
problems so there's more time spent on

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,890
benefits realization compared to

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,399
advocacy and that advocacy is more

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,779
effective through greater diversity so

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,680
we'll get by with a little help from our

00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:19,600
friends sponsors advocates and allies so

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,459
what's the problem or opportunity you

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,740
can't be in every meeting you won't have

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,560
the authority in every Conte

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,300
and you can't see all the meetings this

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,650
one is really particularly jumped out at

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,730
me when I've been thinking more recently

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,550
about diversity

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,440
I used to very much believe and honestly

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,300
I still do that the best way to solve a

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,370
technical problem is to have one person

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,930
one human mind that loads in all over

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,460
the factors so they can understand all

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,320
the trades and balances and see the

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,180
whole picture and then they're going to

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,920
be able to really effectively come up

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,240
with a solution that understands all the

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,730
trade-offs involved and I still think

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,760
that's incredibly valued valuable and

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,620
undervalued in general but there's going

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,390
to be blind spots with that you're going

00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,010
to need other people to help you and if

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,200
you've spent all of the time coming up

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,940
with your own ideas other people aren't

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,770
necessarily going to be on board either

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,690
and the modern software engineering

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,330
environment is more than more often than

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,060
not a team it's it's much less common

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,070
now to have individual major

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,750
applications built by you know just one

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,700
or two people it's much more common to

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,100
have at least four people probably

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,900
around eight if you include what I call

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,150
the wider immediate team which includes

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,430
project managers customers you know your

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,460
supervisor etc really you've got to be

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,200
thinking about these dynamics so who's

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,260
involved getting a little repetitive now

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,060
but you know it never hurts because

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,010
repetition helps people simply remember

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,840
what you have to say actually just

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,250
helping people remember that you exist

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,230
in what you're trying to achieve is a

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,480
pretty big part of the battle so

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,250
specific values the outcome becomes a

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,320
priority for other people and that's

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,600
really the tipping point is where it's

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,400
not all on you anymore the energy being

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,990
added to the system doesn't have to come

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,060
from you anymore and it starts coming

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,880
from other people it becomes bigger than

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,640
one person's initiative larger pieces of

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,530
work become possible something that

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,050
seemed impossible at the outset in terms

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:11,100
of scale or ambition becomes much more

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,560
achievable ok decisions get made all the

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,950
time your job is to figure out where and

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,260
how so reporting storytelling and

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,780
messaging this is how you connect with

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,460
decision making if you're in the room

00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,960
you can argue for something but if

00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,220
you're not in the room you're going to

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,990
have to have something to carry your

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,490
message for you and that's why you need

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,130
to go down this path whether you like it

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,260
or not some people enjoy this it may

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,690
seem non-technical someone's going to

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,040
have to do it

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,930
a lot of people certainly don't like

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,000
boring things I don't think any

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,530
developers like boring things it's the

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,090
same for your manager so people just

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,580
switch off so you have to have

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,170
compelling storytelling some people need

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,790
things served their way a business

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,290
person might need it expressed in

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,180
business terms outcomes they can

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,520
understand or value from the customer so

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,600
you'll might have to learn something

00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,670
completely foreign to your development

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,130
goals if you've taken the time to really

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,120
understand if there's a key person who

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,620
you need to convince from a

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,500
decision-making perspective you're going

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,090
to have to go this way people might you

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,160
might not be connected with how other

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,110
people are making decisions people might

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,910
just forget what you said

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,790
so you need to understand key reporting

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,260
if you're in a major organization

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,640
understand and obtain examples of

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,310
reporting from others can be quite

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:27,230
powerful and create a narrative that

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,670
people can understand okay so make sure

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,620
you know what outcomes you can attribute

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,670
even directly to your indirectly to your

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,590
efforts this is something where people

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,970
like might potentially stop they don't

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,280
know how to connect what they're doing

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,490
all the way in terms of value in terms

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,370
of what other people have to do so know

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,820
your basic frameworks momentum and buzz

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,610
charts and infographics so this

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,070
presentation so far has not been a great

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,650
example of any of this this presentation

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,040
has been quite dry I've told you what to

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,430
do

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,100
but I haven't really led by example if I

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,590
have time I'll do so later okay

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,930
well I've got time I'll do it now okay

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,850
so I'm gonna switch into storytelling

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,319
mode this was the talk as I originally

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,740
conceived it and you now have my

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,449
original talk our pre rewrite I used to

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,459
be a developer I have actually stopped

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,230
calling myself a developer I loved being

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,670
a developer I would go onto the mountain

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,230
and I would climb that mountain I would

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,569
fix the problem and it was good and it

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,400
was sunny and I loved it and then

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:30,770
somebody showed me information security

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:33,110
and then I felt a little different so I

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,550
thought you know what I'm not I'm not

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,870
going to take that lying down I'm gonna

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,580
think this through I'm gonna figure out

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,060
what we need I'm gonna figure out what

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,480
this solution is we need all of this

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,670
right now always stuffed we need

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,500
automated analysis SAST and DAST and

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,070
formal methods and Autosport and

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,410
penetration

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,910
penetration testing labs and code review

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,520
and two pairs of eyes and knowledge

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,930
transfer and I went and I took this list

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,340
and all of my passion and all of my

00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,900
thoughts and I took it back to the team

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,770
and they just thought I was a crazy

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:07,070
person and then everyone else just went

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,780
I'd seen I'd seen that I had bought in

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,280
right like I'd got there I had my

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,900
commitment I was interested I was

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,700
interested in the problems I wanted to

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,790
solve them but I hadn't taken the time

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,440
to get people on board and that's where

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,420
I started on the journey that ended me

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,790
up here today I said I thought well okay

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,770
who specifically was I trying to

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,330
convince and why didn't they this was

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,820
not an easy process for me this was

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,110
fairly painful I might add expect pain

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,420
right not awful pain but the pain of non

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,690
comprehension the pain of not getting by

00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,490
and the pain of having to give up on

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,790
time spent on technical work or on

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,170
having to have difficult conversations

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,910
or do whatever it is that involves

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,380
relating to you to your fellow man or

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,440
making the time for it in your day so

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,330
expect it to be a challenge but this is

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,100
what you want right you don't want to be

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,930
the person alone in the parking lot you

00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,910
actually need the team if you're really

00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,220
what you care about is the outcome not

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,720
specifically your role in it but care

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,580
more about getting there than you do

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,830
about your role you'll care about the

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,180
team so how do people work it's not like

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,100
that I mean it's a little bit like that

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,350
but it's definitely not only like that

00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,630
it's much more like this we have huge

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,090
numbers of people and they're all varied

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,560
and different and individually distinct

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,120
and valuable and that's what the

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,940
diversity really means to me

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,460
level level naught of diversity is like

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,200
tolerance like I'm willing to ignore the

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,030
fact that you're different okay

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,710
level two is like oh I'm actually

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,340
willing to really treasure the fact

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,830
you're different

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,230
the next level is I'm actually going to

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,600
pay attention to specifically how you're

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,000
different and really understand that and

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,980
learn that about you and then relate to

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,570
you in a way that works and creates a

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,610
constructive relationship between the

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,530
two of us or the group of us and for me

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,350
that's how you how you actually start to

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,910
do this have a people are waving signs

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,040
are they my signs or are you just

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,510
wiggling your signs ten minutes okay

00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,090
though we're wiggling the signs I

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,610
apologize you can cut it out in post all

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,649
right so

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,659
big things are just little things stuck

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,580
together right so I said that before so

00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,679
the people strategy is much more

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,899
important than the technical strategy so

00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,250
it's entirely possible I've lost a

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,899
fraction of the room that was here for

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,700
the technical strategy if I have time

00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,710
for the third version of this talk right

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,720
right at the end I have some technical

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,700
strategy components plus that list I had

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,200
earlier but if you have the people

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,029
strategy particularly if you have

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,710
technical people in your people strategy

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,299
you don't need the technical strategy

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,399
because the people will come up with

00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:32,500
your technical strategy it's a wonderful

00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,620
referential loop and it's very powerful

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,419
so if you have the right people on board

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,860
and enough of them on board and you've

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,169
understood their diversity and what

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,970
makes them tick and all of that you can

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,159
actually let go of that sense of needing

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,960
control over the technical strategy you

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,940
can let go a little bit of that sense of

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,010
needing control over we need this

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,580
specific product immediately because of

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,590
these gaps in how you know to lay misses

00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,289
some of the sequel injections or that

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,179
firewall doesn't do it soif as well as

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,710
that other firewall because you'll

00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:04,330
actually have the right people in the

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,130
team will start to create the problems

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:11,049
know solve the problems okay so you need

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,580
to identify early wins that others can

00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,320
achieve you need to create an

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,519
environment by which those other people

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,380
start to be able to make those

00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,210
achievements they'll learn and solve

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,100
those problems once the momentum is

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,870
there you're all good right once the

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,000
momentum is there in the drive is there

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,309
in the understanding of the need to get

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,870
the objective to a degree you're done

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:30,580
right that's the problem that this talk

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,549
is trying to trying to deal with is how

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,720
do you get the people on board to solve

00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:39,159
these problems okay build awareness

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,230
familiarity and motivation give people

00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,779
actions they can take even if they only

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,059
solve small parts of the problem get

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:48,279
them empowered give people reasons they

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,779
can understand easily even if they don't

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,580
understand the full picture you

00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,720
understand the full picture it's fine

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,399
you think you understand the full

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,399
picture actually you understand what you

00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:58,480
can see of the full picture so accept

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,240
that everybody's going to have a

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,480
knowledge gap accept that changes always

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,269
hard and usually slow okay so we've made

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,159
it to the third presentation so some

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:13,059
examples of specific actionable things

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,440
people can do so simple things right add

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,809
security criteria

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,029
two job advertisements for developers

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:21,039
that's probably reasonably achievable in

00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,690
most organizations you know you're not

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,879
necessarily going to you know require

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,320
everyone to have a really specific

00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:27,519
certification or a specific level but

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,320
what this is going to do is it's going

00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,330
to make your HR department ask for it

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,190
it's going to make a job applicant think

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,870
about it at least once it's going to

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,789
make the hiring manager think about it

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,440
at least once and it's going to be an

00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,529
easy win and you're going to be able to

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,970
talk about it chase up the resolution of

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:46,149
security issues with the development

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,919
teams not everybody does this don't just

00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,250
take and flicked a ticket create a

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,659
ticket yeah go talk to them about it

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,820
send people outside your bubble to a

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:57,309
security conference or event run a

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,259
community of practice don't give anyone

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,539
admin or commit privileges until they've

00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,639
clocked over the wire that's a

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,899
relatively simple thing most technical

00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,190
people should be able to get through a

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,049
few of the over what over the wire

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,870
exercises in a reasonably efficient

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,600
timeframe to be honest purchase some

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,460
products that help people learn I'm not

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,269
big on product endorsements feel free to

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,120
ask me later

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:21,070
but there are lots of options ad badges

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,049
make people feel a sense of reward when

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,179
they achieve these things slack

00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,879
integrations for the same kind of thing

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,919
so there's some specific things what can

00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:32,529
we do as a roomful of people

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,629
let's forget about just what just uh you

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:36,309
know back at home company boundaries are

00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:38,919
as porous and imaginary as firewall

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:42,190
boundaries state boundaries and cultural

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,110
boundaries also just as we as real so we

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,210
could all connect up on LinkedIn we

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,190
could all go for drinks together we

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,840
could all post together on Twitter and

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,639
LinkedIn about things we think are

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,480
important and take advantage of the

00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:56,139
network effect

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,909
I suspect we won't but we could connect

00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,470
to each other's companies and invite

00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:01,509
each other in to come and give

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,970
presentations it's a very well-known

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,860
effect called the halo effect Outsiders

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,240
are seen as being objective

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,149
perhaps having more contemporary

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,769
knowledge and it's a and there's some

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,629
festivity to the occasion there's a

00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:14,889
ceremony there's an invitation there's a

00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,870
meeting there's someone from inside

00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:18,250
everyone has to from outside you need to

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,629
impress people who are coming in

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,330
externally so you all need to pay

00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:24,759
attention or be seen to pay attention so

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,799
we could just do that right like we've

00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,240
all got businesses and email addresses

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,070
we could all just start invite

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,890
each other in four presentations it had

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,720
probably go pretty well email with

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,940
colleagues boss find someone who does

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,679
something good and then recommend that

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,780
there would be a good choice for some

00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,790
further discussion on a topic of your

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,370
choice there's ways of engaging with

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,170
people some of these things may not seem

00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,300
as technical as perhaps some of us are

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,520
useful but they're all very powerful and

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,380
once you start with that people approach

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,750
they'll start to worry about the

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,010
technical approach for themselves then

00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,210
you might have to have a technical

00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,920
discussion with them about what's

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,360
actually right so how do we deal with

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,480
this particular problem

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,309
okay so we've all discussed how do we

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,050
actually really get him get in front of

00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,120
people and deal with people's the fact

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,740
that they're busy right I'm not gonna go

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,450
around worrying about malicious

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,920
motivations here people are incredibly

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,800
busy in their lives they've all got

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,270
entirely legitimate things and they may

00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,929
perceive your problem as a distraction

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,900
there's basically two strategies one

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,670
maybe you have to make some noise if

00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,350
you're not comfortable with that there's

00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,130
the one that I prefer you could be a

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:37,480
weed weeds don't give up weeds grow

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:40,750
everywhere weeds get things done so my

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,460
preference is be a weed okay so here's

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,860
the fourth presentation so how do you

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,330
convince developers okay show them

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,490
things which cannot be unseen that is

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,679
essentially what worked for me talk to

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,420
them about professional responsibilities

00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,700
but noblesse oblige they never really

00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,260
work that well all of the other things I

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,179
mentioned on the people side of things

00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,950
if you need to don't show a way of

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,450
setting up your own parallel security

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,920
testing infrastructure how do you enable

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,390
developers give them time get their

00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,530
managers on board give them skills if

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,240
you haven't noticed I'm running out of

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,710
time help them deal with their obstacles

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,150
how do you convince managers sound like

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,230
you're across absolutely everything get

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,000
to know the names and roles of everyone

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,890
involved know the developers managers

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,330
architects operations team security team

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,980
and all of the members have all of the

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,230
key facts at your disposal and keep them

00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,510
simple talk about reduced costs but

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,040
basically just look like you've thought

00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,410
about this more than anyone's ever

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,960
thought about this before and you are

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,610
across it how do you enable managers

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,620
never leave them an apology mode never

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,540
leave them ignorant never be wrong sweat

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,100
the small stuff don't talk about how

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,860
long it takes or how much effort much

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,480
effort is involved that's a bit like the

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,040
people technical strategy thing it

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,450
sounds ridiculous but actually you

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,830
want them to care before you want them

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,750
to act it's going to be much more

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,310
powerful that way around and then they

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,640
will start solving that problem on their

00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,800
own

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,120
okay conclusions focus on what you can

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,290
do not in what you can't people will

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,390
come up with their own solutions if

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,580
they're motivated enabled big things

00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,320
just little things put together support

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,510
has just teamwork and by him thank you

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:10,350
for my for presentations worth of time

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:14,470
[Applause]

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,060
Thank You Tennessee and we apologize for

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,670
being really bad with the signs telling

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,800
you where time is going which means if

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:24,610
we can run a track any of you can run a

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,200
track as well we do have a couple

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:33,580
minutes for questions so if anyone has

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:37,330
any please let me know I just wasn't

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,650
sure how to interpret the don't be wrong

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,250
with the manager thing on there why

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:44,980
don't you slides back oh you said it yes

00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,720
so you can't always not be wrong I'm not

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,090
actually saying everyone needs to strive

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,890
for literally never being wrong but one

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,660
of the ways in which things get undercut

00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:56,230
is when your key messages are slightly

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,910
wrong so people may not have the context

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,400
of what you have to say and you might

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,380
find your manager repeats a key fact in

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,910
a significant meeting or some other

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,680
context where you're not present so my

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,530
case study for why that's important is

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,090
that context so you're often not going

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,380
to be there when the decisions made and

00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,960
you're relying on someone else's

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,790
presentation of the facts so if you give

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,470
them something that under that someone

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,800
else can undercut you've undercut your

00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,840
position quite significantly so yeah

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,610
many many minor minor inaccuracies but

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,210
don't assume that people will just get

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,950
the point

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,490
make sure your key messaging is

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,490
factually accurate

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,210
could you elaborate on don't leave the

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,160
manager in apology mode are you

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,840
referring to yourself being apologetic

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,480
or are you referring to putting the

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,210
manager in an uncomfortable / apologetic

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,220
position look so first of all in general

00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,530
general in life apology is a very

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,100
powerful thing and I'm all for it what I

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:05,050
really mean is your managers time your

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,370
manager is one of your lead advocates

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:11,370
you want them spending their time on

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,300
arguing your case rather than

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,180
apologizing for something that went

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,860
wrong or a factual inaccuracy so if

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,840
they're an apology mode there I meant

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,940
that in a defensive scenario where

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,460
something has actually gone wrong rather

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,970
than the good version of apologizing

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,530
which should be done so if you either

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,030
don't deliver on something you said

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,510
you'd deliver we're wrong about

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:36,520
something important or anything of that

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:40,330
nature where your manager has to go I'm

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:43,330
sorry for their behavior inaccuracy time

00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,470
spent lack of availability etc you know

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,300
you've got to understand how your

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,740
decisions are going to impact those

00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,480
people around you and some of the

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,090
problems that that could create for your

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,860
manager because they're actually one of

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,340
the more powerful voices you've got even

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,870
if it's a very occasional thing they're

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,130
the ones in this in the more senior

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,720
meetings they're the ones and the other

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,250
forums that you're not going to be and

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,930
they're probably probably reached

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,790
further into more differing parts of the

00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:12,220
organization unfortunately we don't have

00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,720
any more time but I am sure Tennessee

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,520
will come and answer questions for you

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,210
it's generally pretty approachable kind

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,340
of person we will be back in about ten

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,540
minutes with the panel and just so you

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,460
know the panel is not going to be

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,460
recorded so if you do want to see it you

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,890
do have to see it live thanks guys got

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,950
about ten minutes

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,950
