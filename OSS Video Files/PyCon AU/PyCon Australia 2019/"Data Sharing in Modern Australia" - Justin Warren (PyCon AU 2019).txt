thank you for bothering to come and hear

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,040
me talk so my talk today is on data

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,400
sharing in Australia how does help it

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,230
suck less so data sharing is is quite a

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,210
complex beast so we're going to run

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,160
through this in it's a presentation of

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,980
three parts so the first part is how how

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,250
could it be steady sharing how could it

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,470
be

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,010
and what could possibly go wrong and

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,740
then what got what good looks like so

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,939
part one how how could it be it's a

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,470
question I'm sure we all ask ourselves

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,239
every day

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,940
don't sharing is governed by a whole

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,860
bunch of legislation so the legislation

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,340
that you are probably most familiar with

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,170
would be the Privacy Act of 1988 that is

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,370
that covers the Australian privacy

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,230
principles which is something which is

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,300
quite important for us to all be aware

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,050
of it doesn't apply to everybody it

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,149
doesn't apply to very small

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,890
organisations also doesn't apply to

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,079
political parties interesting lis enough

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,789
they have a blanket exemption there's

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,940
also the telecommunications interception

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,949
and Access Act this is the bit that

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,559
allows all the fuzz to wiretap your

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,180
phone as well as all of the data

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,530
retention amendments which passed a

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,299
little while ago which means that

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,010
Telstra can also tap your phone and keep

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,560
all the data for two years and then

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,200
provide access to that to pretty much

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,700
everybody and there's also the access

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,409
and assistance Amendment which was

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,930
passed at the end of last year as people

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,549
are probably aware that means that you

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,229
can actually be compelled to help the

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,430
government to spy on everybody and then

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,189
share the information with as many

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,159
people as you like the Competition and

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,049
Consumer Act of 2010 that applies to

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,460
things like apps that you might write

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,350
that you put on your phone so that

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,729
controls whether or not someone is

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,619
actually getting value for money and

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,009
whether they what you said that it will

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,600
do is what it actually does the

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,890
Copyright Act of course whether or not

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
you're allowed to put that particular

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,180
meme in your presentation and whether or

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,790
not you'll get sued by Disney that would

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,649
possibly get covered by by that act my

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,350
Health Records Act if you're doing

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,110
anything that has to do with booking now

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,759
GP appointments or helping people with

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,070
and anything to do with their medical

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,299
information may get covered by the my

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,520
health records Act if you are

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,819
interacting with that system there are

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,530
also other health-related things the

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,440
consumer data right

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,950
yesterday I had to update my slides this

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,230
morning to deal with this that is coming

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,849
it currently applies to banking so if

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,349
you're one of the new fin tech startup

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,060
companies you're probably extremely

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,459
interested in what's going on with the

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,959
CDR and what the rules are going to be

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,600
when they're actually out that's

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,280
governed by the a Triple C there's the

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,830
data sharing and release legislation

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,959
which is coming sometime soon that's

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,360
still being discussed and that basically

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,819
overrides everything else I've already

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,720
talked about then there's things like

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,040
the census Act archives Act and so on

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,200
there's also the data matching program

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,700
which is Robo debt and center link which

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,170
I've been quite active in and you

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,459
possibly would have seen some stuff

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,970
about that over the last week

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,200
oh that's just federal legislation by

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,769
the way there's there's also state

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,360
legislation a whole bunch of privacy

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,000
various people in different states so

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,090
they all have a different take on things

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,530
that's Australian state legislation

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,140
there's also the rest of the entire

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,880
world so when we have the EU and the GD

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,980
P R which you're probably familiar with

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,829
then California has something similar it

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,180
applies to people who live in California

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,890
not people who live in the EU but it's

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,000
it's actually got some pretty similar

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,070
type things so if you're doing anything

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,109
online you probably want to check that

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,130
out and so on there was stuff about the

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,680
digital licenses that was in the

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,090
presentation just before mine that I

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,950
didn't know about and didn't put in the

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:52,000
list who's read all of those who's read

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:53,850
one of them yeah that's all too hard

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,230
isn't it

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,569
along with everything else to do with

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,130
computers that is awful and broken that

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,970
you're already dealing with in building

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,819
your products that's how hard it is so

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,620
let's not bother because that I mean how

00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,260
can you possibly be expected to read all

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,049
of that and do it all well what could

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,989
possibly go wrong

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,030
this could possibly go wrong

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,849
this lovely example was an app called

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,099
health engine that was in the news they

00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:25,790
were it's it's an app that you can have

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,580
on your phone it also has a website

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,920
so you can book a an appointment to see

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,300
a GP to see a doctor so if you're sick

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,950
and you want to go and see someone to

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,810
get help with that you need to book it

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,690
and a lot of doctors surgeries use this

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,400
system so that they can integrate it

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,200
with their practice management software

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,180
that basically just allows them to say

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,610
right I want to see a doctor there's a

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,560
booking open at 12 o'clock and it comes

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,540
across and goes yes cool we'll see you

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,490
at that time and it sends you a a

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,620
confirmation message to your phone all

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,970
very cool and normal trouble is one of

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,300
the questions that they asked at the

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,340
time was were you injured

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,670
is this an injury and were you injured

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,760
at work and if the answer was yes they

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,290
would share information with lawyers

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,690
personal injury lawyers who like to go

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,900
and sue people for if you got injured at

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,990
work so they were using that as lead-gen

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:26,570
people got kind of grumpy about that who

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:29,750
knew so yeah don't do that

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,460
also health engine they had a lovely

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,990
idea that what they want to do is

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,060
something called practice recognition

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,250
system so on their website they allow

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,630
people who'd seen a doctor they say well

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,340
you've seen the doctor and you've

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,810
experienced their service what did you

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,360
think about it would you like to write a

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:49,220
review so basically TripAdvisor for

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:52,610
doctors why why would you do that but

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,960
anyway they did the fun part was that in

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,950
the review that they put on the website

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,410
in the HTML on the website it showed up

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,910
some of your booking information about

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,560
why you'd seen the doctor so it was

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,940
leaking some quite sensitive personal

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,370
information about the people who have

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,200
done that aside from the fact that they

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,670
were actually selectively editing and

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,700
not putting up the ones that weren't

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,870
very complimentary to doctors so yeah

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:22,610
they don't do that anymore wonder why

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,490
you may recall Medicare Department of

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,970
Human Services wanted to share some data

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,920
ok awesome

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,660
this is a public this is public data

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,670
that's being held on us but by the

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,410
government so it's a public resource we

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,450
should share that so that more people

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,250
can benefit from that so they took a 10%

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,380
sample of the medic

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,090
davison which is every time you see a GP

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,730
and they bill it to the government and

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,030
say what how much was this what did you

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,740
see us for also the pharmaceutical

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,030
Benefits Scheme which is when you go and

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,620
get a prescription filled with your

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,480
pharmacist for a drug that is paid for

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,190
by the government they keep data on that

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,410
so let's share this data people can go

00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,940
into amazing great data things with this

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,780
and they made it anonymous or so they

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,750
thought

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,810
so they'd be anonymized it just not well

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,130
so some smart boffins at the University

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,650
of Melbourne figured out how to reverse

00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,150
engineer it and re identify a whole

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,110
bunch of people in the data set

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,760
including individual people and doctors

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,790
so they pulled all the data offline

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,010
pretty much straight away before a whole

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,780
bunch of people took copies of that data

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,120
there was also legislation that was

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:34,430
mooted immediately after this to make

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:39,260
doing that illegal didn't pass yet so

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,090
that's something else it can go wrong so

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,950
that was that was the result of what

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,169
happened with that it actually got

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,060
pulled and there was an investigation

00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,860
and now there's a whole bunch of people

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,810
who ever quite gun-shy about whether we

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,150
or not we can share that data at all

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,590
should we share that data at all so the

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,479
risk is not just that you'll actually

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,100
expose data from people that you'll then

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,000
cause people do not want to do this

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,700
again in future there was another data

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,140
breach what day is it it's probably

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,419
Tuesday at 11 o'clock we've probably had

00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,050
a three already this morning this one

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,850
was the Red Cross Blood Service who were

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,040
using a service provider as I'm sure

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,990
many of you do in your in your business

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,880
and when you're writing applications you

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,130
don't do everything yourself you get

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,530
help with people that involved taking

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,020
some of the customer data personal data

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,210
about people who were see who would

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,610
donating blood and providing that to a

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,409
service provider in this case what

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,000
happened was that they had a my sequel

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,979
database of backup that they

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,810
accidentally put into a public web

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,810
server directory oops

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,170
that's sort of inadvertent data sharing

00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,970
we probably don't want to be doing that

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,800
another data breach which was again an

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,840
external service provider which was

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,610
providing expense management services to

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,300
a whole bunch of people government and

00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:00,270
private corporations they got hacked

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,940
we had hackers hit a in you and and you

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,040
in this case we're keeping 19 years of

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,860
data on people which all walked out the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,150
door to whoever hacked into them Anu has

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,490
lots of people who deal with government

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,260
because they're based in Canberra can't

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,670
think of anyone who'd be interested in

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,980
people who might end up working for a

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,720
defense agency and would be interested

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,000
in nineteen years of historical data

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,030
about you and what you got up to it uni

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,610
who was a really good person at uni and

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,610
never did anything possibly nefarious I

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,590
[Laughter]

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,340
distinctly remember forgetting that your

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,440
honor it all stems from the Pokemon

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,450
problem gotta catch em all everyone is

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:49,020
keeping way too much data about way too

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:51,570
many things all the time stop it stop

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,880
doing this I keep seeing articles being

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,030
written about data is the new oil how

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,370
it's all this magical valuable stuff

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:03,210
really data is the new oil data is the

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,250
new asbestos stop keeping people's

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,990
personal data it's a liability it will

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,400
get you fine we saw that with Equifax

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,420
although they've run out of money to pay

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,280
people for the fines stop stop

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,870
collecting the data that is the big

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,360
thing so these are all the sorts of

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,800
things that can go wrong right that's

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,750
not very helpful it's fund at Winged

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
about but you actually need to have an

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,050
idea of well what do we do what should

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,710
we do so let's have a look at what good

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,110
looks like it doesn't look like this

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,430
right this is the problem you have when

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,200
you're collecting too much data about

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:40,530
everybody it's just junk so much of the

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,350
data is noise there are billion dollar

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,800
companies whose entire reason to offer

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,200
existing is to help people sort through

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,770
their garbage to find the one piece of

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,529
valuable information that it's

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:59,440
and you keep writing software that is

00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:02,470
creating more noise really do you need

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,470
this data why do you need this data I

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,649
ask yourself this question much more

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,250
often why are we keeping this what is it

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,390
for

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,980
because good design isn't when you've

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,149
continued to add things right

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,010
something's finished not when there's

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:21,399
nothing left to add but when there's

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,800
nothing left to take away simple systems

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,440
are much easier to reason about don't

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,209
add things for no reason don't just make

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,740
it complicated because it's fun and cool

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,390
and yes it is fun and cool to write

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,790
these big complicated systems full of

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,649
kubernetes and you know multiple

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,630
multiple distributed systems that run

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,670
across the entire world right there's

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,770
one company on earth that has problems

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,820
the size of Google and you've probably

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,820
know the name of that company

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,700
also when you're collecting this data

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,440
from people one of its personal ask them

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,570
so much of this data has just slipped up

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,700
by your phone saying well actually no I

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,649
need that data because I want it it's

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,380
like well have you considered asking

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,579
people often if they know what it is and

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,160
they know what it's for and it provides

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,170
benefit to them they'll say yes like if

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,570
I need to use a Maps application in

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,790
order to get me from A to B and find the

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,589
location of the conference I need to

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,540
tell it where I am so that it can show

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,690
me I hang on you've gone left when you

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:27,010
should have gone right no I don't want

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:30,520
to go via Albuquerque that's okay

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,470
what's not okay is I want to show you an

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,480
ad every four and a half seconds over

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,490
the top of the map display it's like

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,290
well that's not useful to me but that's

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,600
what all of these applications keep

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,089
being designed for stop doing that ask

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,680
more put something in there because it

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,940
needs to be there be paranoid we just

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,980
went through a whole bunch of reasons of

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,010
what could possibly go wrong a lot of

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,180
that was because people weren't

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,250
understanding or weren't sufficiently

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,589
diligent about what the computer was

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,800
going to do computers are incredibly

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,740
stupid they are shiny rocks they will do

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,870
exactly what

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,240
tell them to do no more no less so

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,770
someone told the computer to upload a

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,810
whole bunch of personal information to a

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,550
website about their medical conditions

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,620
and all of the time we're not doing it

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,250
on purpose the computer is not your

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,080
friend

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,420
it keeps saying it's your friend it is

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,570
trying to make your life difficult and

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,970
we're all technologists surely you of

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,610
all people know that it is a miracle

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:33,620
that I managed to get that laptop which

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:38,180
runs Linux to display something AV in

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,710
2019 and yet it's it's totally able to

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,200
keep all about my private information

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:47,060
safe and secure really we can't manage

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,430
sound because it's designed by humans

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,840
and this is the problem you need to

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,490
remember that this is being designed by

00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,960
humans humans are fallible we make

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,660
mistakes we're terrible at things and

00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,420
all of the stuff that you're building

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,340
we're not building everything yourself

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,900
it's also connected to the stuff that

00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,420
everyone else in this room is building

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,150
and they're humans who are also terrible

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,850
and make mistakes and mean well but

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,860
screw it up and your stuff depends on

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,070
all of their stuff and if any one

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,890
component of that goes that goes awry

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,420
then the data could leak and instead of

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,110
sharing stuff that you wanted to share

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,370
you might be sharing the wrong things so

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,540
keep it simple don't over complicate

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:35,060
stuff right we don't need to run full

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,380
enterprise agile process or whatever

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:42,230
this is this is not necessary keep it

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,340
simple let's have a look at some good

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,380
examples of people who have actually

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,000
done this well well I like to rag on the

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,430
government a lot as people who know me

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,410
well know because as we heard in the

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,810
last talk that Asghar cannot computer

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,190
they're pretty famous for it neither can

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,520
private enterprise so none of you are

00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,520
off the hook

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,830
but let's have a look at some good

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,900
examples so the Australian Bureau of

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,820
Statistics despite getting some things a

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,510
little bit wrong the data that they

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,370
collect and then share is awesome go and

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,670
spend some time on the ABS website

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,130
looking at stuff it's amazing what you

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,410
can

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,440
and they do a really good job because

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,209
they are extremely careful partly

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,800
because there are some very very strong

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:27,839
laws in place to make them be careful so

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,040
things like if we are going to put out

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,620
data and there's only two or three

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,750
people in that particular cell we won't

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,990
do it because that could expose

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,269
individuals and that we don't want

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,529
anyone to know that those three people

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,029
who happen to be between the ages of

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:45,660
this and this in that particular mesh

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:47,009
block have HIV so they won't do that but

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,569
they will still share aggregate

00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,600
statistics which are incredibly useful

00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,440
in a lot of different circumstances so

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,709
fabulous

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,920
good job ABS data agaves you

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,660
similarly mixed bag but there is a lot

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,730
of really cool stuff that date ago

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,310
Veilleux is trying to do they are

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:07,949
providing datasets to people like us

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,870
that we can then go and mix and reuse

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,899
and do awesome stuff we've build new

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,060
applications on so that's that's worth

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,540
doing again it's underpinned by some

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,610
pretty strong legislation Asli awesome

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,779
organization I am a big fan I spend way

00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,939
too much of my time looking at

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,759
legislation with Asli now you can go and

00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,439
get this as public information from say

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,750
Parliament info we've the federal

00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:33,180
legislature already astir of legislation

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,709
but it's really hard to use its typical

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,680
kind of government interface stuff

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,269
honestly puts an overlay over that makes

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,509
it searchable and linkable and you can

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,380
find who cited what when very cool worth

00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,380
checking out

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:50,100
trove amazing goes and digitizers a

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,769
whole bunch of newspaper articles and

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,470
magazine articles from the last hundred

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,139
years or so fully freely available that

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,720
you can go and search and find there's a

00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,089
guy by the name of Tim Jarrett he does a

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,520
whole bunch of amazing stuff with trove

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,620
so for examples of what you can do with

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,780
data which you then provide and share

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,579
back to people Tim sure it has some

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,370
fabulous idea fabulous things that you

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,189
can do Orin I only became aware of them

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:21,340
this week they similarly they will take

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,290
ABS data and then overlay that as

00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,110
on top of things so this particular map

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,430
shows I think the incidence of cancer in

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:32,260
and around the Sydney basin that's just

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,200
one of the maps you can do again fully

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:38,170
free online and they have an API

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,630
supercool rosie Williams has created a

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,340
site called oz girl info which takes a

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,170
whole bunch of again these open datasets

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,380
overlays stuff over the top of it to

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,450
create new insights so this shows a

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,390
number of contracts that were awarded in

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,990
various years via the information that's

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,700
on Oz tender Oz tender is sort of

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,060
transparent about what government is up

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,770
to but rosie has taken overlays on that

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,510
to provide greater insight to what's

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,370
actually going on such as the number of

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,870
people who get awarded contracts and

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,780
what the value is so who got the most

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,670
number of contracts in any given year

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,430
right now I am big fan of them as well

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,170
this helps you to write Freedom of

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,660
Information requests which you can then

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,920
send to various government agencies or

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,860
anyone who is governed by the Freedom of

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,350
Information Act in order to show for you

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,090
to get information from other people and

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,380
they help to orchestrate that whole

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,180
process so you don't have to remember

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,690
when the stuff should've come and what

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,130
is the next step in the process another

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,110
thing I highly recommend which again was

00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,340
only published this week this is a

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,630
cartoon guide to digital ethics which

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,190
covers a bunch of these data sharing

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,230
issues and what you should consider it's

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,940
a primer it's quite simple

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,800
but it's a really good easy to

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,930
understand beginning to how to deal with

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,070
all of this well worth downloading and

00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,990
there's other people who can help you

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,690
you don't have to do this all by

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,280
yourself you can go and get information

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,260
from the Australian Information

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,850
Commissioner so there is what is the

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,040
legislation that you need to understand

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:13,000
how do you do that how do you do it well

00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:15,940
and safely there are those in New South

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,410

this and would love to help you to

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,990
understand how to access data keep it

secure and to share it with other people

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,910
