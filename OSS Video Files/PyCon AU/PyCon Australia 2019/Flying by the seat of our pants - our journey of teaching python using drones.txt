Title: Flying by the seat of our pants - our journey of teaching python using drones
Publication date: 2019-08-03
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2019
Description: 
	Kylie Mathers

A few years ago we found ourselves teaching students everything from Python to Arduino.  It was our plan to replace all the other languages with Python as we streamlined our course.   Learn why we introduced drones, what we learned not to do and what we were surprised about.

Jack thanks for being here nice and

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,610
promptly we're gonna get started with

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,389
our first talk in this session and I'd

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,410
like to introduce Kylie Mathers and

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:14,610
Kylie's coming up to the front I'll give

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,680
you a little bit of information about

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,240
her so Kylie is worked in as a

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,609
Queensland high school teacher of

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,529
Business and Technology for 29 years and

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,160
this morning she's going to talk to us

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,070
about I guess a little of a bit about

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,590
the the traps and the courts a bit of a

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,989
cautionary tale around using drones in

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,730
the classroom and she's appropriately

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,140
titled her talk flying by the seat of

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,930
our pants so I'm gonna hand over to

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,300
Kylie and one other thing just a bit of

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,649
admin if you do have any concerns or

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,750
questions throughout the conference

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,300
those of us wearing the green lanyards

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,620
are the people to approach so just see

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,059
someone with a green lanyard come and

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,829
have a chat and we'll sort out any

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,910
issues that you have so that's that

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,680
that's the thing to be looking out for

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,980
all right Kylie it's over to you yep

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,809
thanks Bruce and when I first came up

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,699
with the idea that it might be a little

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,040
bit fun to fly to Sydney and talk I

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,659
thought oh look I'm a newbie they don't

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
know me they'll choke me at the end of

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,210
the day you know when everybody's

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,369
reading their emails and there's one or

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,689
two didn't I get it wrong so um yet

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,970
there won't be a whole lot of coding

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,860
talk here there won't be any flying of

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,570
drones here today so if you've come

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,030
expecting to see things in the air

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,560
you're not going to it actually has

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,720
meaning this flowing rather city of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,150
plants it means doing things by instinct

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,979
or feel and most of us do that every day

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,659
as a teacher especially when you're

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,310
teaching code because it's a different

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,750
thing every year the things that used to

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,979
teach the grade 12

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,979
you're now teaching the grade servants

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:51,060
you know and when you think about it

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,530
we come from a Catholic school that it's

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,640
at last year we celebrated 50 years of

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,610
being a Catholic school which is pretty

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,670
old up in Queensland and we were one of

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,840
the first we were the first Queensland

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,700
co-ed school in the Catholic sector so

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,060
you could think to yourself well what on

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,920
earth could make

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,900
cuz think about playing around with

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,069
sharp things you know and who has

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,620
experience with that Shawnee maybe hi

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:24,160
Mick teachers no I have 15 year-olds

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,510
maybe maybe man arts teachers yeah yeah

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,950
they're pretty good with chisels and

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,730
kids and trying to control them from

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,730
slitting other kids but maybe not risk

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,250
adverse technology teachers like me so

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:42,160
it was a bit of a journey a few years

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:44,830
ago Hurston we had a problem we found

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:51,600
that we were expecting too much of our

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:57,069
students we had PHP for server-side

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,260
interactions we had SQL databases and

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,569
then we moved on to Arduino so they

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,030
could do some prototyping and then we

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,400
threw JavaScript at them as well and

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,780
then PI thing came along all that - so

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
this is all within the space of a couple

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,190
of years so because of that we couldn't

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,109
really go very deep into any of the

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,640
learning and we kept starting a new

00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,530
language starting a new language and we

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,620
didn't get very far into it and we

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,829
thought oh gee wouldn't it be good if we

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,870
could have one language all the way

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,890
through a little bit of a challenge

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,560
because at the time that one language

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,940
just didn't do it and wouldn't it be

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,970
really good if it was open source so it

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,920
was always try we hoped and source

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,650
because you know anything could happen

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,790
in a school we might change from Apple

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:52,870
to Windows we might go to BYOD which is

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,359
all exciting we might have our students

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,350
leave our school and we really wanted

00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,329
them to be able to take the knowledge

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,389
with them so it wouldn't be great if we

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:04,420
could all with Python so we had some

00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:06,670
grand ideas so the beginning of last

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,730
year the search began and we looked

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,989
around and we looked around and we

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,470
thought well whatever it is that we

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,930
choose it's got to be able to use and be

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,060
applied with prototyping because there's

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,590
nothing like when the students actually

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,889
get that connection right the light

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,129
lights up or a sense

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,830
I read some movement in the room or a

00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:29,419
servo starts moving little light Bible

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,120
switches on in the kids heads they get

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:36,020
very excited so it had to be applied to

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,060
that we had to be able to use the ev3 as

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,240
if we could we have them in the cupboard

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,740
and the you know at one stage I was

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,840
thinking I might have to give them at a

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,550
primary school because all you could use

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,909
them for was with block coding at the

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,529
time so and the students were really

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:55,219
engaged whenever we got them out of the

00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:58,039
box and of course the poster boys in the

00:04:55,219 --> 00:05:00,529
moment they were gaining popularity the

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,009
old drones we had a bunch in the

00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:04,370
cupboard

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,560
again block coding so wouldn't be good

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:11,539
if the one program one open-source could

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:15,080
do all of those things so at the I think

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:18,409
was 2017 towards the ED there was a

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,409
world of drones Congress in Brisbane the

00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:22,339
lady em to the left is dr.

00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:27,370
what's-her-name Katherine Bell

00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:30,050
I think Thank You Katherine ball and

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,300
just like any old good woman if she

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,370
can't find something that she needs she

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,599
creates it so she looked around for

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,649
something that would bring together

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,930
things such as developers applications

00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:44,689
commercial researchers all together one

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,000
one place couldn't find it so she

00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:50,000
created its in its third year this year

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,800
so she was really good with setting up

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,430
all of the industry there very

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,379
interesting they even had an army

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,779
representative about all their little

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,430
drones and some you know even the little

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,279
commando drones they strapped to their

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,419
belt they're like little helicopters

00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,860
throw them over the wall before they

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,180
send the commandos to see what's

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,879
happening before the guys get killed

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,229
it's always a good thing

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:17,199
and at the drone Congress the Queensland

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:20,240
Government announced their own strategy

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,939
so this picked up just a little bit more

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,569
to know that a government was going to

00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:30,110
say look at research and development

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:33,680
commercial investment and create things

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,610
such as drone pathways for commercial

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,490
applications

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,530
and I thought oh well this might be

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,909
something we can play with we took

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,129
ourselves off to a couple of PD's you

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,659
know when we call it work other people

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,330
who saw our photos probably didn't

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:52,879
padrona on the left was about $15,000

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,439
won and it felt like you were going to

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,240
be chopped up immediately if you went

00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,300
anywhere near it it was a big sucker

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,370
MJ rats there's a guy on the side he's a

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,490
teacher up our way and he's a he's a

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,490
really good share of information so in

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,729
those days he let us know how he managed

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,069
not to get any kids chopped up during

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:13,639
their first year of operation cool thank

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,710
you

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,849
and but they were just using blockly

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:23,349
code just to get their jr. started in

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:26,240
the cupboard we still had our drones

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:28,430
let's see what we can do have a look

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,650
what's out there so we had a little work

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,300
out there tinker is what the other

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,879
schools were using to run their drones

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,990
so tink is a drag and drop and if we

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,490
were going to meet the Australian

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,830
Curriculum there's no way in a high

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,000
school you could get away with that

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,129
unless you're doing something like stem

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,259
where you could get them going very

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,020
quickly but you wouldn't meet the

00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,539
criteria you need so we thought oh well

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,210
hada got that that was cool but let's

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,819
move on it's very baby is great for

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,389
primary school by the way

00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:01,909
Apple had a swift and playgrounds

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:05,509
development area where you could link up

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,430
to the the memo drones but again what

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,259
happens if we no longer had Apple Macs

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,389
like we're in it for the long term not

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:14,150
in just for this year so it was

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,849
something to think about but we'd need

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,300
iPads for this one we didn't have iPads

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:22,430
as another investment okay and then

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,849
there's these nasty looking suckers

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:29,449
called Co drones they do blockly or they

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:32,449
do an Arduino type coding again it would

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,789
mean buying another bunch of drones and

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:36,409
already got a couple in the cupboard you

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,000
know I've got plenty of students willing

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,909
to take them off my hands but I'd rather

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,149
not spend another you know 10,000 or so

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,990
to get started luckily for us the year

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,540
that we started looking dr. Amy was all

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,700
so multitasking and getting something

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,430
done and she created the pie parrot

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,529
library so the pie parrot library at the

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,890
beginning of last year wasn't terribly

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:04,190
well documented in all of the platforms

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,380
so the Mac wasn't so terribly well done

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,180
it had a little bit but it was very much

00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:12,589
well documented in the other bits and it

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,120
has since gained momentum Amy on the

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,279
other hand over there she looks really

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,720
young doesn't she young and gorgeous for

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,130
a doctor I think that's the difference

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,330
between teaching students and teaching

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,800
lecturing do you think I don't know at

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:29,270
the same time she was doing the PI

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,420
parent library she was working with AI

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,000
and machine learning of severe tornadoes

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,040
hail storm predicting all at the same

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,649
time so I call that a little bit of

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,350
overachieving don't know what you call

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,110
that and it looked like from the PI

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,810
parent library when we read the docs

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,360
that if we bought these little Lego

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,579
attachments on the top plug them in on

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,500
top of our little drone it would allow

00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,910
our Apple Macs you don't need it if

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,450
you're running Raspberry Pi or anything

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,820
else to talk to our drone so we can use

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,380
the suckers in the cupboard just buy

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,670
these little attachments we might be

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:11,839
able to get going so the only problem

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:14,470
with that is that you had to go through

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,610
all of the technical stuff because I

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,490
never came through that sort of

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:23,029
technical stuff when I went through uni

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:26,240
so one of our number has the technical

00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,589
ability Thank You Daniel and he took a

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,940
little bit of time to see if it was

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,279
possible for the max because the

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,010
documentation wasn't full but I mean

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,550
working with terminal I don't know about

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,740
you but terminal for me with max brings

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,660
back memories of this you know that

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,760
schmuck a little arrow it just sits

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,910
there looking at you and I need those

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,920
no can get anything to happen and even

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,560
if it gets to happen and never tells you

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,360
it's happening it's a secret like it

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,930
doesn't give you feedback it doesn't say

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,550
type there it's not a nice thing so you

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,170
know I thought brought flashbacks of

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,180
swapping in the five and a quarter inch

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,200
floppy and waiting three minutes

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,670
flopping it in the other one and

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,170
suddenly you've got this little green

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,210
arrow and you're going oh that was great

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,610
I think I've achieved something wouldn't

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,410
know anyway it looked like we could do

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,650
something it looked like Piper it was a

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,570
thing for us let's give it a go

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,640
experimental and this is where the

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,760
flying by a set of our parents we needed

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,680
some test bunnies for this one well I

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,480
think we found them in our grade ten

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,930
kids it was turned for what could go

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,210
wrong they were keen a little bit too

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,390
keen you know why don't be frightened me

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,700
it'll be right we could race them yes

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,980
that's where my heart level went up and

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,060
down a little bit gone I don't know I

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,890
don't know about the racing business so

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm thinking well how are we gonna

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:52,460
approach this sketched out as you to

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,560
really quickly an idea of what you think

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,360
might be the approach and you might look

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,510
at it again at the end ago not going

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,770
that way again so it won't just slow

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,050
them down a little bit I thought I

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,150
should start with what is a drone that

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,530
sort of thing and then bore them a

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,410
little bit more with safety and

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,780
legislation just calm it down for a few

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:16,880
weeks before we get into the chopping

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:19,250
people up business so we started with

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,950
getting to know the drone so in German

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,960
we found out it means to roar yeah

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,030
that's really funny guys and then

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,820
Swedish it means to drow so the kids

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,610
it's hilarious yeah but today you know

00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,040
it could mean anything from sound to a

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,410
male bee and the kids go ah does sound

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,040
like a bee yeah yeah yeah whatever

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,080
so still in the in the way of trying to

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,640
calm them down types of drones hey guys

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,220
do you realize they're not just flying

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,380
things we've got drones on the Great

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,050
Barrier Reef sticking it into the

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,940
crown-of-thorns starfish we've got those

00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,280
little stupid things we've got BOTS

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,480
plenty of bots and then we've got the

00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,790
flying things

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,120
and think I gotta find things we like

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,769
those let's get into it no no you're

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,050
gonna have to do some research first

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,750
encounter so I made them pick one of

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,430
these topics is there all these like

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,620
applications of drones that are out

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,810
there you beaut fantastic and each of

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,300
them had to pick one and then report

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,160
back to the class in talk to us you know

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,480
the old talking business they didn't

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,730
want to do that the beginning that was

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,350
just an informal talk ething because in

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,620
our assessment I seen you you've got a

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,139
talk and they had to tell us whether it

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,170
was you know is it a real thing is it a

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,000
marketing ploy and what do you think is

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,519
there any issues that you can see there

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,350
so they were quite interesting some of

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,510
the things they came back with the lady

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,610
gaga and the Intel drones for example

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,860
and the Winter Olympics were hilarious

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,300
so we came up with a whole bunch of

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,670
lists so that were there any problems

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,440
with drones ah yeah so they became those

00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,079
critical thinkers yes it's annoying

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,670
there's a few privacy issues large

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,649
numbers of drones if you live on the

00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,089
Gold Coast don't know but you every man

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,180
who's dog wants to film themselves

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,579
surfing and you're under a you know an

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,990
airport place too so you can't really

00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,779
fly them but they do anyway

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,459
larger droids can handle that the larger

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,130
weights but that's a bit of an issue as

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,110
well and then we spoke about well who is

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,589
responsible when those suckers crash on

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,940
your head and a little bit of safety as

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm trying to impress on them that

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,100
they're not all fun and games

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,250
safety equipment mother and me couldn't

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,380
let that one go past so I you know got

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,290
onto eBay and such and bought a couple

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,600
of these they were expensive I don't

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,990
know I can see why people steal them now

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,110
from the council worker they're about

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,990
$120 each so they were too used in order

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,300
to rope off the areas so that we could

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,730
allocate where the pilot would stand and

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,410
where everybody else wouldn't they got

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,779
confused about those two issues every

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,540
now and again we introduced the hive is

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,010
best for the pilots so that helped a

00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,690
little bit about working out who should

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,279
be flying this drone or who's coding

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,230
this drone at this moment you could

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,930
should be able to see that person quite

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,220
quickly and then we found these things

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,720
my husband and I ran through this

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,509
PowerPoint with them because I

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,939
that lipo's no it's not liposuction no

00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,990
you shut yeah battery in there to stop

00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:17,209
it from blowing up

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,699
so these minimize the tendency of

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:22,009
batteries which they do they do tend to

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,600
set fire to themselves every now and

00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,069
again so you and you charge you don't

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,560
leave them overnight it's not good for

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,060
the school unless unless you've left

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,000
some expensive things that you'd like to

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,829
be replaced so with the lipo safe bag I

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,889
found that two bags worked really well

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:39,019
yes they're $35 each but one for the

00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,360
spent batteries and one for you newbies

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,220
or fully charged so that you could keep

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,500
control because when you got 15 30

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,000
batteries you tend to forget which is

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,069
which and of course safety goggles the

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,129
height of fashion for all those little

00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:56,990
soft eyeballs and if you've ever had a

00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:58,129
drone in the same room as you with 15

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,019
year old boys you know that your

00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:04,370
eyeballs suddenly become very precious

00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:06,019
and we also had these little safety

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,389
signs that we put at the front of each

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,009
doorway entering the zone just to stop

00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,720
people because they start looking at the

00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:13,430
drone or they start looking at the fun

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,740
you're having all the yelling or that a

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,660
DAC they get into strike by that and

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,370
they walk straight in so if you've got

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,769
this in the way you're going come on

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,930
right back out because you don't need

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,819
some extra curiosity walking around your

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,509
room you've got too much fun going on in

00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:31,730
there already okay so I'm going right

00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,309
we're getting close guys we're going to

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,350
be flying soon eesh not really so let's

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,360
start thinking about how serious this is

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,120
so I found a really good calculator

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,550
splat calculator it's a good one and I

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,350
said well you know how big is this drone

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,850
that with the one that we fly outside is

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,040
1.4 kilos and I said so if that fell on

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,800
someone's head from 30 meters 30 meters

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,139
isn't very high I said how much would it

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,759
you know weigh when it hits them and I

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:02,120
think I worked out it would hit them at

00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:05,929
87 kilometers an hour and I said would

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,150
that hurt oh okay good well I said well

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,250
what about we go 50 we can go up to 120

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,280
meters here the Gold Coast where we are

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,030
I said let's just go 50 how much would

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,980
that be

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,709
if it hits somebody and what turned out

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,419
it was something like you know you're

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,370
always getting pulled up maybe 118

00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:25,579
kilometers an hour so that

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,880
for us is like being hit on on the m1 by

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:32,690
a car with knives on it and because ah

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,240
Oh that would hurt yes it would guys so

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,070
all of the flying business that happens

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,860
on the Gold Coast around the beaches and

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,900
stuff with people doing they're doing

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,660
their surfing videos and such because

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,530
they're so cool that has potential to

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:51,590
damage quite badly so because I like to

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,000
push home the point with the boys we did

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,500
a bit of fruit ninja have you seen this

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,360
one don't give you a few minute you've

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,740
seen it you know see a lot of nodding it

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,020
cuts up a lot of fruit would you like to

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,720
see if you mean us yeah I was see if we

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:10,520
do just tell me when you get bored so it

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:12,500
starts with what do I have sound yeah so

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,210
it starts with grapes you got that's all

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,890
right isn't there just soft and the kids

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:22,400
usually come up with this but then it

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:24,770
moves on later on to to to tomatoes yeah

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,970
a bit like an eye but no eyeballs are

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:32,179
much much more sturdy than than tomatoes

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:36,020
okay so goes through all the food all

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:37,840
the food groups are here represented and

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,420
again

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,100
and again my husband you know he showed

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,490
concern with this one he said well if

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,860
he's gonna clean up the drone so like I

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,230
don't I don't think that's the idea of

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,670
it so yeah he got a little bit concerned

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,880
and then the kids go oh well that's not

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,930
a finger human bodies are so much more

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,590
harder than a piece of fruit

00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:02,020
there's your eyeballs yeah and then I

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,490
think further on it gets pretty exciting

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,650
and it goes through

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,450
oh yeah it's doing a bit of a cucumber

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:12,760
job their sausages are carrots yeah I

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,050
see what carrots are pretty hot it looks

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,040
like a finger to me oh you okay

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,980
eyeball I said there's another eyeball

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,490
going so you know keep your glasses on

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,470
kids it goes on like that so it goes on

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,240
and then and then - my husband's delight

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,690
the thing takes off at the end which is

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,650
really exciting for him is it all right

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,650
with everyone if we're unable

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,919
more sausages there ah ah husband was so

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,940
happy so I didn't stop it from working

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:49,429
no yeah that's exciting

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,799
oh I thought I'd moved on in life the

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,289
video didn't there we go

00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:58,580
a pilot friend of mine I'm gonna stop

00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:59,659
that sent me this one because he does

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,210
time with cadets

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:05,149
Air Force cadets or Air Cadets we call

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,309
them and he showed concern that you know

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:10,669
these drones are really quite exciting

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,899
but you know he's a pilot for Qantas and

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:16,539
he's a bit concerned about it

00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:16,539
so he sent me this one and I think it's

00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:29,119
yeah I think it's 140 I wanted this

00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:32,320
guy's really interesting not one minute

00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,859
forty sorry I'm just gonna go to there

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,389
the drone did not shatter apart it

00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:43,129
completely penetrated it was buried

00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:45,320
inside the wing so the difference

00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:48,470
between what a drone does when it

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,499
impacts the wing of a small plane is it

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:54,970
actually goes into it and starts killing

00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:58,039
all of the construction within the wing

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:01,460
so that's a problem for a pilot

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:05,570
whereas bird it's okay they don't use a

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,710
real one oh sorry I thought I was

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:14,869
talking to the students you get upset

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:16,399
with Gracie stuff you obviously can you

00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,220
see how that doesn't actually go into

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:21,230
the wing so that's the difference is

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,200
that they used like a silicon package to

00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,330
represent a bird strike and the bird

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,669
tends to wrap itself around the wing it

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,739
doesn't go inside and continue wrecking

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,350
it so the plane can still land fine with

00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:36,350
a dent so you know for him it was a

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,570
really big concern if if I kept coming

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,890
along and talking to him about drones

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:44,190
and ears oh but did you realize yeah

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,990
dangerous foe anyway so again still on

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,910
the safety bit we go into the castle

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,030
website we start looking at legislation

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,760
Oh serious kids serious as laws here

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,760
there's laws yes and of course you know

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,320
dry and foul videos have you gone Bruce

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,070
I've got time for a drone two-minute

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,370
drone fell video okay what does that

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,570
mean how many minutes yeah okay that's

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,610
good it's good

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,610
I like this amazing

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,490
[Music]

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:23,360
it's as lovely as not

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:26,750
[Music]

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,270
about now this guy's drone battery he's

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,570
going automatically land I'm dying my

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:37,240
battery's dying and you can see the guy

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,240
on the far side suddenly realizes

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,960
and it says now I think I'm going to

00:22:48,930 --> 00:23:00,720
land now into the water

00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:05,610
there's no $3,000 worth of toy so he

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,150
begins his Olympic run as it goes into

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:11,469
emergency landing mode in the ocean

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,469
[Music]

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,500
this is an absolute class can you see

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:29,630
you okay absolutely gorgeous

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:32,420
yeah and of course it's a guy if it's a

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:37,840
girl okay stop doing that but the guys

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:40,850
on my toy carry guys down you're right

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,080
there we go

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,680
so this thing's still got the blades

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,240
going full blades go on fruit ninja star

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,140
watch the way you're coming around his

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,220
neck yes yes but I've got bad road it's

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,220
really important

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,950
I'm so happy I saved my drone and I'm

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,259
sure everybody else around him is going

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,519
what an idiot so it came close to the

00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:10,159
time when we're saying all this

00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:13,549
legislation their stupidity you're in

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,460
the moment at the time there was the can

00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,289
I fly there at which you know encouraged

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,349
the students before they took off to

00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:23,509
work out anything else around so you can

00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:25,669
see here in the blue position is where

00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,339
we are on that map for instance when we

00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:31,190
started up this app and you can see that

00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,479
there's a fire burning off of you know

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,279
when to burn off happening on the left

00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:38,059
and you see all those circles are all

00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:41,389
had a helipad signs so in that position

00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:44,649
once it does you says look you can't

00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:47,029
take off here you're within a hospital

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,669
helicopter area if you are flying at the

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:52,009
moment please land and see most in the

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:55,190
Gold Coast we can't even have the drones

00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,899
with the what's it called the little

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:01,609
nipper program or something like livery

00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:03,919
pup patrolling the beach because we're

00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:06,739
within the landing zone for that for the

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,190
airport so we can't have that and yet

00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:12,950
they're all up in the air then I threw a

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,839
comprehension test at them I made one up

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,639
but you know obviously Cass I thought it

00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,519
was really good cuz they've now got one

00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:23,029
in their drone fly site mine was better

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,289
obviously and just to check that they

00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:25,969
knew what they were doing because quite

00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,070
a lot of time the kids are just not and

00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:29,179
then it was really important that

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,710
anything about the principles of flight

00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,929
or maybe the principles that I think

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,570
flying involves okay because there is a

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:38,599
little bit of you know dick staying up

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,580
their business and then with the coding

00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:43,070
to come I could see that they needed to

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,749
know the movements a plane mace because

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,269
some of that coding involves knowing

00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:50,659
what your is what pitches what role is

00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:53,080
and of course then we came down to

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:53,080
safety

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,080
so we needed to find a safe place to fly

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,910
so I'm looking around the school and it

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,740
needed to be somewhere indoors cuz those

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,050
little bow bow drones they tend to blow

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,520
away a little bit with the wind and I

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,990
thought well it's got to be inside

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,140
someone with a bit of a soft landing

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,030
because damage is something I do I'm

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,520
challenged with damage you know a

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,770
propeller here and a motor not fitting

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,370
properly anymore there I get you know I

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,570
end up giving up so it had to be that it

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,700
had to be somewhere that could be roped

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,700
off a little bit but had enough of a

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,860
high ceiling life for us the library

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,390
looked like a possibility and the

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,370
librarian made the mistake of thinking

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:37,840
that might be fun yeah so we booked in

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,480
so the first thing that needed to happen

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,700
was that those students in grade 10 had

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,920
to engage with the terminal and that's

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,260
okay because I was there on the journey

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,460
with them about the scary little arrow

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:54,040
so they had to install I think it was

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,590
the untangle zeroconf or according to

00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,290
the docs in PI parent cloned their PI

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:02,220
parent from github and installed Piper

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:05,410
and and obviously the latest version of

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,870
Python and maybe an IDE now this is the

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:10,540
first time that they interacted with an

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,030
IDE because before that they were always

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,490
grokking so always within that safe

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,790
environment so this was a real challenge

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,950
for them and they didn't like having to

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:24,100
be so technical some of them and some of

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,590
them did so the first exercise we got

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,120
them to do was hello anyone home and it

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,190
was about working out if there was a

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,170
connection with the drone from the

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,360
computer to the drone soon PI parent

00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,790
they had some sample code a pseudo code

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,700
it at first flowchart at first explained

00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,610
it then got them to copy and paste and

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,900
the idea was if they had installed those

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,540
libraries properly they would get a

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,250
connection success and there was some

00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,500
excitement in the room then there were

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,380
some very quiet kids I found them later

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,690
though because when it came to this it

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,970
was time to take off and land they

00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,920
couldn't take off and land until they

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,809
had installed those libraries and gotten

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,190
that

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,169
and they're going but I should just be

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,669
able to copy John's and it's not working

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,279
yes because you didn't do what I tell

00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,950
you to do lessons ago so each time we

00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,720
pseudo coded then they worked on their

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,760
previous code and added an extra bit of

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,440
code or adjust to their previous code in

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,700
order it so they're the ones who were

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,409
listening the ones who were following

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,630
instructions had a high level of success

00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,539
you can see what the Pye parrot on the

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,210
right they had two different types of

00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:29,850
takeoff and landing instructions we

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,309
encourage them to use the safe takeoff

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,360
and safe landing it's really good when

00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,610
you get those

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,429
I don't know Mavericks I guess I call

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,830
them in the classroom they they our

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:44,340
testing is not a thing that they like to

00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,269
do they just that eternal loop you know

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,980
up it goes

00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:49,950
and the drone will stay and it will

00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,360
never come down so we enter a channel

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,519
like that one's good because all you do

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,159
is flip the sucker over and it turns off

00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,350
in the safe mode that was good then we

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:04,639
did some CrossFit I called it iterations

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:07,049
up down up down so a looping and then

00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:09,720
what they did is go into the function

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:12,299
modes so making a function of the app

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,610
making a function of the down and that

00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,860
really made it real for them in the end

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,659
because we've done functions in grok but

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,850
until they can actually see it doing

00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,549
what it asked it in the function are

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,919
huge for them so this one is when it

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:29,760
came through for them we did some square

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:34,760
dancing which is a vertical square we

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,809
did pitching yawning flipping out and

00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,789
going around a circle that was pretty

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,710
challenging and then we had the

00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:44,039
assignment so the assignment was a

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,899
promotional video or a or a design for

00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,090
disaster seemed easy to find in our

00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:51,480
classroom

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:53,970
yeah this is one of the products that

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,220
the kids who chose to do the promotional

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,870
video not coding so they had to working

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,940
for it's one coded wonderful promotion

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,940
[Music]

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:10,130
and some of them tried to use the

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,130
library bookcases for mountain

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:16,090
[Music]

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,880
malfunctioning dryer

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,299
I might just flip past there so on

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,070
reflection the physical application of

00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:25,900
the drone was really motivating for the

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,880
students they could immediately see what

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,260
was happening those around them could

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,080
see what wasn't happening and they

00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,120
stepped in to help and give advice

00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,860
because it was obvious whereas it wasn't

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,650
just on somebody's computer they could

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,360
see what it was unfortunately for me it

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,360
was this physical application that was

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,909
really challenging for me managing the

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,490
workflow of 20-something students a

00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:50,470
couple of drones you know the movement

00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,059
around the room the kids who needed help

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,340
the kids who were ready to fly the

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:56,890
batteries that whole thing was really

00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,659
challenging it was so highly visible

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:03,010
that that peer tutoring was impressive I

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,100
reckon the safety considerations could

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,289
be improved next year for me but the

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,299
engagement was really good so I found

00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:12,820
them at my door of my office ready to

00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,830
take all the gear each time you guys

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,780
have weird really are you ready to start

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,590
like the bell and he just went what do

00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:22,750
we do I know he's setting up great can't

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,820
wait for that to finish so what worked

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,520
and what didn't working with only three

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,590
drones at once was a plus I found any

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,230
more the Bluetooth connections went a

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,750
bit weird keeping us space ready to swap

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:38,770
in our spares drone to swap in was a

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,630
good thing labeling each drone with

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,340
their identify a number help to find it

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,990
because some kids just wouldn't stop

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,669
that connection they took it away with

00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,679
them for the next half hour I'm gonna

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:49,630
disconnect and you know come on who's

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,570
got drone one one four six two three

00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,850
come on who's got it you haven't let go

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:58,179
so the next kick occurred ago the lipo

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,890
bag is fantastic the hive is definitely

00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,750
so you could get the invaders out of the

00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,909
plane get out you know the fly get out

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,299
that sort of thing controlling the

00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:10,480
workflow is very difficult we have a

00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,370
mapping mat you just throw it out and

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,500
it's got a satellite picture of wherever

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,780
you like so we found that from sheer

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,429
maps and it helps if you want to do some

00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,200
sort of mapping and grid work sort of

00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:22,500
exercises if you want them to find the

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,370
shopping center and drop off a package

00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,230
containing the flying would be good

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,320
that's one of the things I'd improve her

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,600
by one of the little flying cages and I

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,929
found that the non-authentic batteries

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,440
the ones at the top they they were great

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:41,330
they were less than half the price but

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:47,600
but the Bluetooth connection wasn't as

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:50,059
much so I'm gonna flip through and boys

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,029
do work differently to the girls just so

00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:56,889
you know completely differently so

00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:58,190
that's our reflections so any questions

00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:05,389
great

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:08,000
no I like no questions lovely thank you

00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:10,070
Thank You Kylie for sharing what you got

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,269
up to and sharing those words of wisdom

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:17,049
among oh and a couple of extra bits and

00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:17,049
