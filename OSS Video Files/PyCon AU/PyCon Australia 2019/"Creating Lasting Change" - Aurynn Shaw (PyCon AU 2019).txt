	00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,990
we have our first invited speaker of

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,940
this conference we have orange sha orang

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,880
is no stranger to PyCon Australia having

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,429
already presented twice at our event she

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,710
is the founder of Yara and is a DevOps

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:22,619
culturalist so DevOps what is DevOps in

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,750
15 words or less DevOps is the

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,869
intersection of building software and

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,460
making it work for people I invited Oren

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,250
here because after her groundbreaking

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,500
article in which she termed the coined

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,300
the term contempt culture she spent the

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,160
last 4 years further refining the

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,079
concept specifically around the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,950
intersection of sociology and tech

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,719
culture and with that please join me in

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,719
welcoming orange Shah

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,800
thank you very much Katie another round

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,489
of applause for you all getting to be

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
here today and the wonderful Katie for

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,090
organizing this wonderful conference

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,229
hi I'm Orrin and it really is an honor

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,810
to speak here in front of all of you

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,450
today if you want to live tweet this you

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,070
can find me at at Orrin on the third the

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,909
third longest-running Internet argument

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,890
also known as Twitter if you're curious

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,069
the first two are using it and IRC

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,810
respectively you may have previously

00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,380
heard me speak on tech culture and how

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,659
our culture frames everything that we do

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,369
as Katie mentioned I am founder and

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,710
principal culturalist at I are limited

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,350
we're based out of Wellington and from

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,030
DevOps we naturally do DevOps

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,539
well that's Wellington New Zealand I

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,740
hear there's a Wellington nearby Sydney

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,440
what this means is that we work on

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,360
ensuring the success of technological

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,240
changes by focusing on the cultural and

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,469
organizational impact of those changes

00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,810
and today I want to talk to you about

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:04,469
well what do i do i do devops so i want

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,020
to talk to you about DevOps or how to

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,829
put stuff into prod and how did not have

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,260
it catch fire or really unless it's

00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:16,590
supposed to catch fire in which case you

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,260
know cool now it catches fire and this

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,190
is an easy and non-confrontational topic

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,940
right it'd be really easy to approach

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,320
this as a technical talk to talk about

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,810
deployment engineering because that's

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,510
really cool to talk about migrating to

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,180
micro services to talk about containers

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,859
in your stack and docker and rocket and

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,140
I hear there's something new as well

00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:43,079
which I haven't heard about beyond it

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,060
there's something new as well I could

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,040
talk about theory and my personal layer

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,200
theory of DevOps and deployment and how

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,319
it impacts how we design production

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,150
systems I could talk to you about global

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,090
transactions and how to think about what

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,739
micro services imply for distributed

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,250
transactions what a transaction even

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,620
means what data integrity even means in

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,940
a micro service environment and these

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,220
are all really important architectural

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:15,970
and technical questions really important

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:21,390
when it comes to DevOps but well these

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:24,340
are all technical conversations and well

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,170
who's had that thing where they thought

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,170
that a new technology was was the bee's

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,470
knees and where would Lake the world on

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,330
fire and you were really excited and

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,910
you've fought and fought and there was

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,040
no traction you just couldn't get this

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,220
new technology that you knew you knew

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
would solve so many problems into where

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:50,530
you worked

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:52,750
don't look at my feet I can see and I've

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,400
definitely run into this I've tried to

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,010
get postcards into production at various

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
places I've worked and I fell or some

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,990
stack which I am a huge fan of in the

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,700
production where I've worked and failed

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:11,680
I've tried to get darker into production

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:15,060
and failed or even the cloud you can all

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,060
whoo with me

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,060
AWS Azure Google anything I have

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,270
struggled to get that very first step to

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,900
happen and I bet all of you have very

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,280
similar stories and I've rationalized

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,960
this and I mentioned we've all

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,090
rationalized this in a variety of ways

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,630
we talked about how people just won't

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,570
listen we use negative epithets to

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,730
describe others hostile and dismissive

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,810
language to respond to those people who

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,750
just don't agree with us we treat users

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,750
like this we treat our peers like this

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,380
our managers everyone else that we work

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,150
with and this isn't a blaming session

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,400
like I'm not blaming you or myself for

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,310
any of this but I'm trying to represent

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,240
that this is cultural it's what we have

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:13,090
been taught to do and so it is what we

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:16,360
do do we what we feel the thing that

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,310
drives this is frustration I get

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,110
frustrated at this I get irritated I get

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,850
angry about how this

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:27,060
thing this thing that I know will work

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,060
and will help it's just being ignored

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,650
but as I mentioned I run I ARA and as a

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,290
consultant I get to see a lot of

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,540
companies in action and I get to see a

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,940
lot of how internal cultures have formed

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,130
and how they operate and so today

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,930
instead of talking to you about some

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,180
amazing cool technological work that we

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,910
do talk to you about docker or the cloud

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,940
or salt ii or any of these things I'd

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,710
like to talk to you about change about

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,320
how I've learned to reason about change

00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,610
and how I think we can create lasting

00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,860
change in your organization's but before

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,400
I start I'd like to set some context

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,470
here as Katie mentioned I have this

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,690
theory called devil or called contempt

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,970
culture and all of my thoughts and ideas

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,160
are grounded in this cultural concept of

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,410
contempt culture and this is the process

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,780
by which tech culture encourages us

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,760
teaches us to use contemptuous behavior

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,210
as our means of expressing and

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:30,310
generating social capital my experiences

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,690
as a developer and as speaking to words

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,940
are hard first thing in the morning just

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,100
so you know my experiences as a

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,110
developer and working with and speaking

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,310
to businesses exist within this

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,980
framework within this theory and so with

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,610
that in mind this morning I would

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,650
actually like to talk to you about some

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:55,180
things I've learned by talking to your

00:06:50,650 --> 00:07:00,310
boss or why change is hard and what we

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,290
can do about it contempt culture is our

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,350
communications culture and it has been

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,360
for a very very long time from the 1970s

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,140
with the genesis of the term loser or

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,230
the 1980s with the pub or the ID 10

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,900
errors or stories of the BOF age don't

00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,720
look this up it's really gross through

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,200
the 1990s and eternal September who's

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,280
heard of eternal September okay so for

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
those of you who haven't heard of

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,500
eternal September this was the month the

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,300
day that AOL linked to use that it was a

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,360
huge cultural clash and there was a lot

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,250
of contempt built up around it

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,630
the 90s also brought us the birth of PHP

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:43,180
and the birth of hating PHP the early

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,540
2000s brought us rails and the birth of

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,980
hating rails the late 2000s brought us

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,670
the birth of node and the birth of

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,670
hating node and hating javascript the

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,320
mid 2010s has brought us amazing front

00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,820
end developers an amazing front-end

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,010
tooling of a bleeding edge of

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,350
technological development i'm the

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:06,100
dripping contempt leveled at people who

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:11,260
do their UI work and browsers we have a

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:13,080
culture that lets - Torvalds operate for

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,140
eighteen years

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,120
we epitomized - revolts we said that was

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:24,640
good that talks a cult of personality

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,830
this is our ideal and this is that

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,700
pervasive all important belief that

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,740
technical skill is all that matters and

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm not throwing stones at a culture I'm

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,660
not a part of I'm not standing on the

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,150
outside I was and am a part of this

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,570
culture and I can tell a story of that

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,400
one time I shouted get a real language

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,430
into the silence and crowded meet up

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:53,080
with over a hundred people there how

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:55,330
gross I feel a decade later but all the

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,330
times I've implied and outright stated

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,960
that anyone who uses PHP is clearly

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:04,510
clearly not very good at being a

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,170
programmer I mean if they were they

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:11,260
wouldn't use PHP right where I still

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,420
still struggle to define and describe

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,480
things in terms of pitfalls and

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,420
difficulties versus using hostile or

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,370
contemptuous language and I'm bringing

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,840
this up again not to make us feel bad

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,990
like this could be a blame session but

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,240
it's really not I'm putting this up

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,700
because this is the idea of a system a

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,060
system that we are participating in and

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,160
by framing it like that we can start to

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,220
understand the behaviors that we're

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,930
seeing without a framework to examine

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,520
this system we cannot understand the

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,459
system we cannot reason about the system

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,040
with the framework we can start to look

00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:52,540
at what people are doing why they're

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,190
doing it we can start to draw hypotheses

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,310
hypotheses that try to internalize other

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:03,830
worldviews hypotheses that are grounded

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:06,070
in you know being insulting and because

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,200
our communication is primed to be well

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,440
Wow

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:16,550
deeply unpleasant to outsiders

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,100
we need this framework we need a new set

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,370
of tools so we can start to ask new

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:25,010
questions like what has pervasive

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,940
hostility done to our context while

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:31,610
we're at our jobs what is it still doing

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,470
at our jobs and these are these are

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,980
really important questions to me because

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,410
any technology micro services or docker

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,290
or CI or hybrid cloud or whatever the

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,839
latest hotness is today all of these

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,600
things exist in a business context in an

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,160
organizational context so what we need

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,110
to talk about is the things that a

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,709
business cares about that your business

00:10:51,110 --> 00:11:00,260
that you work out cares about and well

00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:06,310
the business does not care about

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,480
technology like at all and I know I know

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:13,610
technology matters to us technology is

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,990
so cool so cool so cool I got into this

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,360
whole DevOps thing when I was writing

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,339
web softer I was writing Python and I

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,390
went up to a system and I said hey I've

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,290
written this thing could you please

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:27,350
deploy it and they sighed loudly which I

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,180
deserved and asked me to write a puppet

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,740
manifest for it so that they could

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,290
deploy and monitor and work with it

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,810
properly and I said what what is what is

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,370
puppet and if you've not heard of it

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,320
it's a configuration management tool

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,399
it's like Anza bulrush after saltstack

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:46,430
I was so cool oh we was so cool I never

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,320
ever touched it tool like this it's this

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,420
powerful distributed programming tool I

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,880
love distributed programming who loves

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,230
distributed programming so much fun

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,270
isn't it it's so like I'm in my brain

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,460
and and it forced me to consider

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,500
orchestration to consider how systems

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,920
behaved across disparate components

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,330
across an entire set of infrastructure

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,170
entire set of interconnectedness and

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,820
this was fascinating because I had to

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,100
consider programming the thing that I

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,530
had made beyond myself it was not just

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,430
my programming it existed within a

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:24,310
larger whole which led to new questions

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,160
like how does this impose costs and

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,690
dependencies and load on the other parts

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,380
of the system how does this impact

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:39,030
others how does it behave in a broader

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:43,080
context crucially what did I miss

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:46,330
what new things do I need to think about

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,250
so yeah technology is cool I love this

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,030
whole you know lambdas function as a

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,710
service world

00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,800
I love terraform which is the best and

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,520
worst tool I've ever used I love

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,040
saltstack

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,450
I hold it so dearly in my heart and even

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,310
as we migrate away from configuration

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,680
management towards the containerized

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,070
docker world I even got to speak about

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,810
it

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,500
at PyCon IU and Brisbane a few years

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,930
back it was so great but what I think is

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,570
cool what I think is neat what I am

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,270
super excited it doesn't matter to

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,480
business in the slightest what the

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,950
business cares about is outcomes

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,080
outcomes like can I keep the lights on

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,140
can I find people who will pay me nice

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,430
money's so I can make payroll and you

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,350
all get to pay your rent or the myriad

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:43,570
of other things that a business needs to

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:47,170
care about so who's had that experience

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,150
where we know we know a new technology

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,570
will save a business money like lots of

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,040
money possibly lots and lots of money

00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,200
where it will reduce workloads where it

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,480
will in the light of what that business

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,490
cares about those outcomes improve them

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,220
improve those outcomes where we know

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,840
this will happen and we've been ignored

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,360
while we're trying to pitch this

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,830
technology where we're unable to get

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,530
people to listen to what we think will

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:14,630
help

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:17,690
I've experienced this what's happening

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:21,980
that I have learned is that the business

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,440
is focusing on predictability the

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,710
existing process is known it can be

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,060
budgeted for planned reasoned about and

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:33,740
that that is what matters

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,280
knowing I can make payroll next month

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:40,970
matters more to me than maybe being able

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,160
to save money now so when we talk about

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,710
technologies we're not just asking for

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,330
the time or the cost of that time the

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,060
price of exploration and potential

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:52,160
failure we're asking for the business to

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,390
abandon no ability that ability to

00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,830
predict and budget and plan and that

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:02,800
excuse me that is a risk and in general

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,290
businesses must be very conservative

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,550
risk is what they try to manage and

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,790
they're doing this using social tools

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,770
learned over decades and if we think

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,530
about this as part of our broader system

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:18,890
as part of our history under content

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:24,530
culture we can see that a communications

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:26,870
gap has been created and this gap this

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:32,150
is actually hard it was hard for me to

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:37,580
learn this gap is not the businesses

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:39,590
fault think on what I said earlier on

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:45,280
all the ways our past effects are

00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:48,910
present and this is one of those ways we

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,550
stand on the shoulders of mistakes of

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,370
hostility and misguidance of harmful

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:58,100
behavior of being taught to express

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:03,260
ourselves in contemptuous terms and as a

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:07,640
result we are not trusted we are

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:11,690
sidelined we exist solely to be worked

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:14,030
around which anyone in InfoSec could

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,170
sell you so many stories about you

00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,610
should ask them there's probably

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:21,250
commentary about that yesterday at the

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:24,380
InfoSec panel but I digress

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:29,300
you will have seen this in action where

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,279
we build tools and we say therefore we

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,380
build tools and we say we say therefore

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,020
for ourselves that is not a good

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,690
sentence that they're good enough for us

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,240
but these very tools the tools that we

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:45,710
use and we make encode hostility and

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,500
contempt how long has it taken for good

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:52,370
tool chains for doing good open-source

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:55,880
development to exist on Windows in many

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,100
cases it has taken Microsoft themselves

00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,690
to make open-source tooling viable on

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,460
Windows to the point where they are now

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,550
the most important open-source

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,000
contributor in the world not because

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,959
it's technically difficult it's not but

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,520
because so many communities hold windows

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,809
and such low regard in such contempt

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,150
it's the point of considering even the

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:28,400
users of Windows to be beneath us to be

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:30,710
barely worth scraping off my shoe you've

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,070
seen this in the defense of attitudes

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,510
that people have when we talk to them

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,690
either when you've gone to speak to them

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,670
or when they've come to speak to you

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:44,330
where we've pushed this cultural ideal

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:47,420
of thou shalt come to me that's my thy

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:51,640
knowledge is worthless compared to my

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,640
towering knights of computer knowledge

00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:00,200
or we've styled ourselves in terms of

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:03,950
elitism like wizard or ninja ninja

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,410
developers or Rockstar devs or this is

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:12,500
my personal favorite lately the 10x

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,990
engineer and by doing these things we

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,550
have pushed ourselves to the sidelines

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,470
and this is you know not super great

00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,240
when we want to talk about the new

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,760
technologies the new processes that we

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,309
know will save time and money or when we

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,440
need to address unrealistic requests

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:31,700
like the deadline that is three months

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,210
too short and as I said this is not the

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,710
businesses fault

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:41,760
this is our fault we've done this to

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,080
ourselves and you might look back at

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,060
your own history and say no I've not

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,680
done this I've not behaved like this

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:53,450
I've never done these things but that

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,450
this sucks because that doesn't matter

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,420
you benefit and suffer from the actions

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,430
of people like you that have existed in

00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,250
a history that stretches back decades a

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,080
history that has ramifications to this

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,870
very day to this very minute

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,570
and those ramifications those histories

00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:16,200
affect what we can do today what we can

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,420
do from tomorrow onwards and to touch on

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,150
what some of those consequences look

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,010
like I'd like to bring up an article

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:27,000
that I saw in the intelligence or

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:30,200
recently I've ADHD so time is fragmented

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,350
into now recently and previously so

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,690
happened some time know where they were

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,940
talking to the founder of delicious

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,650
after they were acquired by Yahoo and

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,800
the specific line that stuck with me

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,170
from the article was if you wanted to

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,240
get hardware you went to the hardware

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,940
request committee with your proposal and

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,280
they assumed that engineers liked

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,140
spending money for no reason so you'd

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,930
have to go back and present again in two

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,850
weeks prove you really needed it so

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:05,700
that's a month gone so what can we learn

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:11,640
from this well there's a process for

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:16,500
getting hardware why why is that process

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,090
in place how do we ask why well from the

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,870
framing the founder of delicious has

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,190
offered us here it's because engineers

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:30,120
like spending money for no reason

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:33,900
okay so why does the business believe

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:40,280
that why would the business have created

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:42,930
a process that believes that because

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,610
this is important this is one of those

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,870
core things about using that new

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,620
framework and using that new way of

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,200
looking at things

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,110
this belief is an arbitrary it didn't

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,840
spring from nowhere like the Greek gods

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,170
from Titans head whose name are

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,320
forgotten anyway I digress this belief

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,809
is an arbitrary it is a consequence is a

00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,690
result of past actions that in the eyes

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:11,910
of the business were risky unnecessary

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,500
too costly it did not matter that the

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,080
founder of delicious had never done

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,690
those things never tried to buy

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,240
unnecessary hardware was never tried

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,380
that also didn't work as a sentence that

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,530
he had never tried to do risky things

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:33,510
the history the context still affected

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:35,940
him still affected his team and and as

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,090
engineers we know we care about

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,040
technology right we know we know I could

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:47,610
describe the Snyder to you and we know

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:51,320
or presume that it was necessary so if

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:58,380
we think it's necessary and they don't

00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:01,410
then that's on us we are not

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,309
communicating effectively that's on us

00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:07,140
for not telling them why it's necessary

00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:11,330
why it's risky to not have this

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,980
technology what benefits it offers and

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,870
so when engineers previously had bought

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,030
stuff and maybe it didn't work out and

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:21,660
in an accountant looked at this graph of

00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:24,510
unnecessary expenditures spend that

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,120
somehow wasn't justified or you know

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,970
maybe someone's bonus was tied to saving

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,130
money we end up with this process this

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,780
process this business belief that does

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,050
not believe in engineers does not

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,720
believe engineers a process that demands

00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:43,770
a month to ensure the money is not being

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:47,730
wasted and the future had to bear those

00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,290
consequences and that we think this is

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,800
harmful

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:55,080
well we're operating under a different

00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,490
set of assumptions than the people who

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,630
designed and implemented this process

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:06,159
and they're not better assumptions or

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:08,350
better knowledge it's just different and

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,809
in order to communicate to that to the

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,760
business why this is risky why these

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:16,149
consequences make it difficult to

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,580
address future risks why this process is

00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:23,830
not solving the problem it's intended to

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:26,919
solve we cannot speak in a language of

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,890
Technology we can not speak in our own

00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:34,419
language we can not treat our

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:37,210
assumptions as better we have to speak

00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:43,029
to the business and do it on the

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:44,950
business's terms and for decades decades

00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:47,440
our culture has taught us that we do not

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,149
have to do this it's taught us to

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,620
consider people that do not hold our

00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:55,929
kind of technical knowledge as lessor as

00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:00,429
ignorant as inherently less valuable

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:03,070
than us and the consequences of our

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,710
product alter is that we do treat people

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,610
like that with contempt with hostility

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,880
and now they're used to it from us which

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:15,909
means they are primed to not listen and

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,370
to make a change well somebody's got to

00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:20,770
start listening change isn't gonna

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:24,760
magically spring out of thin air unlike

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,559
geese change does not grow in trees yeah

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:32,470
it turns out they in the 1800 the key

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,970
screw in trees they're new and and this

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,610
might seem like a small segue but bear

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,159
with me this is important that someone

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,899
needs to start listening because the

00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,120
business does actually care about

00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:47,340
technology and you might be now going

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,640
wait wait wait wait wait wait we wait

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,640
orin orin

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:04,030
[Applause]

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,040
you've just spent the entire first act

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:10,330
telling us that technology does not

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,550
matter to the business and yes yes I did

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,900
do you want to get a picture that I know

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,720
I was telling the truth the business

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,270
doesn't care but it also does care quite

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,710
a lot about technology in the sense of

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,110
the technology that's currently being

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:29,590
used the status quo and what that

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,300
implies businesses people in businesses

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,120
they don't care about technology like we

00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,760
do but as I said they do care about

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,210
knowability about being able to have

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,940
believable estimates an existing

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,010
technological choices are knowable they

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,400
are an established process they're

00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,750
defined boundaries like that process

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,270
that I mentioned that believes that

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:57,059
engineers just want to buy unnecessary

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,800
hardware these processes and status quos

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:02,950
arise from experiences that the business

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,500
has had and there are attempts to answer

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,170
the question how do we not think about

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:12,190
this again or how do we not have that

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:14,380
failure happen again so businesses do

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,730
care about technology in the sense of

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:21,309
great problem solved good job team

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:25,870
hurray our shadow mission accomplished

00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:26,580
image there but this isn't the end of

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,990
the story

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,720
this ends and consequences consequences

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,540
like change management controls that

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,700
result in weeks or months to deploy

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:43,600
changes going through a process that we

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:48,429
look at and ask why why sad noises

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,750
intensify that's because of anxiety it's

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:52,150
because the deploy failed

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,280
perhaps catastrophic ly and it might

00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,320
have been days or weeks to manage a roll

00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,120
back or a roll forward weeks where the

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,890
business was losing money or something

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,620
critical something critical and on the

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,390
line was not working properly or it

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,000
might be reacting to legislation or

00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,110
regulatory compliance or

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,640
something happening in the news cycle

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,860
any number of things excuse me but this

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,960
is the risk that they care about that's

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,590
where the technology matters that's

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,510
where they care the most not newness but

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:27,700
stability no ability observable outcomes

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,950
and some of those triggering events may

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,110
not even happened at your business at

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,500
your employer it may have happened years

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,120
ago at previous employers and those

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,790
people brought their experiences with

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,430
them because no one can be disconnected

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:45,550
from their past or from experiences in

00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,320
that past a new employer we think of

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:52,090
them as a new as a clean slate but

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,670
they're only partially a clean slate we

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:58,540
may adopt new practices but we bring our

00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:00,580
old anxieties when we do not introspect

00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,200
we rebuild our own frame our old

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:10,030
frameworks passively implicitly only

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:16,480
sometimes explicitly and this has

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:18,580
consequences like well we all know of

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,860
the knowledge hoarders those people who

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,780
know how the technical system works why

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,180
it's the way it is what to do when it

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,760
fails and these are the people that are

00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,980
in the critical path and are enabled and

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,170
encouraged by this approach to risk

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,780
management and these people are often

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,990
very hostile my hostility and toxicity

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,390
that is encouraged and enabled by these

00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:44,110
approaches to risk management and I mean

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:46,720
that's not great I've worked with people

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:50,020
like that and I hated it they made me

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,270
feel small and ignorant and useless it's

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,250
a difficult feeling it generates

00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:57,190
impostor syndrome reinforces

00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:01,120
inadequacies and years later I still

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,680
bear those marks these people become

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,570
impediments to change they're part of

00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:09,010
that resistance to change part of that

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:11,140
stability that conservatism especially

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:15,040
when the changes are major especially

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:19,040
really really major changes like the

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,260
biggest one since 1991 89 mm-hmm

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,310
which was of course the birth of the

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:31,520
worldwide web which is of course the

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:33,170
cloud whoo with me again whoo the cloud

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,300
is a fascinating part of the modern

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,950
computing story and if someone is deeply

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,170
into DevOps as I am it's clear that in

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,990
many ways the cloud enabled truly

00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,850
enabled DevOps on a technical level

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,370
where we could finally truly experiment

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,200
and test and refine without needing to

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:52,280
go through a cumbersome bureaucratic

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,320
process to and cumbersome resistant

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,330
bureaucratic process I hate talking

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
something it's hard forcing the morning

00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,930
that we all hate the ones that say we

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,270
just want to buy hardware for fun will

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,950
now cost 30 cents just give me the

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,180
credit card

00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,460
the cloud is where infrastructure as

00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,980
code became real where automation could

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:15,740
blossom and grow far far beyond what we

00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:20,600
had before the cloud as we know it was

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:27,820
launched on March 14 2006 this is when

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:31,550
AWS released s3 sqs an ec2 to the world

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:36,680
this was actual cloud doing actual cloud

00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,130
things as of today that was 13 years

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:45,680
four months and if my math is correct 16

00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:46,940
days ago might be 17 and last year in

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,170
March I was speaking to a group of

00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,380
senior tech executives in New Zealand

00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:54,020
and I raised this point as well because

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,170
the event I was speaking at was about

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,150
dipping our toes into the cloud

00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,460
exploring maybe maybe just a little bit

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,410
of exploring this hybrid cloud where we

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:08,180
keep a lot of our stuff on Prem still in

00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:15,230
our data centers because that's safe 13

00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:18,440
years 13 years and I'm still just

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,120
starting to have those conversations the

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,810
value of the cloud the things that

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,400
enables the infra code the automation

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:28,419
those aren't the questions that need to

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,590
be answered or addressed because those

00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,029
questions don't matter those are the

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,029
questions that we care about the

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:38,799
technology that we care about business

00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:43,269
doesn't care that we can spin up a new

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,720
instance in a minute because because we

00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:51,309
are bad very very bad at communicating

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:54,009
how this impacts risk what risks it

00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:57,759
alters what risks it removes what risks

00:31:54,009 --> 00:32:01,989
it creates what it costs not in the fact

00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:06,009
that it costs 30 cents in our backs but

00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:09,090
in training in migration in what new

00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:11,859
regulatory means happen as a result and

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:14,309
all of these changes well they're

00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:16,840
anxiety inducing at the business level

00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,090
businesses want stability they want to

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,879
manage risk and they don't know because

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:25,330
we won't communicate how this change

00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:27,159
will alter their risk profile so someone

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,960
needs to communicate that change does

00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:36,879
not help happen without someone starting

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:41,320
to speak we need to communicate that but

00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:43,059
sometimes sometimes though a change will

00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,190
start and we won't have to do anything

00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:48,820
but a change will start but this whole

00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,649
DevOps thing it's a major change as I've

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,899
touched on change is a risk but somehow

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:55,840
the necessity became apparent that a

00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:58,480
change must happen maybe it was harder

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,299
to hire talent to work on our existing

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,980
things maybe we were losing critical

00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,570
people because they were like I'm tired

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,249
of this stuff I want to go play with the

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:11,440
new things over there that were written

00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:13,869
in the 2000s not the 1980s or maybe it

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,159
was coming up at industry events and

00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:20,070
they were getting peer pressure the

00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:21,999
executive level hearing about agile yes

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,700
companies are still just starting to

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:28,269
explore agile in 2019 I have clients

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,860
like this it's I'm glad they're

00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:33,080
explaining it

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,610
but regardless of the trigger a cannon

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,110
does happen a change will begin and then

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,820
it's been in an environment where

00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,380
changes started and then it is stalled

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:48,710
out and failed I have been there more

00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:54,260
than once in fact and and this is a

00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:55,910
theme oh it's a theme when it fails part

00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,500
of the reason is that communications gap

00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,500
but I keep coming back to that

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,710
keep it coming back to why is this

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,040
change valuable what risks at a business

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:08,360
level

00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,010
does it change how and this is really

00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,669
really important this is like the

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:16,880
critical thing how does it alter power

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:18,919
dynamics this is a super important

00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,340
question because power dynamics the

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,960
people who will say no they always

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,450
dictate whether or not a change can

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,669
happen and I have a story about this

00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,890
from a client and this was a big staid

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,919
conservative organization with release

00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:35,780
cycles that measured in months and they

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,490
wanted to roll docker out as part of

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,169
exploring new technology and get it at

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,450
least a little bit into their deployment

00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:43,250
pipeline and then we're running into

00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,020
issues with the release manager the

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,970
person in charge of making sure releases

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,340
were not going to break everything and

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,000
so there's a process here we fill out

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,610
some forms

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,030
we submit builds we let them get

00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,030
qualified we wait weeks at set

00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,180
and this is a sort of process the

00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,160
results in so many things getting added

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,190
to the build to maximize the return on

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,780
that time and yes Wow as a technical

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:18,370
person that doesn't that sound risky

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:23,410
lots of stuff gonna break when we chuck

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:25,960
everything in it all at once right the

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,640
people at this client knew that too so

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,680
they were trying to add doctor as part

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,710
of getting a shorter release cycle to

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,790
get CI a little bit into their pipeline

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,100
but their releases they're still owned

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:40,060
by this manager and that process still

00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:42,070
exists so they could as I have done many

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,160
times gotten frustrated and shouted at

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:47,020
the C but what they did instead was they

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,360
sat down with the release manager and

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:53,080
they said hey what are you concerned

00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,870
about what matters to you what are you

00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,290
being judged on and they weren't rude

00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,260
about it

00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,570
they weren't condescending they weren't

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,030
nice they were respectful they cared

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:07,060
about the Congress Ponce's they listened

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:10,180
to the responses they never stopped that

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,680
person and said wait no you're wrong how

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,820
many times have you done that when

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,930
someone has tried to explain something

00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:18,700
to you me I've done it heaps

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,950
because I didn't do that because no

00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,930
you're wrong is part of that

00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,880
condescension part of that contempt

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,760
culture part of that decades-long

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,950
hostility and then they took that

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,570
information they built a demo around

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,670
that and they went back and they were

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,890
like hey here's what we can do for you

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,990
with the new process that in that

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:40,960
directly impacts the things you're

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,700
concerned about and they said how does

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,800
this meet your needs does this meet your

00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,720
needs and critically because we suck at

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,100
communicating what did we miss and the

00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,250
release manager was like wow okay this

00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:57,760
gives me way more and way better

00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:00,040
information than I have right now I am

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,010
on board with your cool new fancy tech

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,250
thing this will reduce risk in many ways

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:07,570
that I care about and that's what we

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,180
want to enable that's what all of this

00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,230
is for to make the lives of others

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,230
better

00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:16,540
I think docker wasn't a technology

00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,060
decision technology wasn't a driver or a

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,550
core focus the focus here was seeing if

00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:25,780
a technology could solve a problem for

00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:28,260
someone else and understanding that the

00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,619
rest of the business had different needs

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,050
the docker

00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:32,890
was the tool being added isn't the point

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,810
of this story

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:39,010
the point is understanding that a

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:41,109
process was being affected that altering

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,530
the process in a business is a major act

00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:45,930
and that to understand that to

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,579
understand why that is

00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:54,400
we need to oh I'm gonna run way late I'm

00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:55,750
sorry I'm nearly there to understand

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,770
that we need to talk about a key concept

00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:01,450
namely that all technology is political

00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,220
and I know there's a lot of conversation

00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,170
on the internet that says no it's not

00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:12,599
spelled zigs and technology are clearly

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:17,290
disconnected clearly and they are wrong

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:20,740
fundamentally fundamentally and

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:22,839
completely wrong because I want to talk

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,089
to you about Conway's law which if you

00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,980
haven't heard of it says organizations

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:28,869
which design systems are constrained to

00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,670
produce designs which are copies of the

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:34,270
communication structures of those

00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,250
organizations what this tells us is that

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,109
technology's politics because technology

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,140
encodes the organization that made it

00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:44,230
that's all politics is really how we do

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,760
stuff how we talk to each other how we

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,910
communicate and work with our shared

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,319
values from this we can look at

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,150
technologies and we'll see one of two

00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:54,790
things either we'll see something that

00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,650
makes no sense why would anyone want to

00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,420
do these things this way look how bad it

00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,369
is in all of these ways no really this

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,160
is terrible hold on hold on I'm gonna

00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:07,420
write a think piece on medium about how

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,890
bad of an idea this is and this is

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,380
because the technology does not align

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,670
with the politics that we hold it is the

00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,040
result of a Conway's law from an

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,720
organization with different beliefs with

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,480
assumptions and axioms and ideas that

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,280
are different to our own alternatively

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,380
we might see a technology that is so

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,780
mind-blowing recorrect I wish I'd

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,750
brought galaxy brain

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,220
so immensely appropriate something that

00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:33,780
can solve all of our problems such

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,280
product very complete Wow and this is

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,440
because that technology does have

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,850
politics that align with our own it is

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,310
the result of Conway's law from the

00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:46,410
organization that operates identically

00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:48,720
but close enough and we'll see one of

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,070
those two worldviews so it's a great

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
example of this in action

00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,450
well I've touched on it really what

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,870
about docker Dockers a great example of

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,740
this

00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:00,180
who thought daughter was a terrible idea

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:04,170
who later thought daughter was a great

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,300
idea I've gone through that process I

00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,550
came up with a layer theory of DevOps as

00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,290
a result of that process I didn't learn

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,660
more about technology to do that process

00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:15,000
I merely internalized a new set of

00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,390
political assumptions ones that match

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,950
those of the dog maintainer zuv doctor

00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,570
this is why micro services isn't a

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,390
technological pattern it's a team

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,610
organization pattern it's a political

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,010
pattern it's trying to use a product of

00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:32,130
Conway's law that may be orthogonal to

00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,020
our existing politics and this this is

00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,020
why it's been 13 years and five months

00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,210
and 16 or possibly 17 days and since the

00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,870
cloud launched and we're still talking

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,640
about it as some kind of new thing it is

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,740
incompatible with the considerations in

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,510
axioms and political landscape of so

00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:52,890
many businesses and this is relevant

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:55,910
because what we think we do is work on

00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,660
technology what we need to do is

00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,570
understand the political ramifications

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,070
of technology and how that impacts the

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,880
businesses that we work in and what we

00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:08,400
actually do what we actually do is

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,450
ignore that need but without that

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,310
understanding without those

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,020
considerations we will continue to be

00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,090
frustrated those conversations will

00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:22,380
continue to be difficult that we will be

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:24,420
resentful and we will struggle I'm

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,320
almost done

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,060
then you'll get to go have morning tea

00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,240
so I'll be about five more minutes thank

00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,070
you all for your patience so I've talked

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,570
a lot about why we need to talk to

00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,100
businesses and of the assumptions that

00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,200
businesses are carrying when we come

00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,960
into those conversations and how what

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,520
we're saying isn't working but I haven't

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,760
talked about anything about how to say

00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,620
different things about new ways to think

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,510
about how we engage with process and

00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:53,080
communicate the risks and values and

00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,700
benefits of those changes so let's talk

00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,370
a little bit about how I pitch DevOps

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,380
the businesses because DevOps isn't a

00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:03,400
technology it's never been about

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:06,780
technology instead DevOps is a political

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,490
artifact technology enabled DevOps

00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,470
because all technology is political and

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,160
it required a new world view from its

00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:17,260
adopters so when we talk about DevOps

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,440
when we talk about these changes we need

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:23,260
to learn to talk about politics and to

00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,670
talk about politics well the first thing

00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,190
that I talk about when I'm talking about

00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,740
DevOps to a business is asking what the

00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,930
org chart is and I'll give me a thing

00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:36,340
that looks kind of like this and then

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:39,730
I'll ask know know what is the real org

00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:43,000
chart look like and often there will be

00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,280
some confusion I don't have a slide nice

00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,290
slide for it but the real lauric chart

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,200
the real power in an organization isn't

00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:54,220
who tells whom what to do but who owns

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,510
deadlines who owns the deadlines and

00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,540
that's an important question who owns

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:02,860
the deadlines because you can't change a

00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:06,730
process without the ability to try the

00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,470
new process and that seems obvious right

00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,940
this if we don't have time to try we

00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,950
don't have time to try it tautologies

00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,620
well it's not obvious is that when

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:17,260
things catch fire the easiest path is

00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,030
always to go back to the old process to

00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,860
the known process the one that offers

00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,210
believable estimates a process that

00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,180
could say it will take a week to

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,280
definitely fix or a month to definitely

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,680
ship and I can come along and say well

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,970
the new process might take an hour to

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:37,240
ship or it might take three months might

00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,580
I don't need might I need to know

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,550
thank you right now you guarantee it

00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:45,369
guarantee we'll take an hour we can't do

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:46,930
that and this isn't just outages or

00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:49,840
things being on fire this applies to

00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,600
shipping deadlines to meeting shipping

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,940
deadlines to getting product to market

00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,520
and without that space to explore an

00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:03,090
experiment without that ability to alter

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,090
deadlines we can't change the politics

00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:11,080
the second major thing I pitch is ways

00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,900
to stop being so insular we are so

00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,369
really very terrible at this because we

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,740
bear the burden of history being

00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:21,580
terrible and insulting and caustic to

00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:23,200
people who aren't us but we must go and

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,660
figure out who will be affected by our

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,390
proposed changes we need to ask them

00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,770
about their concerns and their needs and

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,110
we need to do it while understanding

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:36,700
that they will be defensive they will

00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:38,640
expect us to make their lives worse and

00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,250
not just a little bit worse a lot worse

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,609
and we will have to keep managing it

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:49,000
over and over every day because they

00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:52,690
will not come to us unless they are

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,750
forced to they have no reason to do so

00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,369
and I'd like to tell a little story that

00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,800
I heard at Kiwi Con and it's not my

00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:01,960
story this is a story from Etsy and how

00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,310
they worked to get InfoSec now we're

00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,109
having a problem with InfoSec into a

00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:08,230
place where it could be more effective

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:09,700
as a team and the InfoSec team started

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,950
out in the corner as many technical

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:14,230
teams do and they in that very much

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,500
stereotypical mindset of hissing at the

00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,510
light of intruders and this clearly

00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,140
wasn't working they were seeing a lot of

00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,490
security events that were concerning

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,070
when an event happened it wouldn't get

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,840
reported people expected to be shouted

00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:32,290
at or belittled if they brought

00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,440
something up to InfoSec that's contempt

00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,310
culture and this is clearly not

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,490
sustainable

00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:42,070
good InfoSec is a huge deal so what Etsy

00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,450
did was they moved the InfoSec team like

00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,850
physically moved them out from the dark

00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:47,830
corner into the middle of the office so

00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,910
that everyone going anywhere had to walk

00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,769
by them

00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:54,180
they stopped hiring the caustic people

00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:56,289
they fired the really egregious ones and

00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,940
and this was the part that I thought was

00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,970
really interesting was the InfoSec

00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,420
people put out a jar of lollies on a

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,980
scale and is it anyone can have one just

00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,799
come by pick up a lolly it's fine and

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,000
they measured as one does the

00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,799
correlation between the number of

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,410
security events and the weight of the

00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:19,539
law is in the jar and they saw the

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,970
number of agate of events decrease the

00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:24,069
fewer lollies were in the jar so they

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,630
reasoned they hypothesized that the

00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:27,579
reason was people were passing by and

00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,470
taking some candy and stopping to have a

00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,960
chat and because they had worked on

00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:34,809
their culture the InfoSec team was able

00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,490
to start talking friendly in a friendly

00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,609
way starting to share good InfoSec

00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:41,980
practice to make it not terrifying to

00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:44,170
come and speak with them in the end when

00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,269
something bad happened because they made

00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,069
the conversation safe I keep seeing that

00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:53,200
lady's wonderful earrings I think and

00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:55,119
they're awesome go you people at Etsy

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,609
had to be given a reason to talk to the

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,440
InfoSec team the team had to change how

00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,809
they communicated what they communicated

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,910
and why they were communicating it and

00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:06,190
by managing that relationship by

00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:08,769
learning to manage our relationships to

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:12,309
the business we can start being involved

00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:14,289
in the conversations where we need to be

00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:16,029
involved we can start offering

00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,339
improvements on other people's lives and

00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:20,769
processes and needs and dismantle the

00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:21,339
idea that we are going to say no or make

00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:24,970
their lives

00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:27,309
infinitely harder or actually be really

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:32,559
really not great in front of clients

00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:34,720
because that happens as I've touched on

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,299
so much we don't speak this business

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,190
very well I can't teach you how to do it

00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:42,579
there's lots of books on the subject and

00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:45,640
you need to learn to do it this will be

00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:48,069
in financial terms but more than that it

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,170
will be in terms of risk and benefit and

00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:51,309
understanding how they need to hear

00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,769
about risks and benefits

00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:55,930
this will require writing roadmaps

00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:58,349
considering what's important today and

00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:02,549
what can wait and why it can wait you

00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,549
will need to answer learn to answer

00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,470
like what level of risk are you willing

00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:09,690
to adopt here and one of the questions

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:11,430
that I asked when doing disaster

00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:15,450
recovery planning with my clients is how

00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:19,820
much data are you willing to lose is it

00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:24,390
a week's worth of data a day an hour

00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:28,920
half an hour nothing nothing is

00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:31,230
impossible but this tells us how much Dr

00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,710
automation we need what level of backups

00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:36,750
we need I can also ask how long is it ok

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,850
for you to be offline and then we can

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:41,270
get our number of nines and through most

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,010
businesses need five nines of uptime

00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:47,820
probably not do they need two nines of

00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:52,470
uptime probably not and if not why

00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:53,760
aren't we building to that level and as

00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,860
part of writing these roadmaps I'm

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,600
really close to them writing these

00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,460
roadmaps you should also be considered

00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,990
be considering that there is no such

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,510
thing as a perfect implementation

00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:06,270
there's just what meets our needs today

00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:10,290
and what we can hopefully expand to me

00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:13,410
to meet our needs later and again you'd

00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:15,990
think this would be obvious but I hear

00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,580
all the time and you've probably heard

00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,850
it too and probably said it because I

00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:25,950
know I have oh but we built this wrong

00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:32,670
and if we just done it right in the

00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:33,570
beginning surprised you couldn't it was

00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,600
impossible

00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,970
there's just what you can do at the time

00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:42,300
how you can adapt to what you will need

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:44,120
now and how to make it may be possible

00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:48,030
to change to what you need in the future

00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:49,220
but surprise you'll be wrong about that

00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:52,650
too

00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,940
so please if we could just get if one

00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,780
thing and one thing you take from this

00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,740
is stop saying if we just done it right

00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,050
the world will be infinitely better

00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:03,810
because it is a part of that caustic and

00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:06,870
insulting and critical and contemptuous

00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:08,310
worldview that caustic language it

00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:12,150
denigrates everything that came before

00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:14,760
it tells us that anyone who did work

00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,739
that wasn't our work had no idea what

00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,839
they were doing

00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:20,519
it ignores completely ignores the

00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:25,829
context and constraints and limitations

00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:29,729
of their work the final thing the very

00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:32,309
final thing all of this leans on empathy

00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:34,499
on recognizing that other people have

00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:36,690
different needs and goals and pressures

00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:39,150
and priorities and that you as

00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:43,729
technologists need to participate in

00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:46,259
that and that's all DevOps is really

00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:47,910
I've just spent 50 minutes telling you

00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:50,579
that it's be empathetic to other

00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:53,849
technical teams meeting the needs of

00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:56,479
others but DevOps isn't just technical

00:50:53,849 --> 00:51:00,809
teams it's the entire organization and

00:50:56,479 --> 00:51:03,539
we you and I and everyone you meet are

00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:06,059
part of making that change we are

00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:08,009
growing that way as a culture we all

00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,859
need to be a part of it Linus

00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:12,719
stepped down he said actually everything

00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:19,709
I've done was bad I'm gonna try to

00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:21,019
change and that my dear friends is what

00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:23,759
I've learned from talking to your boss

00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:26,430
that we must listen and understand and

00:51:23,759 --> 00:51:28,349
empathize though we must discard broken

00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:33,329
and internally inconsistent ideas like

00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:35,789
merit or done right and by doing this we

00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:41,839
can achieve new goals and build a better

00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:41,839
future for everyone thank you

00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:54,920
