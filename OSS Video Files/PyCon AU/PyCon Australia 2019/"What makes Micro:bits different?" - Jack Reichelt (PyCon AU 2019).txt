well hi everybody um I kind of forgot

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,179
that there was an entry bit so we can

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,990
skip most of this slide but the key

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,219
point is that I like micro bits so that

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,220
leads us straight to our first point

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,970
which is what is a micro bit and the

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,470
answer is this it's very small and you

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,890
probably can't see it from back there

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,390
but people near the front there are ten

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,240
of them down here if you would like to

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,130
come and grab them and pass them around

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,809
have a little look and see you see what

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,969
they are and so on dive in now and pass

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,680
them around have a fun have a play press

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,219
the buttons have a look cool so while

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,200
that's happening also what's on them

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,700
will work best if all of them are gone

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,739
so I'm just gonna

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,520
Bruce fine friends so while they're

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,410
going out here's a quick little overview

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,090
of what's on a micro bit it's got a lot

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,250
of stuff packed into a really small

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,439
package we've got a lot of LEDs on the

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,060
front we've got these two buttons it's

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,960
got a compass and an accelerometer

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,250
it's got bluetooth and radio and it's

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,290
got this edge connector for connecting

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,540
all sorts of accessories which I will

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,180
come to later but it means that there's

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,909
a whole lot going on here but what does

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,350
this mean for teaching micro bits well

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,720
in broad strokes it's a there's an

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:36,750
element of physicality to it when you're

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,340
teaching say just normal Python it's on

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,040
the computer it's probably in the

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,409
command line to begin with and it can

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,170
feel really removed and super abstract

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:51,600
but with the micro bit which runs micro

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,880
Python it's right here you can see it it

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,979
has a while true loop and I'll come to

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,649
why there's a wild true loop in almost

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,820
every micro bit program later but this

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,229
makes it quite different to teach

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,210
because you probably don't introduce

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,740
while loops and certainly not wild true

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,330
loops for quite a while if you're

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,790
teaching Python normally timing matters

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:16,080
when you're running a normal Python

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,950
program it runs start end and the time

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,540
you doesn't matter so much

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,220
whatever you've put in happens in the

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,810
order you've put it in they might be

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,120
loops but you don't care too much about

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,070
how fast they are until you're bit along

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,450
your journey but timing really matters

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,680
with the micro bit and I'll come to why

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,000
later there are attachments as I said

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,550
with the edge connector and as you can

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,110
see but as you're passing them around

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,730
there's a bunch of little gold plated

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,160
pins down the bottom and there's one

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,220
that says 3v which is the power supply

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,280
three volts there's a GND for ground

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,930
it's way to connect that back up and

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,220
there's a bunch of data pins and some of

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,750
them are more special than others

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,959
there's the three real big ones there's

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,230
a lot of tiny ones and lastly it's got a

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,820
radio and this is actually a really big

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,590
thing the radio is great so what does

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,630
the physicality actually mean so it's

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,150
right there you can see it you can feel

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,650
it when the program doesn't work you can

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,230
see how it doesn't work a lot of the

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,850
time if you say yeah if you're expecting

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,250
it to show a smiley face and it shows a

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,580
sad face it's not just some text on a

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,590
screen it's lights on the micro bit and

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,750
that really works well for a lot of kids

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,280
it means it's super fun because it's

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,580
there and because you can pass it around

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,860
and you know have a look it's really

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,030
engaging and the flip side to really

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,920
engaging is that it is super distracting

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,730
kids will spend a lot of time playing

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,680
with the micro bits that's probably okay

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,739
in my opinion I think the trade-offs are

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,150
well worth it and I know that I've spent

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,230
a lot of time distracted by the micro

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,269
bits so because there's physicality the

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,459
students find it more real it's a

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,760
real-world thing and that can be a big

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,130
jump for a lot of students I know when I

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,330
was first laying in a program a lot of

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,850
the stuff that I learned I was just like

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,709
okay sure I can see how to do maths in a

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,570
programming language but why do I care

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,410
when am I gonna do maths or you know I

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,500
can like I'm yeah I can't put it

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,900
together I didn't see what I was trying

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,090
to do but with a micro bit you

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,199
it's like okay well I want this to

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,419
happen when I press the button on the

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,850
micro bit and it connects a lot better

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,520
this means that different and hopefully

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:36,449
more students get engaged by the micro

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,250
bit it can be hard to engage students I

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,810
certainly have come across this but I

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,860
find the micro fits a really good way to

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,180
get around this and lastly and this

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,979
plays into the distraction though

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,690
they'll want to show their friends what

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,940
they make and I think this is a really

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,010
good thing it's great to be excited

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,229
about something you've made and it's

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,520
great to make something and then hand it

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,800
off to your friends and then they go how

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,449
did you make that and you share with

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,430
them and you teach each other and you

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:06,800
build bigger and better things together

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:09,030
that's how learning works really well so

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,880
that's how the physical elements are

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,419
different but I mentioned this while

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,180
true loop

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,180
why don't we need a while true loop well

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,710
let's look at a code example here here's

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,240
a simple micro bit Python program and

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,669
all it does is when you press the a

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,530
button as long as you're holding it down

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,169
it shows a happy face on the micro bit

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:36,389
if you let go it shows a sad face on the

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:39,330
micro bit it likes attention so why do

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:42,389
we need the while true loop well in a

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,979
normal Python program and most programs

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,370
things run top to bottom that's true

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:49,530
here but the micro bit by virtue of

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,389
being a physical device not something

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,729
there's a Run button to hit there's no

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,849
terminal you means hit enter well no

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,070
interpreter where you go line by line

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:00,510
you connect the battery pack or you hit

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,800
the reset button on the back and it just

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:07,530
goes all done for a physical device

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,240
that's not super good it can work if you

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,130
have lots of sleeps and it's doing one

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,080
thing and there's no interactivity but

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,280
then we kind of well why are we using a

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,860
physical device if there's no

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,900
interactivity and you're just gonna you

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,310
know you're not making use of what you

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,340
have so we have this wild true loop so

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,690
this program will just keep going and

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,710
this is the format that you'll see for a

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,690
lot of embedded systems programming it's

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,840
it's frequently referred to as the main

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,139
loop

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,570
and it's just where most of its going to

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,310
happen but there are some drawbacks to

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,310
it and some things to consider when

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:50,530
teaching it firstly is that loops are

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,730
scary I don't know how long all of you

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,400
have been programming but if you think

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,990
back to when you learned loops can be

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,970
really tricky and it it's something that

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,580
you would introduce a bit later you know

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,300
a couple of weeks in if you're teaching

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,830
just Python in the interpreter but with

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,690
a micro bit you really need to introduce

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,980
it pretty much at the beginning because

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,470
otherwise there's not a lot that can be

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,880
done with a micro bit so you need to

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,680
introduce something that's a bit more

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:23,530
advanced really early so how fast are

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,870
they as well so a micro pig runs at 16

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,520
megahertz and so this loops actually

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,110
gonna be happening really fast a lot of

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
the time I know it's nothing like any of

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,669
the laptops that anybody's gonna have

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,860
here but to a human 16 megahertz is

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:38,740
really fast I'm certainly not that fast

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,560
at anything but the students don't

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,330
understand that initially and so you get

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,729
questions like what happens if I press a

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,080
after the loop they don't understand

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,880
what the loop does and they don't

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,610
realize that there is no after the loop

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,650
so you've got to guide them through to

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,050
that and help them realise that any code

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,070
that isn't nested inside that loop is

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,870
never gonna happen

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,030
I've also had the inverse what happens

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,120
if I press aide before the loop and they

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,340
really don't realize initially that it

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,370
gets to that while true and starts doing

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,460
that instantaneously as far as a human

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,840
can tell from my perspective there is no

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,800
before the loop so when the loop goes

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,050
that fast

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120
what does timing even mean how do i how

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,900
do we time things that are going too

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,460
fast for us well in micro Python for the

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,800
micro bit we have two different ways to

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,830
check what the state of a button is we

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,950
have is pressed and was pressed so

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,229
what's the difference between those is

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,680
pressed checks at the very instant you

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,270
call it if the button is held down this

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,400
is really good for things like that

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,900
simple program before when you just want

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,680
to show a happy face if the buttons held

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,630
down and

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,420
thing else if it's not and you don't

00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,250
care about sort of you know that program

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,540
didn't actually care about timing too

00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,040
much was pressed is more complicated and

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,279
checks if the button has been held down

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,970
since the last time the button was

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,820
checked this is really complicated and

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,360
once you get to this for teaching

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,480
microbe its teaching was pressed can be

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,020
you're a Multi multi class endeavor it

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,520
is a extremely complicated topic and is

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,279
hard to get your head around the first

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,060
time so how do we see the difference

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,980
well here's a program that checks if

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,770
button a is pressed and shows a happy

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,779
face but also checks if button B was

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:41,800
pressed and shows a sad face so what

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,209
happens when I hold down button a if I

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,480
hold down button a and we go through

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:49,029
this program it's just like the happy

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,649
face program that we saw before it's

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,500
checking if button is pressed it's

00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,500
showing the happy face from for a second

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,320
sleep counting milliseconds and then it

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,330
clears it so if you just hold down a

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,790
it'll show the happy face wait for a

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,040
second clear it and then as a human can

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,080
see as far as a human can see instantly

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,209
puts the happy face back up again you

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,990
never see a difference if you hold down

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:17,410
button be either button B is was pressed

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,540
it checks has the button being pressed

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,610
since the last time we called was

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,089
pressed if it's the first time it checks

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,980
since the start of the program so

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,980
holding down button B you'll see the sad

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,290
face for a second and it'll go away I'm

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,390
still holding down button B but it's not

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:39,150
a new hold so it's not gonna show us the

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:41,470
sad face again there are other

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,930
possibilities as well what happens if I

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,350
press button a and then while the happy

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,630
face is showing press button B well

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,899
button B only cares if it was pressed

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,790
and so then it will immediately show the

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:58,029
sad face as soon as the happy face has

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,300
gone away the opposite where we press

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,060
button B and then press

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,980
a button a is only checking if it is

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,840
pressed so it doesn't care if you could

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,090
press it you know 20 times in the one

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,590
second that the sad face is showing it

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,580
really cares that if you're holding it

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,200
down after the sad face has gone away so

00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,790
this is a quick overview of the

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,200
difference between is Preston was

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:25,350
pressed and there are loads more of your

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,170
niche edge cases of you know how do you

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,990
do ending to was pressed sand all that

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,820
sort of complicated stuff that I don't

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,040
have time to go into here but if you are

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,050
gonna teach micro a bit knowing that

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,270
there is a trap there is essential

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,700
because you've got to learn how to

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:46,350
handle that yourself so next up we have

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,720
attachments this is where micro bits can

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,700
get really fun so this is just a few

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,620
types of things that you can connect a

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,140
micro bit to you can see a micro bit in

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,430
each of those photos and you can see

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,100
they're doing all sorts of different

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,600
things one's a little buggy ones what's

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,490
called the 7-segment display that's

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,570
showing the numbers as LED strip and

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,670
there's a little sort of gamepad

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,780
controller thing yes you can have the

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,340
gamepad control the buggy but there are

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,300
all sorts of more things you can attach

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,010
and you know basically anything any

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,200
circuit you can build so even if you

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,450
can't buy an off-the-shelf component

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,090
with some electrical knowledge you can

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,330
build really complicated things and run

00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:30,060
them with a micro bit so this gives us a

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,740
lot of freedom we can change what we're

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,380
doing with our microbial by attaching

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,330
different things it enables and

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,730
encourages creativity because students

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,350
can decide what they want to attach and

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,560
how they want to attach things and how

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:49,140
they want those things to interact this

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:52,650
is really good for the students who have

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,270
found that like this is really good for

00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,370
the students who want to push themselves

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,880
and get a little further and see real

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,860
what they can really do with the system

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,290
and because it allows bigger projects to

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,440
be put together simply one of these ways

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,070
to make a bit bigger project is radio

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,710
sir the micro bit has an inbuilt

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,240
radio on it with a radio library that is

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,119
really

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,999
and simple to use this is great because

00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:22,360
communications are cool one micro bit

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,369
neat you can connect a few things to it

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,459
multiple microwaves talking together now

00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:31,879
things start to get interesting but who

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:34,009
actually understands networking and who

00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:39,559
understood networking when they were 10

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:45,230
years old it's really hard and I don't

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:48,740
understand it but micro bit radio just

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,889
works it's really easy to set up and get

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,629
running and I have a super quick example

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,889
of that so those micro bits that have

00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:56,089
been floating around hands up if you

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,040
still got one you don't need to bring it

00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,749
back just yet have you noticed that

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,990
occasionally a letters appearing on the

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:07,519
screen yeah okay a few no it's cool so

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,170
those 10 micro bits that went out are

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:15,019
actually five pairs of micro bits I've

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,929
written this program here alright this

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:22,549
last night it did not take long this is

00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:26,480
the extent of the program and what this

00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:28,540
does is we turn on the radio we you

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,939
choose our channel and the letter and we

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,209
configure the radio to join that channel

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:36,790
then in our wild true loop if either

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,850
button was pressed

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,399
we send our letter on the other micro

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,749
bit oh and then afterwards because it's

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,999
all part of the same loop it's the same

00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:52,100
program running on each pair or each

00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:54,589
micro bit of the pair we receive so the

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,689
radio don't receive just checks if

00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,209
there's a message waiting for it and if

00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:01,670
there isn't it just sets it a turn none

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,709
otherwise it gets whatever message was

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,019
sent so here we check if there's we have

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,939
received a letter that matches our

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,619
correct one I did that just in case

00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,119
anybody else has a micro bit that's on

00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:12,499
the same channel sending random letters

00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,730
I didn't think it was likely but I

00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,730
thought let's do some proofing

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,330
and then we're going to show our letter

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,000
wait half a second and then clear the

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:27,580
display and then we can do it again so

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,860
if we have a look who who has managed to

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,150
find their partner has anybody found to

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,690
micro bits that are matched yeah we've

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:39,970
got a pair over here cool does anybody

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:43,560
else want to gather them like find their

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,560
pairs and bring the micro bits back

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,670
brackets that's I need those micro bits

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
they don't I don't I don't earn them and

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:57,040
I would like them to come back please

00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:09,240
ironed one of them iron a nice oh that's

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:13,030
the one I really care about cool sir in

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,210
summary micro Brits are great would

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:19,180
highly recommend thanks for coming to my

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,470
talk and I figured there's probably

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,270
gonna be a lot of questions so let's

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,670
leave a lot of time to questions because

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,620
they're weird and I think a lot of

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,000
people haven't come across them too much

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,770
actually that's a good question from me

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,380
to you raise your hand if you've used a

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,720
micro bit before oh that's a lot of you

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,360
cool raise your hand if you use the

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,860
radio on the micro bit before actually

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,330
that's hard a thing to pass put your

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,630
hand up if you use the micro bit but

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,120
haven't used the radio before

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:51,940
okay cool a few you cool well are there

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,220
any questions hey thanks for the talk

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,430
just wondering how susceptible they are

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,860
to electrostatic discharge um so I keep

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:06,390
you I'm keeping all these in a static

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:08,470
bag to be frank I don't know there's

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,130
there's a man over there in a red shirt

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,130
who might know

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,300
that's a good point yeah yes

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,160
so I teach to the Sun school called the

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,170
national computer science school we use

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,449
several hundreds of them in a year and

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,740
we have for the past three four years

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,000
and we've not destroyed a single one

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:40,420
despite them being handled and used by

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,720
hordes of teenagers one button fell off

00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:59,980
once so I think that's pretty good on

00:17:43,720 --> 00:18:04,840
the durability rating sir happening

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,580
underneath that there are interrupts he

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,580
said raising his eyebrow at the person

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:16,840
who works at the microvia foundation no

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:23,710
interrupts yeah that's what I thought

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:26,380
cool yes yes so there are no interrupts

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,300
below there are in talks behind the

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,100
scenes but the Python code doesn't work

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,760
on interrupts it's all done with things

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,050
like the was pressed which checks the

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,450
state of variable set by those

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:42,850
interrupts cool I could share maybe

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,450
something that students invented on

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,610
their own

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,110
yeah for sure we've had lots of

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,680
interesting projects at the summer

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:53,440
school that students have been invented

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:57,790
some of the best ones have been micro be

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,220
ins of other of pre-existing games so

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,930
we've had students do straight-up dance

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,030
dance revelution they've made big

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,160
buttons on the floor they've connected

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,290
micro bits and then you know they do the

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,970
whole dancing thing on these big buttons

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,610
that they've made we've had them make

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:17,490
puppets we had one year a bunch of kids

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:19,810
make basically a laser skirmish game I

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,920
don't fully know where they got the

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,920
laser but they had one

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:34,309
okay well it's his fault

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:38,390
and yeah so all sorts of creative ideas

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:40,250
and and a lot using the buggies as well

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,590
you've had we've had kids to something

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,110
like attach the micro bit to a

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,850
participant check the accelerometer to

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,559
see if they're doing like a push up and

00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,840
then the buggy does a race and it's a

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,610
competition to see who can do the most

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,840
pushups the fastest yeah it's what

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:13,850
Amanda said there it's basically based

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:15,919
on torture what's oh how young um it

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,230
depends micro bits are super expensive

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,510
also if you're just doing stuff with the

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,610
buttons on the micro bit then I would

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,799
say as young as you're comfortable

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,740
teaching Python so I would I would say

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,510
probably you know twelve early teens

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,190
that sort of range if you're doing stuff

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,659
with the buggies and more complicated

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,580
things and attachments and building

00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,010
circuits you're starting to look at mid

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,480
to late teens then but you'll always

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,140
have the outlying students who can do

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:57,110
better and more driven purely because

00:20:42,140 --> 00:21:00,020
they want to spend the time I believe

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,669
you can jump into micro Python I believe

00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,580
pythons a really good programming

00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:06,530
language to learn with even if you've

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,740
never done anything like scratch before

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,929
if you go to the groaning blog I have a

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,610
blog post about why python is good to

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:19,179
teach and yeah so I think they can

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,179
really just dive in

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,140
oh yeah also on the grok learning

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:26,420
website we do have a micro bit

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,710
playground that uses blockly which is a

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,840
lot like scratch and so we can program

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,970
you can program micro bits using block

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,770
Li and not only that but the graph

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,660
planning website has a download button

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,850
where you can put it onto a real micro

00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,030
bit instead of the simulated ones in the

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,350
growth learning website and that's easy

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,990
enough to use that that's how I

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,520
programmed all of these I didn't use a

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:54,320
more real editor and it's worth

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,820
mentioning as well that the micro bit

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,950
foundation also has a block based

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,570
environment too so there are the lock

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,730
options if you want to work with really

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,740
young students as well as the the

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,600
micropipette option as far as coding

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,580
with a text-based language guys micro

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,580
Python is by far the easiest entry point

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:28,250
it is open source yes and you can

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:31,160
contribute I the micro bit foundation's

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,750
website probably guides you to how to

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:48,170
contribute I can't say I have

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:50,840
contributed but you can go so quick Paul

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:54,590
raise your hand if you've ever written a

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,090
program to do Bluetooth stuff cool keep

00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,240
your hand up if you enjoyed that

00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,240
experience

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:08,850
okay you're an anomaly yeah okay well

00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:12,240
the short answer is this is a whole

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,370
radio program radio dot on you don't

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,779
need to config the old defaults of the

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,129
same channel so if you're just doing

00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,570
something yourself and not in the

00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,909
classroom you don't even need that line

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:24,389
and then it's radio dot send and radio

00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:26,490
dot receive that's all there is to doing

00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:29,909
radio and Python it's pretty configured

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,830
it connects super easily there's

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:35,399
something like 80 I'm one of the 88

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,919
channels maybe 86 I don't know 80

00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:39,299
something channels so lots of you know

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,769
you have to have a real big classroom

00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,549
before you're getting into trouble there

00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:46,440
and yeah I think the radio is just a

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:51,480
much better solution than Bluetooth

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,070
because it's easier takes less code

00:23:51,480 --> 00:24:08,179
space which is important on a small

00:23:53,070 --> 00:24:10,049
device yes you can send 253 bytes it's

00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:11,700
256 plus some stuff at the beginning

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,519
well and there's some stuff at the

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,690
beginning so 253 bytes so quite a lot

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,399
and I believe that's actually

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,559
configurable and you can choose a longer

00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:25,049
size as well but I haven't tried that

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:27,529
I've never sent more than 250 bytes good

00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,529
question

00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:34,799
what is the gender balance amongst your

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:42,389
student and do you need to do anything

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:44,399
to maintain interest so at the national

00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:46,740
computer science school particularly in

00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:49,649
summer camp we work really hard to have

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,659
a good gender balance in part because

00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:53,340
it's invite-only camp and so it's easy

00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,460
to do that we look through how many

00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:02,039
applicants we have and sort that out

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:06,110
I find that microbe it's actually sort

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,570
of you know way balanced that a lot

00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:11,870
because you can come at it with that

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:15,240
creative aspect that typically

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:18,630
young women have been more encouraged to

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,550
pursue you can take that path in as

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,680
opposed to taking the strictly logical

00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,960
path that young boys are more typically

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:28,290
encouraged to pursue and from there you

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,920
can get everybody into tech and uplift

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:36,090
everybody and I haven't found as much

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:38,760
difficulty as keeping girls involved and

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:56,270
engaged as I have with teaching straight

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:58,980
Python yes you can program them in

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,500
JavaScript I know for sure and if you go

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,580
to Microsoft's make code that's the

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,080
language that they offer

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:11,490
apart from blocks and I suspect probably

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,770
see I know that I mean yep see cool you

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,330
can program them and see and maybe

00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,920
others I'm sure that people have kludged

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,730
all sorts of things on 2 micro bits but

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,920
definitely other languages a little

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,360
micro pipe that are available yes and

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,210
it's worth pointing out that the most

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,540
recent update to the micro big website

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,460
now encourages Python as the go-to

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:37,280
text-based language which is really cool

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,280
so yeah micro pythons specifically yes

00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,809
I just wondered where you can buy them

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:51,030
and how much they cost um great question

00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:55,490
they are quite cheap they're about 35

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:59,760
Australian dollars for a micro bit and

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:01,590
you can buy them off the kit Ronix

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,910
website you can buy them off little bird

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:12,780
electronics je car even get in just

00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:14,100
popping in to JK you can get them by

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,690
anyone who's providing electronics to

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,120
schools is basically stocking these now

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,280
and the more you buy the cheaper you get

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,090
them so yes get them down at about 20 if

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:33,419
you're willing to buy a thousand yeah

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:35,580
think of the savings why should I be

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:41,520
excited about this class and involved in

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:42,809
it because of the possibility I think

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,650
you should be excited because of the

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,750
possibilities you have I think a really

00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,419
great thing to do with a micro bit is to

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:55,350
spend a bunch of time teaching and

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,030
giving them tools and attachments that

00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,950
they can use and learn and so on and

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,070
then giving them a sort of more freeform

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,650
project and being like well make a

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,870
project probably themed around a topic

00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,480
that the teacher has decided so that you

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:12,000
know and probably get the project

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,669
approved with the teacher first but make

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,799
a project and and let the student guide

00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:19,110
themselves I think I works really well

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,450
because then it's not oh yeah we got

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,770
more homework and we have to do I know

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,770
why this kids voice is deeper than mine

00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:31,559
yeah we got more homework and we have to

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,330
do that it's hey I'm inventing a thing I

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,770
know when I was a kid I wanted to be an

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,900
inventor I think it's a really strong

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,360
Drive I think everybody wants to create

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,549
something and if you're given the

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,909
opportunities and the support and the

00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:46,679
equipment I think just the freedom of

00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:53,720
creating something that you have decided

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,720
