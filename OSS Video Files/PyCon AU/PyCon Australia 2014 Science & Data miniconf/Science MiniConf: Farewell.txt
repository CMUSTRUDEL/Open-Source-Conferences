a couple of people ask me why we did

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,000
this mini conference and I thought it'd

00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:14,389
be worth while talking about it in the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,320
context of today but also for next year

00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:20,460
it was obvious from the last for Python

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,740
conferences that there was a local

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,980
community of people doing science

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,530
engineering big data with python and the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,860
talks tended to be scattered through the

00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,559
main conference and so last year a

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,629
couple of us spoke about having a mini

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,129
conference where people who were from

00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:40,609
the science community who may not

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,570
naturally come to pike on a you or

00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:45,780
Python programmers who had a bit of

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,339
interest in science could come together

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,940
on one day where people were really

00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:53,699
encouraged to give talks and I think the

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,559
fact that we only had a couple of talks

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,170
out of the original call for papers for

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,089
the main conference here today the bulk

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,999
of the papers came in the follow-up call

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:04,710
for papers showed that people when they

00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:07,409
have a forum to talk about science

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,160
engineering big data would happily step

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,080
up and talk about it we had more papers

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,140
than we had slots and we actually

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,760
juggled the time slots a bit to fit

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,400
everyone in as best as we could and we

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,380
still had to knock some people back I

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,950
think that really shows that the level

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,290
of interest so once again a very big

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,670
thank you to the people who have spoken

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,010
today really appreciated some thanks

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,420
firstly as I've already said thank you

00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,520
to all of the speakers and can we have

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,150
another round of applause for the people

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,150
who've got up and spoke

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,090
thank you to everyone who's attended we

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,740
had over a hundred people apparently who

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,810
signed up for this mini comp which has

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,299
blown me away I was hoping we had at

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,659
least the speakers plus it and I turn up

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,100
and I had no idea until last night how

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,789
many people were going to be here so

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,940
just totally in all of the turnouts been

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,830
really good thank you to the conference

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,230
organizers Clinton in particular who's

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,049
gone out of his way to help us every

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,780
step of the way and to edge who's helped

00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,780
coach share this with me thank you to

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,739
all of the conference sponsors and I'm

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,209
not going to list them all because

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,519
they're going to get plugged a lot along

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,500
the way but I do want to thank Python

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,599
charmers and planet innovation who have

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:37,799
backed it and I in getting all of this

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:41,250
organized and finally this is not the

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:44,069
last slide this one is our names our

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,390
email addresses we're here for the rest

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,640
of the conference i'm here for the

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,410
sprints i think Eddie's as well we'd

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,209
really encourage your feedback of both

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,329
what's worked and also what hasn't

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,889
worked we would like to run this mini

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:59,420
conf again there's obviously the

00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,709
interest and as a community of

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,569
scientists engineers people working in

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:09,359
Big Data who use Python it is up to all

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,519
of us to make this what we want and I

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,650
really encourage you to come and have a

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
conversation with us about how you think

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,579
this could be even better next year

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,590
we've already got plenty of ideas having

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:23,060
tried to get this organized and juggling

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,989
full-time jobs and doing it interstate

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,690
we definitely think we can do a better

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,569
job of it next year and really encourage

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,930
you to help us with improving it thank

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,930
you everyone

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,319
