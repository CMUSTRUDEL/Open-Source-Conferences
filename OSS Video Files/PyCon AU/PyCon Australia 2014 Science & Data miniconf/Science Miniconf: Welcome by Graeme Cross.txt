	00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:16,550
hi good morning so my name is Ed

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,949
Schofield and I'll be introducing this

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,300
out thursday so first of all welcome

00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:23,300
thanks for coming so it's time very

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,980
exciting to have this that we're

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,400
organizing for the first time as part of

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,720
pike on Australia to have a science of

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,820
day-to-day so um so yeah we've got a

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,820
full program of talks and it's going to

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,980
be it's going to be very interesting so

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,010
it's some to privilege me to be able to

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,250
be introducing this today okay so I'm

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,960
first of all some general information so

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,760
i suppose the most important point that

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,920
I think the conference organizers have

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,080
asked me to to say is the dinner

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,120
reservations and up on the wiki so if

00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,700
you like to go to dinner tonight then

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,009
I'm pleaser please reserve there and

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,729
there we tables reserved for dinner so

00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,650
I'm next there there's Wi-Fi Wi-Fi

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,550
details there there also up here on this

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,110
um on this whiteboard okay and lunch

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,790
won't be catered by morning tea and

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:22,310
afternoon tea will be okay so I thought

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,800
I don't say a few words about about

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:28,820
Python for science and data analysis in

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,490
general so I'm we we all know well I

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,120
suppose many of us will know what that

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,560
pythons origins came from a teaching

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,340
language in computer science and it's

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,200
actually 23 years old now so it's no

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,870
longer the new kid on the block it's um

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,970
it's and there being a steady stream of

00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,830
releases every one to two years and it's

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,799
been getting getting better and you'd

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,479
options increased so much that so that

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,790
by now Python is actually the most

00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:01,490
popular teaching language in u.s.

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:03,260
colleges and this was um from yeah an

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,360
article in the communication of the ACM

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,010
just this month okay so it's actually

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,769
overtaken Java is the most popular

00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:17,209
teaching language now okay so um so how

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:18,950
has Python grown like this so I think

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,370
there are a few factors

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:24,519
one is that it's readable so even

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,440
occasional programmers can grockit and

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,620
it's it's open source and portable

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,110
across many platforms and so on and one

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,700
of the factors for science and data

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,610
analysis in particular has been that

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,599
it's easy to create excuse me see

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,220
extensions and numpy is the most

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,650
well-known of those but there's a whole

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,620
ecosystem of science related and data

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,750
related see extensions that that extend

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,640
python from being a general-purpose

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,489
programming language one that's really

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,400
good for handling data analysis ok so

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:02,810
I'm and the syntax of the Python

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,090
language has been so it's been extended

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,489
in a few instances so for example over

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,560
loadable operators and and support for

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:11,209
multidimensional indexing which the

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,250
features that were requested by the

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,780
science and engineering and data

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,810
analysis communities and and guido and

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,700
the the core developers have have been

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,209
accommodating in allowing python to

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,280
expand to to become a a language that's

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:31,850
well suited at the syntactic level and

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,109
syntax is important this is a an article

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:40,959
from from 2007 it's an example of the

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:43,730
kind of um sort of push that pythons had

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:49,220
to yeah in the field of science and

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:52,549
engineering okay so numpy is the

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,019
foundation of a lot of scientific work

00:03:52,549 --> 00:04:01,130
in in in python and the origins of numpy

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:04,340
go back to sort of the mid-90s and that

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,799
this is from a keynote given by travis

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,459
olyphant who's the principal author of

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,739
numpy adam euro euro python which was

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:17,900
just on one or two weeks ago so so Syfy

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,729
had its origins around the turn of the

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,710
century it really um came together from

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,610
three people initially so Travis Olaf an

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,140
Erik Jones and and Peru Peterson

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,830
combining different tools into what was

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,230
really a distribution at the time

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,870
we didn't have package management tools

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,360
as good as we do now in Python so sigh

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,130
pi was our kind of distribution of lots

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,850
of packages which otherwise would have

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,440
been hard to stitch together and then

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,610
there's the fact that the communities

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,740
really been growing and and this is

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,570
showing the number of commits to to each

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,290
of these three projects numpy Saipan

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,850
matplotlib and interestingly it's sort

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,400
of this is um the advent of github so

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,780
and the collaborative development

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,050
opportunities that it makes possible

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,030
have really allowed these projects to

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,690
grow enormously and same with others as

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,090
well so so this is one factor the

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,310
communities yeah that sometimes things

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,880
can sort of come together like useful

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:26,760
tools that allow the community to really

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:31,050
take charge and really um contribute

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,540
massively to project so I suppose the

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,330
scientific Python ecosystem is is very

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,330
big and very broad and diverse and and

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,490
numpy in some sense it's of them at the

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,710
middle of it in that it's a transport

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,780
layer for data but yeah there are many

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,090
many tools and it's getting better all

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,060
the time so it's an exciting time to be

00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,600
involved in in Python for data analysis

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,290
and science and engineering and it's

00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,320
it's a yeah in some ways in quite a lot

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,440
of ways python is now leading away so

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,990
many languages have now have access to

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,180
the ipython notebook for example but it

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,160
came from Python it's some but it's been

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,670
expanding beyond that sort of changing

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,480
the definition of what people think of

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,870
as um as a sort of yeah the way to work

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,400
for any sort of scientific type problems

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,900
okay so yeah the ipython notebook is

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,260
really a game changer and that's only

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,270
really been around for perhaps what

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,760
about two two and a half years or so

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:38,250
since um since euro syfy 2012 i think it

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,870
was announced so yeah pretty pretty

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,790
recent as well but it's it's probably

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,580
something that many well most of you

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,180
have probably used Italy orly seen it

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,669
and

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,199
I'm sure you'll see a lot of it today so

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:54,690
in the talks we have today and and then

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,880
there's this um this survey which was

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,340
done recently so at the o'reilly strata

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,729
conference on different tools people

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:06,990
were using for data analysis so python

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:10,710
is is right up there it's behind behind

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,770
our on this some on this scale but above

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,080
above XL even at least among attendees

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,970
for this conference so it's interesting

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,620
to see that python has such a foothold

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,870
in in data analysis in general yeah so

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,599
um that's that's very interesting too

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,669
and this is rather new i'd say i suppose

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,580
the field of data science is rather than

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:38,639
you in a self but but python is um is

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:40,680
really leading away here and then we

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,949
have various areas that pythons growing

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,470
into so pythons already very very strong

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,349
in geospatial analysis and both with

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:52,710
proprietary commercial tools and

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:55,590
solutions and and open source packages

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,699
as well and python is really growing in

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:02,099
finance and economics the first talk we

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,510
have this morning from from arthur on um

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:08,780
on Monte Carlo simulation for business

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,000
business case analysis oh I think

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,800
something like that so on yeah that'll

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,690
be interesting and so I things been

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,099
growing in that field primarily because

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,870
of Crisa pandas but yeah it's it's

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:27,620
really growing this and big data in

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:41,339
general is um yeah pythons um really

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:43,620
really unhelpful oh which is a pretty

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,630
hard to do with proprietary languages

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,579
and where there's you know a license fee

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,410
might have to be paid for for each

00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:50,940
individual use of it whereas an in

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,970
Python because of the open-source nature

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,440
that's that's possible a lot more and

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,860
there are various other new fields that

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,360
python has um so is taking hold in which

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,540
and some of these fields didn't even

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,180
exist five five or ten years ago so

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,940
data-driven journalism is is a field

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,420
that is growing so it's a form of social

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,720
science in a way with the idea is that

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,880
the research into our into articles can

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,910
actually be made publicly available and

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,240
and subject to the same kind of peer

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,480
review as scientific papers and and um

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,790
so please coming and yeah political

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,670
science to and and economics are all

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,010
becoming more quantitative and and many

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,410
people of am working in those fields

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,170
aren't programmers and aren't computer

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,740
scientists and and they want a language

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,600
that's simple and easy to learn and and

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,850
Python fits that bill really well okay

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,730
so I think there are a lot of reasons to

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,610
be excited and and I'm looking forward

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,100
to today and to meeting many of you and

00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:00,630
um so yeah with that I'd like to

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,870
introduce the oven first speaker arthur

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,870
street
