	00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,410
and now on with the show our first

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,019
speaker our keynote speaker today is

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,299
Miss Katie Katie Katie Cunningham she's

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,830
formerly of NASA where she discovered

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,750
Django was involved in using Django at

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,839
NASA she is now with the Cox Media Group

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,089
and is also an author with books printed

00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,320
by both the Riley and the Pearson

00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,929
Pearson press and I think she's got a

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,310
couple others in the works coming down

00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,900
the pipeline she is here today to talk

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,279
about that experience of being an author

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,410
and the experience of getting

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,000
documentation out there and django has

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,590
always had a very strong tradition of

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,850
having good documentation but that

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,310
doesn't mean we go we can't improve and

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,840
we can't have more of it so without

00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,000
further ado I would like to invite to

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,000
the stage the real Cady Cady Cunningham

00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:16,500
hi I'm here to talk to you about how to

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,969
learn to love writing or how harry

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,110
potter fanfic will improve your

00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:24,329
documentation so Who am I as Russ said

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,920
my name is Katie Cunningham I'm a python

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,530
and django developer for a cox media

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,090
group in the United States I've also

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,939
written two books for O'Reilly and

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,159
Pearson because these two didn't

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,960
completely break my spirit i'm working

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,520
on my third book one that focuses on

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,670
kids and the people who teach them even

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,740
before i wrote those books i was turning

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,209
out quite a bit of tech writing when i

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,490
worked at NASA I was called the

00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,590
documentation fairy because one of my

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,780
tasks was to take whatever our group was

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,310
working on at the moment and generate

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,950
enough documentation to make the

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,319
government happy I got quite a bit of

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,420
practice at NASA because they really

00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:08,099
like documentation they wanted it by the

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:11,579
pound before that though I wrote fiction

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,860
no no I never published anything I never

00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,690
even sent out so much as a proposal but

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,190
it was something that entertained me and

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,420
it forced my brain to stretch into new

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,950
directions now in my day-to-day work I

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,269
spend quite a bit of time reading

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,930
various things the tech community

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,720
produces I read docs for modules that I

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,579
need to use I read technical books and

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,889
the languages that I want to learn I

00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:36,810
read blog post in hopes of solving a

00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,760
problem that i have i go to stack

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,769
overflow and try to figure out issues

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,139
that we're having with our like local

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,079
environment with all this reading I

00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:51,060
realized something people we really need

00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:53,250
to get better at writing so why bother

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,340
being good at writing we're not writers

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,680
for coders i've left mew than a few of

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,139
them sorry i've read more than a few

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,510
developers who insist that being able to

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,489
write well isn't important their career

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,169
I mean it's a waste of time isn't it

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,900
they could just be spending all that

00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,519
time coding isn't that a better of use

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,260
of all those valuable minutes they would

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,290
lose writing stuff well you can use the

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,080
same excuse when it comes to regular

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,090
bathing I mean why waste all that time

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,090
ending under a shower and dealing with

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,760
soap shampoo and like washing your

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,550
clothes and doing that you could spend

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,160
all that time coding I mean think about

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,020
how much more you would have at the end

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,900
of the week you would have liked hours

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,510
you would have saved I think we can all

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,190
agree that giving up hygiene does not

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,890
make the world a better place no matter

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:52,480
how much code you generate well the same

00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,790
applies to writing if you want your

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,220
projects to survive longer the newer

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,190
attention span you'd better document

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,440
them in spite of what someone once told

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,010
you elegant code is not all the

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,780
documentation you need I'm actually kind

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,540
of confused by people who talk about

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,330
this um I have this image of them

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,880
sitting in front of like a roaring fire

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,640
reading code like with a snifter of

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,400
brandy or something like ah this one is

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,020
from the RN que era sends like sends a

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,530
memory management since shivers down my

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:30,400
spine but here's a reality check none of

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,740
us like you that much we want a too long

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,870
didn't read and that is a big part of

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,280
what documentation is we don't want to

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,110
have to read your code to figure out

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,110
what the heck it does and how to use it

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,200
when you write poorly you communicate

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,720
poorly ever had a ticket where the

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,390
requirements were just like so unclear

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,610
you got headaches looking at it you

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,110
spend days and maybe even weeks going

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,520
back and forth so the owner of the

00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,470
ticket you know trying to figure out

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,480
what the heck they actually want and

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,370
they rewrite it it doesn't make sense

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,690
and you know and they do ask any

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,690
questions and they be read it again it

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,860
doesn't even answer your questions and

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,210
finally when you get out of them what

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,280
the meat of the problem is you think

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,070
well why the heck didn't just say that

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,830
in the first place if you don't practice

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:25,630
saying things clearly you won't be able

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:29,830
to say things clearly when it matters so

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,270
sorry my vocals got you what are the

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,290
reasons what are the reasons that you

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,020
were going what are the reasons you're

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,520
going to want to be able to write well

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,760
is that at some point you're going to

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,470
want to have to sell something you have

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,500
unless you are gifted with a vast amount

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,120
of money at birth chances are at some

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,610
point you're going to need to convince

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:54,010
somebody else to give you cash you might

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,560
have an idea you want to sell ever had

00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,300
somebody tried to like you know they try

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,010
to tell you about this awesome idea they

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,560
have and they go on and on forever and

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,480
then you're just kind of like I have no

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,860
idea where you're coming from and you

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,030
think maybe they're kind of a little bit

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,500
crazy chances are they're not crazy they

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,970
just don't have practice communicating

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,220
clearly if you're not an idea prob if

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,900
you're not an idea person you probably

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,360
still have to sell something that you

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,970
have maybe it's something that you make

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,560
like your company actually makes some

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,450
kind of API you want other people to

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,980
consume and you've been sent to a

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,510
conference to try to convince people to

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,010
use it maybe you've gone to a conference

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,890
try to convince people to work for your

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,050
company you may even just have like an

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,190
apt it's super convenient for you but

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,630
it's not going to be convenient to all

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,150
your friends use it so you have to

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,890
convince them to use it well I've lost

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,600
count of the number of times somebody

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,180
has tried to sell me on like an app like

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,650
bump when bump was the thing you know

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,390
and they're like it's the graton to go

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,160
all over it and I'm just like why are

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,350
you so excited about this stupid app

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,320
well they can't communicate communicate

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,660
clearly why they're so excited they can

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,670
just show me but like gesticulation that

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,540
they're super excited even if you have

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:13,780
no products and no ideas one day you

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,880
have to sell yourself trust me resume

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,890
writing is a whole lot easier once

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,990
you've written some fiction because it's

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:25,720
basically like fanfic about yourself so

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,000
if writing helps us out so much why

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,200
aren't we doing it more why do we still

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,200
suck at it now I won't lie writing takes

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,990
time the first time I wrote something

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,940
long-form I would sit down and I would

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,260
write and write

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,580
and write and write the Sun would move

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,840
across the sky and the shadows move

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,820
across the floor and I would just keep

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,370
writing and then I would save and i did

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,710
a word count I'd have like 250 words and

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,500
I would scream at my word processor

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,560
because I swore I'd ridden at least like

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,140
five thousand words but it takes so much

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,910
time that sometimes it can feel like

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:04,590
this is a complete waste of my time

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:07,070
because I've gotten nowhere it's also

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,180
kinda boring when you're starting off

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,010
when you're drying technical stuff

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,290
there's a good chance you're not like

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,360
you know gonna have a ton of fun I mean

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,770
I do this for real money like people

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,120
give me money to do technical

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,830
documentation in to write books and

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,080
stuff and I'm not sitting there like

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,120
giggling and laughing and you know you

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,980
know totally joyous the entire time i

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,150
mean if i did my probably my family

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:34,680
would probably worried about me like

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:36,240
more it's also very frustrating have you

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,270
ever had the angst of looking at like a

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,969
blank page or blank email knowing you

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,970
have to write something it's important

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,400
you have to write a thing but you have

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,430
no idea what to actually write nothing

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,980
comes to you I've got like empty bottles

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:57,870
of bourbon that show how much I know

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,160
that pain so and what about writing

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,510
something where you think you're like

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,740
totally clear you write an email and

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,020
you're like cool everybody will

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,840
understand this and the sudden war

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,030
breaks out because nobody understood

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,130
what you were talking about and you keep

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,570
trying to fix like no no i meant i met

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,280
and they're like well that word doesn't

00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,750
mean that and you just have this

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,030
horrible like you want to crawl under

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,590
your desk and die because everybody

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,390
seems to be reading something different

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,310
from what you actually wrote it's

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:30,510
probably not their comprehension it's

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:32,580
probably your writing sorry so what does

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,980
something like fate fiction have to do

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,650
with writing as a developer well

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,960
everything for those that don't know

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,900
fanfic which is short for fanfiction is

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,210
a story that's written by a fan of a

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,120
certain like show or movie or book or

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,980
gay or whatever some kind of media they

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,110
use the universe and the characters of

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,570
the original authors but play out

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,910
original

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,400
stories possibly even creating new

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,900
characters so a fanfic author might

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,970
insert themselves into the Harry Potter

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,620
universe or write a story from the

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,820
perspective of the trance and Lord of

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,320
the Rings I personally would love a

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,630
story about what happened to the ant

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,520
wives sorry about all the texts I just

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,580
thought this was really funny you can

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,480
read it later I'll half the slide set so

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:22,840
again why bother why think stuff like

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,640
fanfic is generally fun low risk and it

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,280
will help you get writing and you it

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,840
will help you at writing in your day job

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,700
I mean I know I know you could spend

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,860
hours and hours writing technical stuff

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,740
like blogs and documentation and

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,840
proposals and copy for your website if

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,150
that kind of thing gets your juices

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,500
flowing don't let me stop you I mean

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,960
some people love writing that kind of

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,660
stuff but if you don't and you still

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,810
need practice writing then this is a

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,700
really great way to get started it's

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,310
really low risk your career is not

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,350
writing on it nobody even ever has to

00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:03,910
see it and it's just something fun to do

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:06,310
for yourself so you might as well do

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,320
something fun because if you wait and

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,910
until you have to write something

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,790
professionally in your careers on the

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,770
line you cannot just throw words up on

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,650
the screen and hope that they'll make

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,450
sense because they won't just like you

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,910
need to practice coding you need to

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:27,040
practice writing so what are the tools

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,240
of the author because one of the great

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
things about learning to write like

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,040
writing fanfic and silly stuff like this

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,450
the tools you use here as a fanfic

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,940
author are the same tools you used as a

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,290
technical writer so what are some of

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,830
these tools well it's not just a laptop

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:45,700
and a lot of coffee the first thing is

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,520
speed an experienced author writes

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,080
faster and I'm not talking about how

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,990
fast their fingers move across a

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,610
keyboard I've been writing for many

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,110
years now and I don't think that my

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,930
words per minute has increased

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,360
significantly since college what has

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,150
changed is how many of those words are

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,070
good words the first time I wrote

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:10,060
something long form I ended up throwing

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,340
literally half the book like 25,000

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,770
words that i had spent days weeks even

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,800
like you know cranking on and you know

00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,720
crying over and figuring out and I threw

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,670
them away and that wasn't even the end

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,070
of it I toss that whole scenes I tossed

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,600
out hold plots characters I completely

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,430
stripped the story down to it was

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,700
practically just a short story at that

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,890
point but that's the life at the

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,420
beginning writer I didn't have the habit

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,930
of picking the right words from the

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,250
get-go I was inexperienced so I spent

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,930
too long when scenes to work going

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,120
anywhere i added in characters because

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,340
it didn't know what to do it just you

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,290
know i had a lot of like bad habits that

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,610
over time i got you know rid of because

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,820
i got really tired of throwing out half

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,730
the book um over time i did find that i

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,190
was cutting out less sure I mean I might

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,110
move something around or color dialog or

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:04,120
remove a scene but I wasn't like

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:06,730
deleting half the book in technical

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,220
writing if you have practice writing

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,710
higher quality text then you end up

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,630
spending less time reading over your

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,790
dachshund yanking out the weak sections

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,310
you're also able to see what the week

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,220
sections are you won't waste time

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,500
writing and rewriting a very important

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,970
email you won't waste your co-workers

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,380
time pulling them over and saying oh my

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,910
god can you read this before i send it

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,890
because i have absolutely no confidence

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,820
in my abilities but one word after the

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:37,470
other the ability picked the right words

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,480
transfers really well between mediums

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,640
check out the non-fiction books put out

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,370
by fiction authors Stephen King's on

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,160
writing is considered a classic amongst

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,620
many writers king did not spend years

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,750
relearning how to write like nonfiction

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,500
since he'd be providing fiction all this

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,510
time he already knew how to be coherent

00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,920
I mean this actually surprised me

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,840
wouldn't happen to me the first time I

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,480
was asked to create that technical

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,760
documentation at NASA I was terrified

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,410
I'm like I am completely out of my depth

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,600
I have done nothing but right stupid

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:15,670
backstories for my dandy characters and

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,620
this is not my bag but it was it was

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,340
kind of amazing I was actually faster

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,410
than most of the people who

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,060
their full-time job to do this and this

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,680
is just a task they put me on because

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,590
they couldn't there was no money in the

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,150
bucket to get one of them I had the

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,860
fewest Corrections and I actually had

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,900
the happiest customers I mean they

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,580
actually read my documentation which is

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,140
huge compliment because normally at NASA

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,400
they just weigh it and if it's heavy

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:43,490
enough then you get to deploy your

00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:46,490
website another tool is organization

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:49,520
when you write you have to be organized

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,920
the songwriters are externally organized

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,210
writing huge outlines and creating

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,370
character summaries for everyone in

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,010
their story I mean he'll summaries I

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,110
know people who create dossiers like FBI

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,660
dossiers do you have an FBI kind of

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,860
thing here not you oh okay you know who

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,390
it is you know Dana is status Scully

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,860
they have like dossiers on each of their

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,750
characters like you know who their best

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,970
friend was and where they went to school

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,650
and all their heart breaks and window

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,870
and they stole candy from a store when

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,730
they were eight that kind of stuff in

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,230
the poor of a material that exists for

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,520
the world and you'll take notes about

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,230
when they can use something when they

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,010
can stick their story and what they can

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,870
reference oh when I was writing amber

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,170
fanfic I don't know if anybody knows

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,710
amber by Roger Zelazny my original

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,660
characters had like huge dossiers I only

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,310
knew who like their parents were I knew

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,740
how they were raised but their hobbies

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,600
were who their first love was the major

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,450
heartbreaks and victories of you that

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,880
kind of stuff and I may have even like

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,070
created a database for this kind of

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:58,880
thing like with a really nice API and a

00:15:52,070 --> 00:16:01,760
web interface I'm a nerd so anyway

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,350
writers are crazy organized even those

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,790
even those that do something called

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,950
discovery writing where they just kind

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,140
of sit down and start writing have

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,610
internal organization if you talk to

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,530
ones that do this they actually have

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,930
like everything in their head they just

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,610
haven't written down the outline so

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,990
that's what's happening is they've pre

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,020
organized in their head they're able to

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,460
just write and they keep track of where

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,350
things are and they can move things

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,460
around they don't throw away half their

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,200
book so what does this have to do with

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,880
technical writing well learning to

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,190
outline well makes her life so much

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,230
easier whenever I start a new technical

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,660
document whether it's a bit of docs for

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,820
a new project or a book I start with an

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,800
outline it's something we all learned

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,570
when we were kids and we just kind of

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,280
grew up and decided we didn't need it

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,320
anymore well it's one of those tools you

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,030
should have kept that you should

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,500
remember how to outline things I mean

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,990
first of all it takes pressure off your

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,400
brain when you're writing if you're not

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,690
sure what to write next you just pull up

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,340
your outline you like okay well I guess

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,020
I'm writing that next and you just start

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,459
writing it if you don't feel like

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,930
writing that thing right now you're like

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,160
good but something else I feel like

00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,470
writing I'll write that thing and you

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,420
write that thing instead you can also

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,339
look forward and say okay when do I need

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,470
to cover this thing okay haven't covered

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,980
this it's covered later so I need two

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,230
nite not talk about that second it helps

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,980
you avoid issues down the line when I

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,750
was writing Python in 24 hours my editor

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,970
had me write up this outline and she

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,490
handed it over to another author he

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,440
pointed out major issues and we were

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,090
able to fix it with like no effort I

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
hadn't written the book at this point

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,320
had I written the book it would have

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,970
been a completely rewrite of the first

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,800
third of the book but because of that

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,060
all it was was swapping a couple of bits

00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,670
around and I'm saying yeah that looks

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:51,390
much better and it saved me probably

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:53,430
months of effort now outside of

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,260
outlining organizing your information

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,060
and research is incredibly important

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,040
when you do technical writing when I'm

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,780
starting at a new book I keep an

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,720
organized list of resources for the

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,640
things that I'm not like an expert on 24

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,860
hours had a chapter on flask which at

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,060
the time I hadn't really used but I knew

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,730
it was something that I could cover in

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,440
an hour so I had a bunch of resources

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,030
that I would go back to and double check

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,340
and cross check to make sure that I was

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:22,230
doing something correctly and in a flask

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:25,020
e-way clarity is another skill that

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,490
comes only with practice none of us are

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,290
born with it if you don't believe me

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,970
like listen to a Fourier will try to

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,200
tell a story of like what happened at a

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,760
movie and you're going to have an

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,050
aneurysm because it's going to make no

00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,760
sense we are not born being clear even

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,080
beginning you know every beginning

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,850
writer has a story in their arsenal

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,650
where they just kind of gallop through

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,180
the story I mean they want to get to the

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,440
exciting part so who wants to talk about

00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,269
boring stuff like setting

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,669
motivation back story let's just get to

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:54,559
the juicy bits this happens quite a bit

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,559
if the story happens to have sex in it

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:03,299
anyway the story suffers because you're

00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:05,730
moving too fast and just focusing on the

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,940
stuff that's fun to write this costs you

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,970
clarity no one is quite sure why they're

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,500
watching Snape kiss Ron it's confusing

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,379
and off-putting because you didn't take

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,720
the time to set the scene experienced

00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:20,399
writers know you have to build up to the

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,070
juicy bits you actually learned to like

00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,570
it you spend time crafting scenes that

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,220
will help put the reader in the right

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,139
state of mind so they can fully

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:34,019
anticipate the carnal buffet you're

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:38,850
about to lay before them am I going to

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:40,649
get a call from credit conduct sorry so

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,519
there's not any sex scenes in doc's

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:46,769
usually however there are juicy bits

00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,629
most of us rush to the end goal when

00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,279
trying to explain something just like

00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,840
run pip install and bam you're done and

00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,159
that's like I've actually run across

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
documentation they're just like pip

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,200
install and you're good how do you

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,009
expect anything more we leave out things

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,080
like examples we avoid caveats we also

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,940
avoid any system we're not intimately

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,759
familiar with people who never touch

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:13,529
anything besides like Ubuntu or Mac we

00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,179
just don't we just want to talk about

00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:17,610
the cool things that our module can do

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,860
when I read other people's docs I often

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,230
joke they leave out steps 1 3 5 & 8

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,389
they'll skip out like vitals setup

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,429
instructions because everyone knows how

00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,320
to do that right they'll leave out

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,230
system requirements because it should be

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,029
obvious according to them they leave out

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,080
steps that you know it becomes second

00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:36,960
nature to them so they don't really

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,029
think about them or fail to mention that

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,610
yeah they've only tested this test at

00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:44,720
this against python 2.6 so maybe this

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,580
won't work under Python 2.7 an

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,250
experienced writer knows to slow down

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,899
their practiced in it they've learned to

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,419
take a breath and read over what they've

00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:57,059
written in fact the more experienced a

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,100
writer is the more they actually can

00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,620
keep what they've written inside their

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,180
head

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,610
so it's kind of like the book is live in

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,710
the back of your head so you've no like

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,540
that past several pages what you've like

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,670
talked about so you can keep a thread

00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:15,130
going perspective is another thing that

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:18,190
comes up in writing with stories

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,230
perspective is vital let's say someone

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:23,350
is writing a fanfic about a typical day

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,290
on boards Darcy Starship Enterprise who

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:29,080
we follow and how we follow them changes

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,690
the story drastically we could follow a

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,880
nameless red shirt as he observes the

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,280
captain and his crew and learnt in their

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,140
interactions we might be deep inside of

00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,820
his head while he's thinking about like

00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,480
how Kirk is actually kind of a jerk and

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,070
Spock would be so much better a captain

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,929
we might just observe his actions and

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,240
slowly realize that he's setting up some

00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,860
kind of like sabotage event we might

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,480
take the perspective of Kirk as he

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,520
launches this new red shirt make his

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,900
rounds or Spock as he realized that

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,380
something is not quite right with this

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:02,020
dude we might have all of these

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,929
perspectives actually carefully arranged

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,309
to best ramp up tension novice riders

00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,050
freaked out about perspective because

00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,510
you need to know what perspective you're

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,890
using before you even start writing they

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,679
usually just think of it as a choice

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,330
between first person and third so I went

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,780
and open the door or Jim went and opened

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,120
the door um it's really much more subtle

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,070
than that experienced riders know the

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,710
perspective as a way to manipulate the

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,320
reader in to feeling and knowing exactly

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,510
what you want when you want it for the

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,270
biggest impact Agatha Christie is an

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,429
expert at this making sure you only find

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,220
out vital information when it will have

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,870
its fullest impact on you she does this

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,020
by tightly controlling whose perspective

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,360
she is showing off any one time and then

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,370
there were one is a really good example

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,520
of this if you ever want like a case

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,800
study in perspective in technical

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,710
writing you have to consider perspective

00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,360
as well rather than revealing bombs of

00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,340
murder weapons though you're revealing

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,200
information when you consider

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,600
perspective and technical writing you

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,790
have to think of your audience

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,490
constantly what do they know coming into

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:12,220
this are they novices are you okay with

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,330
assuming they're not a novice do they

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,070
already have like sir

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,320
things set up that you are positive of

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,880
is it internal to the company that you

00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,230
need to point off other things you know

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,290
are they a new person who knows where

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:26,320
none of this stuff is do they even know

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:27,670
python you know do they know how to

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,130
setup a server do they know how to

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,750
properly add an app to django that kind

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,520
of stuff so that is how you know you

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,190
need to consider where they're coming

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,050
from and as you write you have to keep

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,640
checking yourself you really want to

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,930
create an example that shows off one

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,140
part of your module but have you

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,240
explained it yet you're using an engine

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,230
X set up have you made that clear have

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
you made it clear you're not using a

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,740
patching this doesn't work with Apache

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,370
or you have no intention of testing it

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,020
with Apache are you tossing too much

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,280
information at the user at once which is

00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,950
actually where a lot of documentation

00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,690
fails it just throws too much or the

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,430
other mistake it makes is it doesn't

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,980
call to attention things that are

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,720
important by isolating them by saying

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,610
you know making sure it's one sentence

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,790
and you're like hey this is important

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,930
does not work in python 2.6 because

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:20,170
there's a lot of people still running on

00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:23,140
to python 2.6 so what are some of the

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,960
resources most adults who get into

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,670
writing don't just dive in right away I

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,460
mean most adults you decide they want to

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,870
do like anything don't start it's only

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,250
kids that do that kids are like I'm

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,860
going to be a fireman i'm going to get a

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,800
hose and like start a fire and figure

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,660
that out most adults like i really want

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,370
to get into woodworking yeah i'm going

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,610
to read wikipedia for the next you know

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,020
three years and figure all that out

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,610
because if there's anything that celts

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,740
are really good at its procrastinating

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,590
and also writers are expert

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,650
procrastinators so we have lots of

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,600
places for you to go for help even if

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,880
you decide that you don't want to write

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,710
anything but emails and texts docs and

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,780
block those proposals and all that kind

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,070
of stuff that doesn't mean you can't

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,710
take advantage of some of the stuff

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,580
that's been put out there for writers

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:13,600
there are actually a couple of really

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,330
good podcasts you can listen to writing

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,660
excuses is one of my favorite podcasts

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,220
it is geared toward genre writers but

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,200
they have a lot of useful things for

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,900
anyone I actually use a lot of their

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,190
tips in my technical writing first

00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,380
they're just fun to listen to

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,740
they have a very nice like banter II

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,050
kind of group a second as they say

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,030
they're only 15 minutes long so you're

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,710
not sitting there for an hour you know

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,840
getting really bored after the first 20

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,720
minutes and they do get to the point and

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,490
they always have useful takeaways most

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,280
importantly they talk about things like

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,770
structure and organization and writing

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,150
set up and writers block which you can

00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,030
still get with technical writing Oh

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,130
trust me these are things that affect

00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:01,870
tike tech writers and fiction writers

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:04,300
alike I'd rather be writing is actually

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,750
a technical podcast a technical tech

00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,710
writing podcast it's not as fun as the

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,020
one where they're talking about like

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,480
dragons and magic systems and stuff but

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,690
it's still very good they cover things

00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,430
like documenting api's styles for

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,270
including code samples how to write

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,800
examples pacing that kind of stuff and

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,350
they also cover stuff like blogging I

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,140
highly recommend giving their beginner

00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,850
tips on their website a good read even

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,560
if you don't really consider yourself a

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:38,500
beginner there's also no shortage of

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,000
books telling you how to write one of

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,950
them that the favorite acts of like the

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,990
cross donation that we writers have is

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,880
reading yet another book on how to write

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,650
I think I wrote read like 10 different

00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,260
books before I finally set it as I

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,730
actually have to write something now

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,230
because it does not make you a writer to

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,890
read books about writing it just makes

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,360
you well read I recommend reading like

00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,770
one or two just don't try to read all of

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,290
them and I'm only going to give you like

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,480
a couple examples here this is one of my

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,920
favorite ones fiction first aid it's a

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,650
little hard to find sometimes but you

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,900
can track it down I love it because it

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,670
shows bad samples of writing and you

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,490
actually start reading it and thank God

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,710
I'm not that bad you know so either hope

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,960
for me but it shows bad samples of

00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,830
writing but also goes back and shows the

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,180
advice that this he's actually a teacher

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,040
gave the student and how the student

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,650
fixed it which was it's great because

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,540
you can see how bad turns to good and

00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,240
how to fix common mistakes and common

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,410
issues you have like word choice pacing

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,150
different perspective that kind of stuff

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,080
and I think that it just drives a lot of

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,830
the lessons that worked

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,390
will constantly home a bit better

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,480
there's also the right great fiction

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,070
series which has a book for pretty much

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,630
anything you'd ever need to cover from

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:58,020
plot setting to dialogue to editing you

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,220
know it has a book on everything so

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,030
beyond reading books about writing

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,590
though it's very important to just read

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,420
I think that many people need to read

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,130
more and not just read blog posts not

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,220
just read your RSS feeds not just read

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,620
magazines read long form because

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,940
long-form is where you get a lot of

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,170
these like understanding the craft and

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,540
especially blog posts are not often

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,640
freshly produced and you don't even need

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,500
to read like literary fiction you know

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,420
read that if you want to read that and

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,790
that's your thing but you can learn a

00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,980
lot just reading genre fiction I mean I

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,210
learned everything I learned so much

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,290
just reading Agatha Christie an

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,760
understanding perspective I mean if you

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,560
want to read about space wizards and

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,410
paranormal detectives and over-the-top

00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:49,810
stuff you know that's good it'll get

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:51,730
your mind going MIT also has a free

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,220
writing workshop that you can take

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,630
online the readings are really light

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,520
I've actually I'd read them all before

00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,500
and they're not heavy you know it's MIT

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,090
but these are really you know these are

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,010
high school level readings you can get

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,450
through them and the assignments are you

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,250
know the sum of our personal essay is

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,010
nonfiction writing and some micro

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,540
fiction also the great thing is since

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:13,360
you're not actually turning any of this

00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,680
into MIT you can like go ahead and like

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,210
write that for splash track that you've

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,980
been wanting to do another really

00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,400
important resource if you want to write

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,650
as other people they can help you grow

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,170
as a writer because they can call you

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:31,270
out when you're being lazy or self

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,590
indulgent when you're like I don't need

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,970
to explain that that's fine the reader

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,230
will figure out and don't love the fact

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,510
they figured it out no they don't

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,900
there's very rare cases where readers

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,220
like figuring stuff out you know like

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,590
mystery novels but for the most part

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,440
readers do want information they don't

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,050
want to feel uncertain many areas have

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,150
writers groups you can check to see if

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,610
anybody's hosting one regular basis you

00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,909
can go to coffee shops bookstores that

00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,909
kind of

00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:59,889
stuff google also helps in this regard

00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,690
but I will warn you for some reason like

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:04,149
writers groups are super bad about

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,190
creating a web presence I don't know

00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:10,539
apparently they need us as much as we

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,830
need them if you can't find any in the

00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:14,470
real world there's also a bunch of ones

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,729
that you can join online you just need

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,830
to make sure that they actually are

00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:19,599
writing something you want to read don't

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,249
join a historical fiction group if you

00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,200
want to like actually read science

00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:24,909
fiction and write that you can also find

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,799
ones that do technical writing although

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:29,499
those are a bit rare and usually very

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,059
focused a lot of Java ones for some

00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:32,590
reason and they're probably they don't

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:37,570
like us never met John people who

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:40,299
actually like Python people another

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,009
thing you can do is your company you

00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,629
know talk to like the people at your

00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,820
company and say maybe one like every

00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:47,349
other week we can get together and we

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,359
can write technical docs and review them

00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:51,399
with each other you know in a open

00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,369
environment friendly environment go over

00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,619
all the stuff you know because I can't

00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:58,720
think of any company that thinks are I

00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:01,299
wish our stack was just a little less

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,460
well documented and you know what we

00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,049
have is so clear it's it's horrible you

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,119
know this is an advantage for your

00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:09,759
company to actually have well written

00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,080
documentation trust me i'm from a

00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,539
company where we're suffering from that

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,979
it's costing us money to on on board

00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,749
people because one person has to

00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:18,549
literally quit their job for a week to

00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:23,470
onboard people because we have no

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:25,450
documentation sorry boss but it's true

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,679
you know it cost us a lot of money it

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,119
would have saved us a lot of money if we

00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:33,220
had really simple onboarding docs so

00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,320
that's all I have today I spoke quickly

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,379
but probably we're running late so that

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:46,229
works out does anybody have any

00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:46,229
questions oh oh I have a mic

00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:56,360
alright if you have a question of today

00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:57,950
we get them no um so I'd be interested

00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,749
in knowing how you put this talk

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,240
together and what kind of techniques to

00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:03,950
use from writing preparation that work

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,309
well for talk preparation as well I

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,749
actually have kind of a weird method

00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,230
i'll put down a few ideas and then i'll

00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:14,360
talk to myself for a few weeks happily I

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,909
work from home so it's just me and my

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,909
dog during the day so I walk around and

00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:21,289
talk and pace and record myself and the

00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:23,869
dog just kind of sits in his bed and

00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,129
looks at me like I'm nuts but most of it

00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:26,869
is verbal but as like help with good

00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:30,289
ideas I write it down and I create an

00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:32,480
outline and slowly and actually at some

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,549
point i created the outline and then

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,350
started filling in all the chunks of

00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:38,240
text that i wanted to put in and all the

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,649
things i wanted to hit it's a very

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,749
iterative thing that i go over like

00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:45,070
several weeks back and forth and then

00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:45,070
I'm like oh I need to create slides

00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,409
hi have you ever done nanowrimo the

00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,240
National Novel Writing Month and do you

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:01,250
think it's a good thing to do it's so

00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,110
good I did so glad you mentioned that i

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,140
forgot it i had a note to myself to add

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,850
it and I was like oh damn it yes

00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,570
nanowrimo is great let me explain what

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:13,340
nanowrimo is nanowrimo is a thing we're

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,600
book which is really nabela but you know

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,600
if you can get 50,000 words out it's

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,240
great you start on November first you

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,679
cannot write anything before that you

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,049
started November first and you write

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:36,230
until the 30th that's 160 sits 1667

00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:38,150
words per day you need to write you need

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,230
to up it to like 2,000 if you're

00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,210
American you want to take like

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,100
Thanksgiving off or if you need to do

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,270
anything during november i don't know

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:49,580
what you'll have in november so but it's

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,380
a great thing you can join groups where

00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,850
you read each other stuff it's basically

00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,860
a way to get a lot of crap out of your

00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,890
system because remember writing his

00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,230
practice and even though I've done mine

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:02,390
remember like four or five years and the

00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:05,270
first time I did it it was so bad it was

00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,740
so horrible the next year was okay you

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,240
know but every year I got better and

00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,310
even though I never did anything with

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,830
those novels but put them in you know a

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:17,419
folder that I password protected from

00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:18,379
anybody that it's like okay I I was

00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:20,119
learning tricks and I was actually

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:23,599
getting better and the stories were more

00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,200
coherent so I do love nanowrimo and I do

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,200
participate

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,679
how general do you think people should

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,860
pitch say if you're writing am any kind

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,990
of technical documentation what's the if

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,639
you generalize on a target audience do

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,020
you think you should is there a certain

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,040
age at which you should try and I

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,090
recommend everybody right tech from a

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,740
technical documentation at 12 year olds

00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,450
whichever ones like uh but you have to

00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,930
understand when we talk about grade

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:05,119
level and like the u.s. we talk about a

00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,970
sixth grade level that is only because

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,830
if you have an adult reading that they

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,630
can read it very quickly and they get

00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,480
information very quickly because and

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,130
they can get information very quickly

00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,869
because the point is not to use big

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,130
fancy words to show like how smart you

00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:22,940
are and like your word a day calendar

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,590
was so totally worth it the point is to

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,420
get information to the person's head and

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,640
if you're talking to an adult at that

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,500
level that gets information really

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,930
quickly which is by the way but most

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:36,190
newspapers are written that at a sixth

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:39,470
grade level do you call it sixth grade

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:41,690
it's so yeah so but newspapers are at

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,970
that level for a reason they want you to

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,490
consume the information quickly not go

00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,230
crap what is that word you know because

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,570
there is more important things than that

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:54,830
cool word or long sentence structure or

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,990
you know complex you know you know

00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:00,460
complex structure of like how you would

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,460
create the story

00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:15,080
it likes of you do you have any

00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,940
recommendations on but resources for

00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,320
learning about layout because I've just

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,950
fine it's important but it's hard to

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,000
find good resources that layout like

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:28,130
laying out a book just laying out on a

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,320
like if for example if you go through

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,900
the head first manuals they're really

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,630
heavy on their images and very low level

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,350
but I mean it's hard to find where I do

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,820
people do that I'll be honest well

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,800
actually they're like no you're a you're

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,780
a writer we've seen what you try reach

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,810
what you tried to do with word no they

00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,100
whenever I write a book a layout person

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,920
actually does it so it's not something

00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,510
I'm experienced in I'm always amazed

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,830
when they come back I'm like holy crap

00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:00,620
it looks like a book and they're like

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:03,140
well yeah it's our job you know that and

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,370
I don't know and I don't know if any of

00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,930
them that blog either because i know

00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,610
several people that do it but i don't

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,820
think they really have like a presence

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:13,400
in the community your best bet might be

00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,720
looking for something in graphic design

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,580
because that's where a lot of people

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:22,640
come from that's their school probably

00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,980
not allowed answer to this question the

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,020
elements of typographic style by robert

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,000
bringhurst has a good section on page

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,440
layouts how much you want in your

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,240
margins that kind of things got some

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,180
really interesting examples such as the

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,150
Dead Sea Scrolls the Gutenberg Bible you

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,400
know Oxford English Dictionary fantastic

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,450
book really really interesting there you

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,590
go that's why need other people when

00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:47,680
you're right because they know more than

00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,680
you but I never do layouts

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,369
okay my question what tools you used to

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,910
write when you actually type it in these

00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:08,450
days I am writing in a ski dock which is

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,580
a version of rst restructure text that

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,190
is it's actually nice but you can just

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:16,280
use restructure text the reason I use a

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,290
ski doc is because the company i'm

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,700
writing for o'reilly they have a new

00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,240
system called atlas where you can just

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,440
use like right now ski doc get push it

00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,500
up to their server and then they'll

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,930
build it automatically so that's why i'm

00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,690
using that on my own i prefer things

00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:35,720
like rst ask you doc whatever is

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:39,980
available if you're working with a

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,080
publisher use their tool i learned this

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,970
the hard way i tried to use my own like

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,470
I'm gonna use doc book because it was

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,290
like yeah this would be great you know

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,810
i'm going to use everybody uses this and

00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:53,000
the conversion was painful between the

00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,500
two so if you actually want to write a

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,410
book the first question to your

00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,440
publisher should be yes so like what

00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:02,990
what do you write in and they'll give

00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,450
you a bunch of options you may be forced

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,550
to work in word but often it's used it's

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,859
worth it to kind of go through that pain

00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,240
to not go through the pain later because

00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,670
it took me three months to convert a

00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,280
bunch of stuff that i had written and it

00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,200
hurt you mean converting from ask you

00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,480
talk to her door from work that was from

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,430
docbook to word because it didn't like

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,280
they wanted their template and it was

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,750
munching up their system and you know

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,580
they weren't going to pay somebody to go

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,599
and fix my stuff so i had to go and fix

00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:35,020
it myself so I like SQ doc good choice

00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:35,020
yeah

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:50,660
any other questions oh it sounds like a

00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:53,390
silly question but how do you know how

00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:59,680
deep to go how do you know when to stop

00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:03,200
and and to fill out something else um I

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,210
tend to be a skimming author I when I

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,490
write I will write like the first level

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,780
and then i will start like diving down a

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,980
little bit deeper I'll go back and I'll

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,680
rewrite and meld I've done a little bit

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,060
deeper generally I look at how long I've

00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,580
been talking about something because I

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,280
actually render it to pages like actual

00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:24,470
physical pages and the reason I do this

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,840
because 250 words per page is meaningful

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,190
to the human brain that that's you know

00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,540
when that's how much information they're

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,630
taking it if I've been talking about

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,670
like string functions for 10 pages and

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,800
like how strings work we have gone way

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,310
too deep on strings I don't need to go

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,200
any deeper I need to break this down you

00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,090
know take a break you know let the

00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,590
person like ingest some information for

00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,330
a while because I have a feeling they're

00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,580
just going to start skimming after a few

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,560
pages and after you've written a bunch

00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,300
you start to get a feel for that because

00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,460
you do start to take on the mind of the

00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,960
reader and so you read something one

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,210
thing I recommend doing is reading aloud

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,920
like write out what you've written and

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,260
walk around and read it you will hear

00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,210
where it is awkward when you're going

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,320
through there you know all of a sudden

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,930
you're like oh that is awkward because

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,810
what it's awkward and your mouth it's

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,119
awkward on the page but we forgive

00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,600
ourselves when we're not forced for that

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,100
to do that to actually read it out loud

00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,140
or you could have it read to you if you

00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,910
know how to use screen readers or any

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,980
kind of like Mac speak kind of thing

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,680
have it read to you and you will hear

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,820
the awkward bits all of a sudden but

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,380
when you start reading you're like oh

00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,750
I'm reading but I've been talking about

00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,359
these stupid you know like strings of

00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:39,100
this Jango function for like an hour I'm

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,100
done you've probably gone too deep

00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,460
okay so you've addressed the authoring

00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,930
side of things the writing huge volumes

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,820
of stuff is great but unless you're

00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,530
actually getting the feedback on why you

00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,180
suck it's difficult to get the

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,560
improvement obviously you can self at it

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,960
and so for it when you improve through

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,340
usage but how do you find good editing

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,530
resources especially when it comes to

00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,180
technical stuff there the fiction stuff

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,650
is not so hard because some people do

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,970
actually want to read incredibly bad

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,800
fanfiction I willing to put up with a

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,270
lot but not many people are willing to

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,760
put up with bad technical documentation

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:21,470
for amusement value I saw your works

00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:23,290
liquor okay you also make friends with

00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,580
other people who do technical writing
