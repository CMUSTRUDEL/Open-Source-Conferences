00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,560
biggest issue we have as a django

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,420
community in australia at the moment is

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,090
that the people who are leading local

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,270
groups don't know who each other are so

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,230
if you are a local leadership person in

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,130

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,600
now I survived but it's an always an

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,580

they actually saved money on food

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,479
