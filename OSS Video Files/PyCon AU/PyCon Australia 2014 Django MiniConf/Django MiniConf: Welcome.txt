00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,869
have we have a formal dinner tomorrow

00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,910
night but the tonight we have ice

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,849
breaker dinners the plaque on organisers

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,800
have arranged for bookings for 10 at a

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,810
whole bunch of local restaurants if you

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,840
jump onto the

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,760
ticon-a you dot org website there is a

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,890
link on the homepage of the website to a

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,900
wiki which lists all the restaurants and

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,310
lists the people who are taking up those

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,230
bookings so if you are interested in

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,569
going out to a restaurant we have tables

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,610
booked if you can log on to the wiki and

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,069
put your name next to that next to a

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,300
particular restaurant before midday

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,380
because obviously when midday comes

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,880
we're going to have to cancel the

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,640
bookings that don't have enough people

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,160
or don't have any people associated with

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,450
them if you're not of your name isn't on

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,310
that wiki essentially you are fending

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,690
for yourself this evening again there

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,590
are plenty of good restaurants around we

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,480
just happen to have a couple with

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,989

please again come and see me either

here and we'll get you a slot into that

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:59,470
program lastly t-shirts don't know if

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,850
you saw last year t-shirts this is a

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,109
mini conference event and it wouldn't

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,730
have happened at all if it wasn't for

00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,560
the the plaque run organizers Chris

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,120
Neugebauer in particular last year

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,889
started up this mini conf program so

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,049
that events like Django con Australia

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,760
can happen without having to take on the

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,109
risk that is associate or the financial

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,109
risk that is associated with organizing

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,340
an event of this size and scale but as a

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,840
result of being a mini conference we

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,180
also don't have a huge budget the

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,200
tickets were cheap compared to the

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,510
plaque on Australia tickets even the

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,590
park on Australia tickets were cheap but

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,909
because it's a cheap mini conference

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,030
ticket we don't have a budget for things

00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:32,950
like t-shirts so as with last year we

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,670
doing a fundraiser around a genuine

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:40,420
Australia shirt if you want you can log

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,250
on to teespring com /d CAU 2014 and

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,290
place an order this is effectively a

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,050
Kickstarter style thing we must Russ

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,180
receive 50 orders if we receive 50

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,680
orders then the shirts get printed make

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,390
it shipped out if you don't if we don't

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,970
then all bets are off no one loses any

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:58,390
money they are available in an America

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,220
sorry in a mens unisex style shirt a

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,040
women's cut shirt and as a hoodie this

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,150
year as well so the t-shirts are twenty

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,830
dollars the hoodies are thirty dollars

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,810
sorry that's us twenty dollars and

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,250
thirty dollars shipping is a little it

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,290
expensive it's ten dollars for the first

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,380
item and one dollar fifty for every item

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,000
after that but if you have local user

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,290
groups I would hardly heartily suggest

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,610
that you pitch together because if you

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,260
can get a bunch of you all on the same

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,360
user group to put in a collective order

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,210
the chipping shared over all those

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,820
orders comes down very very rapidly the

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,060
Kickstarter runs until the end of friar

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,680
Sunday week so August 10th you have

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,270
until August 10th to place your orders

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,750
organized amongst your users groups to

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,940
make that happen so yes teespring com DC

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,180
ru 2014 I will be tweeting about that so

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,730
everyone knows where the link is and now

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,310
on with the show our first speaker our

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,220
keynote speaker today is miss kita KO KD

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,630
Cunningham she's formerly of NASA where

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,520
she discovered Django was involved in

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,100
using Django at NASA she is now with the

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,560
Cox Media Group and is also an author

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,480
with books printed by both O'Reilly and

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,240
the Pearson Pearson press and I think

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,290
she's got a couple others in the works

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,790
coming down the pipeline she is here

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,560
today to talk about that experience of

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,150
being an author and the experience of

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,740
getting documentation out there and

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,330
django has always had a very strong

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,890
tradition of having good documentation

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,960
but that doesn't mean we go we can't

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,850
improve and we can't have more of it so

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,950
without further ado I would like to

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,430
invite to the stage the real Katie Katie

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,430
Cunningham

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,520
