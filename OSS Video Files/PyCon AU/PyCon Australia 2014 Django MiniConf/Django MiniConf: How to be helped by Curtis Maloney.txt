community Kurtis is an engineer with

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,950
common code and he is here today to tell

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,950
us how to be helped

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:30,419
hey now anyone I've got to ask a few

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:35,070
questions up front anyone here used the

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:37,860
Jenga IRC channel on freenode not enough

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,510
of you you're missing out there's not

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,739
only does Russell hang out there and I

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,010
hang out there and a bunch of other

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,449
people lots of people wanting to help

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,010
you hanging out there ready it's free

00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:52,829
consulting people I mean people pay for

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,050
my time and his time you get it free if

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,180
you come and ask and be nice and make us

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,090
want to help you she's kind of where

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,280
this talk comes in a lot of people make

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:09,030
us not want to help them you don't want

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,950
to be those people as he said I'm funky

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,930
Bob and on github it's funky Bob on Ric

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,520
his funky Bob I've done a few things for

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,369
the community Django Knapp is one of the

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,810
smaller lesser-known

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:21,950
API toolkits but it's actually grown

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,680
recently to include RPC not just restful

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,820
formulation is my attempt at a

00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,409
template-based form rendering that is

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,189
efficient unlike some of the other

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,860
solutions we were part of the team who

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,869
provided you with the ie7 tax over at

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,450
Cogan so that if you tried to check out

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:44,280
using ie7 you had to pay extra for

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,740
making our life a miserable hell I was

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,759
awarded Malcolm Trudeau Memorial Prize

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,950
and very honored for that to be

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,680
recognized I met him in 2007 when I got

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,049
this t-shirt and he was an incredible

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,979
person who just made everybody around

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,229
him feel like doing more just the way he

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,360
spoke enthusiastically and passionately

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,660
about everything he was doing everybody

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,720
just felt like riding that wave of

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,370
energy and doing more and I've been

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,819
helping in jail I tried to find out how

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,609
long I've been helping on

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,829
Shengo I went to the online logs but

00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:23,590
because of how much I put in you can't

00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:28,109
go over 200 pages of searches back and

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,400
so that would only take me back to 2012

00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:32,829
so I checked and I registered my

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,950
nickname in 2006 so I've been helping

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:38,709
since at least then I did find Django

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,909
basically when it became a public

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:46,299
project why do I help that's a good

00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:48,189
question I feel basically and this is

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,810
part of why I felt very odd about

00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,370
accepting the Malcom tried any prize at

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,439
first it's because I'm just doing what I

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,969
was taught to do you help people but I

00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,129
also find it in helping people I've been

00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,750
inspired to write other apps and other

00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,340
tools ideas that I just wouldn't have

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,590
come up with on my own I mean it happens

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,120
during your work normally but everybody

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,639
knows it feels a lot better to do

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,449
something for everyone to benefit from

00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,829
not just your employer I wrote snip

00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,299
lights for somebody who wandered into

00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:20,079
the channel and said I'm coming from the

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:22,349
rails background and I want partials in

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,879
my templates

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,229
two hours later I handed him a project

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,949
and snip lights eventually became

00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,569
formulation which is growing in

00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:35,139
popularity and if I believe the pipe a

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:36,939
statistics is actually in a lot of use I

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,620
learn a lot from helping other people

00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,849
and you can too there are certain

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,489
schools of thought that say that you

00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,930
can't learn enough without becoming a

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:49,239
teacher and one of the big things I

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,489
learn is what's still wrong with Django

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,040
we know it's there sometimes it's just

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,560
the documentation but since I've been

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,329
using it for over eight years I don't

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,099
see what's not clear in the

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:08,199
documentation new people do so that's

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:13,810
good know yeah here's some examples of

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:15,250
what you're doing wrong over the years

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,199
I've developed a phrase which has helped

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,849
me try to extract from people the

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,949
information I need it's tell me the

00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,599
problem that you want to solve not the

00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,889
solution you want to fix there's anybody

00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:28,240
here familiar with the X wide problem

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,700
that's basically the definition of the

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,920
ex-wife

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,630
somebody's finished reading it so

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,820
sometimes somebody comes along and says

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,790
I want to do this with that which in

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,770
itself is sensible but sometimes this is

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,990
a chocolate-covered banana and sometimes

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:48,790
that is integration of European currency

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,230
systems it just doesn't make sense so we

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,690
get people coming in and they're asking

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,070
about how can I solve this problem that

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,990
they're not telling you what the problem

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,230
is they're asking you how can I fix my

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,270
solution and it takes time to dig

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,440
through and get out of them what the

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,910
actual problem is they're trying to

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,590
solve this oh no no I don't have a

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,300
bigger problem if you didn't have a

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,340
bigger problem you wouldn't you have a

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,870
job you wouldn't be doing whatever

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,610
you're doing you are trying to implement

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,860
your solution it's not working you've

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,110
come and asked for help we need to know

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,520
that problem before we can help fix your

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,190
solution because we don't know what your

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,169
end goal is here's a little example most

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,070
of these imperfect all of these examples

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,540
I've pulled out of the Django IRC logs

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,910
this person turns up says I want to show

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,530
the fields of adjacent file in an HTML

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,010
form how can I do this with Django

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,900
sounds pretty sensible not at all what

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,020
it is asking for I mean you can do that

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,500
you can use a JSON file to tell you how

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,020
what fields to build and what values

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,600
they can be and all the rest of it 24

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,860
minutes later we finally get out so what

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,190
you really want to do is how can I

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,690
present a form to edit my settings

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,240
predefined fields which is stored in

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,550
Jason that's a much easier problem to

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,970
solve but it's not the one he presented

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,600
as up front

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:10,320
this one yeah sounds like you've all had

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,470
it I've got an error oh really

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:19,240
any particular error just one on holiday

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:21,039
no be clear be specific give us details

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,130
details of great details are important

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,640
as it says in the topic of the Django

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,590
channel give us your code and a full

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,610
trace back of what went wrong then we

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,110
can start debugging oftentimes somebody

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,789
will come in and say I'm doing this by

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,050
doing that they'll tell you the problem

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:41,639
they'll tell you how there are solutes

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,500
that what their solution is and it's not

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,220
it's the wrong way to go about it you

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,830
tell them it's not right and I say no

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,180
not doing it wrong if you're not doing

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,889
it wrong why isn't it working why are

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,220
you asking for help if you're not doing

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:04,610
it wrong oftentimes they'll try to

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:07,020
assert that the tool is broken but well

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,600
some people try to come along describe

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,009
their problem in an abstract way rather

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,900
than specifically what they're trying to

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,250
do and sometimes this is a good choice

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,870
because you don't want to get into the

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,250
nitty-gritty of what your names are and

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,270
why other people can't understand it

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,550
because you're writing in French fine

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:30,150
one person came and asked this and so we

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:32,729
sort of went yeah okay kinda it all

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,370
makes sense on the surface of it and a

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,930
little while later I got out of them

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,150
what they were really trying to do they

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,150
had this table of ranks to allow users

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:46,260
to rank games and he said I want all the

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:48,240
unranked games for a specific user now

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,330
this suddenly becomes a lot easier to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,229
solve because I can imagine what you're

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:59,340
doing it now takes on a real conceptual

00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,710
form for me as soon as that description

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,810
came out the answer was obvious he had

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,680
his problem solved and he was on his way

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,750
that's great

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:14,580
but that took a while to get out this is

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,919
my personal bug bit somebody comes along

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,620
says I got a problem I need to solve it

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,229
you go okay well if that probably a

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,800
problem then you solve it doing this and

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,830
I go yeah that would work but I can't do

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,800
this oh okay well then you'll have to do

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:36,810
it this way yeah but I can't because I

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,779
have to do this ad nauseam and they just

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,159
drip drip drip moral constraints instead

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,659
of telling you up front what all the

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,810
limits are so you can provide them a

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,910
solution that actually matches their

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,570
constraints but they can't see why

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,190
you're getting annoyed with them so

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,880
rather than just be all negative and I

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,030
was possibly going to not

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,410
all that negative stuff how can we do

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:05,260
better remember that we're all

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,950
volunteers nobody is obliged to help you

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,390
nobody owes you anything if you come

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:14,530
into the channel and you ask for help

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,510
and somebody tries to help there is no

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,950
obligation for them to stick around and

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,770
finish helping you and if you're

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,440
difficult to help they're just not going

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,090
to want to it's not worth your time if I

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,820
was in a business situation I was being

00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,820
paid to help you that's a different game

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,140
this one amazes me people come in they

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,200
ask if I did this what that work would

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,020
this be a problem suck it and see as we

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,390
used to say in Sparky school does it

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,740
work try it out most of the time these

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,100
people are asking things that would be

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,250
quicker to test then it would be to ask

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,620
about it try it did you get the results

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,750
then come and say hey I tried this I got

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,510
this result is this the right way to go

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,270
or it didn't work out the way I wanted

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,520
what can I do

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,340
I'll always like somebody who has a read

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,700
the docs and be tried something because

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:14,530
then you've got somebody to work from

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,000
hey this doc turned up again and anybody

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,320
here familiar with the process of rubber

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,730
ducking okay it comes from the story of

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,660
a person who had a rubber duck on his

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,010
desk so that when he ran into a problem

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,250
he would describe the problem to his

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,780
rubber duck has a strange thing that a

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,250
lot of brain science people will explain

00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,830
to you in depth if you ever get them

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:42,310
drinking at a party which they do a lot

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:45,490
just having to formulate your problem

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:49,270
into verbal language not typed language

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:52,210
not thoughts changes the problem in your

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:55,450
mind having to realize how much you have

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,590
to explain to somebody else will make

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,540
you think about it in a different way

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,100
and this can help you solve problems it

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,830
did yesterday for somebody I was talking

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,450
to I do it frequently oh you've been a

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,400
target I'll just turn to the people I

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,019
know in IRC so do you mind quacking for

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,129
me for

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,959
sound boarding is another description

00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,220
somebody described it as earrings teddy

00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,720
bear and I like that idea because

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:21,799
cheering needs a few more things

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:23,509
dedicated to him answer our questions is

00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,669

of questions from us yes all of our

00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:37,549
questions no not the questions you

thought we are asked or think we're

00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:45,410
trying to get add the ones we actually

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:48,019
asked because we're not mind reader's we

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,489
can't look at your code through the net

00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:53,839
we're not going to admit to being able

00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:56,419
to hack into your computer do you've got

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,339

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:05,749
people helping you and don't waste our

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:09,109
time because it's our time and it's not

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:10,669
paid for it's not your time if you come

00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:13,189
in and you ask a question don't sit

00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:16,040
around if we ask you questions actually

00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:17,839
come back with the answers don't waffle

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,779
on about again what you think the

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,980
problem is we had this guy come in I

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,779
said look I'm gonna need more details

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,160
this is like what okay good we're

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:28,069
getting somewhere he's willing to give

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,959
details I need to know you URL can't

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:32,110
file need to know this maybe some more

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,730
details about how you've configured that

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:38,929
Graham wasn't available to pester about

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,899
my WSGI we miss your Graham and anything

00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:48,470
else owned is anything even working in

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:50,989
your project nothing if you look at the

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,449
timestamps there you'll see that's

00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:57,309
another eight minutes nine minutes later

00:12:53,449 --> 00:13:00,799
and he comes up and says alright

00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:02,269
somebody says hey I've had I've had my

00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,410
time I said before by people who are

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,859
just saying I just removed the

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,209
unimportant stuff until it turned out to

00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:09,829
be critical to their problem he's gone

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,389
oh no I'm sensitive to the needs I'm

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:15,049
understanding that I don't want to waste

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:17,799
people's time and we still didn't get a

00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:20,870
paste for another or five minutes later

00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,730
that person did not make it easy to help

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,950
we ask for the information it wasn't a

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,810
lot of information to give it still took

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,220
15 minutes to get any information out of

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:33,860
them despite them saying they don't want

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:35,180
to waste people's time if you don't

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,589
believe me that it's very hard to help

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,910
people and as I said I've had a lot of

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,440
practice I've been doing this not just

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,000
in the Django community for eight years

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,310
I used to help on a general coding

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,880
Channel for about seven years before

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:50,060
that come along and try it out yourself

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,740
anyone can help out on now on IRC sure

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,210
yeah you may feel some performance

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,510
anxiety because there are a lot of

00:13:53,210 --> 00:14:00,250
people watching you but much rather have

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:04,190
people trying to help out and not try it

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,839
please come and help you have all got

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,760
wonderful experience there and although

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,350
somebody was saying hey you know you'll

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,700
come and come hire this consultant

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,350
because we know more than you it's no

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,120
it's because you know other things than

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,950
me I know a lot of things about my

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,720
fields you know I think that your fields

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,250
we get the right people in there we know

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,350
everything about everything but that's

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,760
going to take a lot of people an

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,130
important thing to remember when you're

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,510
helping people is sometimes as

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,970
exposition is a really good thing

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,190
explaining a lot more detail about the

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,990
problem or the solution then you might

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,490
at first think is necessary even when

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,040
you think the other person understands

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,080
it because you're talking to more than

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,640
just that person this everyone else in

00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,380
the channel at the time which is usually

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,050
following between four to six hundred

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,760
people and there's everybody reviewing

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,250
the logs afterwards which includes

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:58,910
Google so hey that's it I've probably

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,290
gone incredibly quickly and I well know

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,060
sometimes the questions before we go to

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,620
the questions I'd like to point out

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,510
something that happened earlier today I

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,000
think it's kind of important for

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,980
everyone to think about I got here

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,350
earlier and I ran into Russell and I was

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,860
in a strange headspace and Russell said

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,190
to me hey are you ok how are you doing

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,640
how are things with you are you in a

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,600
good place

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,510
I don't we had a little chat about how

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,370
things were and so on but both of us

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,589
agree that there's a lot more people

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,839
realizing or establishing that they have

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,340
some sort of mental health issue one way

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,840
or another

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,760
oppression is incredibly common this

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,560
beyondblue to help and so on but

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:43,990
sometimes all it takes is somebody to

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:46,390
stop and ask I wasn't in a particularly

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,040
bad spot but I had been recently and

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,250
it's nice to have people just stop and

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:56,860
ask it doesn't take much there is an

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:58,510
initiative called blue hackers it's

00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,830
worth looking into and just in the

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,500
general sense I think we can all help

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,500
each other out that way anyway questions

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,350
so yeah again thank you very much Curtis

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,710
and please form a queue at the the

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,300
market if you want to ask questions

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,500
getting the ball rolling here so how did

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,360
you get over your performance anxiety

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,370
asking the first time I mean I know it's

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,300
a it's a you have been doing for a long

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,950
time you said you've been doing for a

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,570
long time and you said everybody hate

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,010
just come and do it but there is that

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,460
performance anxiety for the first time

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,170
how did you get over it I think what

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,790
happens is what happened was I wound up

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,520
in the channel started asking questions

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,960
because I needed help and then after a

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,250
while you build up your own body of

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,690
knowledge of where you feel confident

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,160
that you know the right answers now when

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,650
I started there there was somebody who

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,900
was in channel all the time helping out

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,000
a lot who eventually kind of got pushed

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,170
out of the community somewhat because

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,150
they could be a bit abrasive at times

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,580
which is I find kind of interesting

00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,000
because I modeled my behavior in there

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,890
on them and I wasn't asked to leave and

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,900
as why actually at first I didn't think

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,370
I had a chance with the tradition price

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,870
because I could be a bit abrasive as it

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,370
says wise funky pop angry with me

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,290
I get angry they are really angry

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:15,670
sometimes shout and people don't like

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:19,690
and they shout spit I need to work on

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,850
that that's my issue but yeah you get

00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,410
confidence just in knowing what you know

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,940
and sometimes it's just a matter of

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,260
doing what you know would be the right

00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,050
thing to do when you see that problem

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,480
which is hit Google and read the dots I

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,980
think a lot of people have been trained

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,980
out of reading the docs because of

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,980
projects with she dogs and now we need

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,660
to retrain them go and look at them they

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,890
will answer your questions if they don't

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,890
then come and ask us

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,930
just some advice on helping people yeah

00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,120
when you're given a problem do you give

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,070
the person here's the specific solution

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,730
or do you give them a vague maybe have a

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,560
look at this or that that really depends

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,260
on the person and the problem if the

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,310
person seems like they really know what

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,670
they're doing I mean if there's somebody

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:12,950
of established I know and I know that I

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:14,630
can just they've got a specific problem

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,310
and they need a specific solution on the

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,570
spot and they clearly understand all the

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,430
rest of it but there's something they've

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,140
stumbled onto that maybe is a bug or a

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,840
gotcha and then I'll just give them a

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,910
little bit but in general I try to make

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,060
sure that everybody I'm not here as a

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,850
person to do your work and there is I'm

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:35,300
how I want to help people learn more so

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,990
my focus is definitely go look here on

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,610
this subject

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,680
sometimes yeah a lot of people just need

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,660
the key words to know what to search for

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,040
so you say okay here's the link go and

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,810
read about this here's the link I read

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,010
about this here are some concepts on how

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,310
you're going to join those things

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,420
together I want you to figure it out

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,010
because otherwise you just build a

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:57,080
dependency on me yeah it's not good for

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:59,060
either this Thanks so you were talking

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,160
about problems with people being slow to

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,710
apply now see I'm curious what your

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,830
opinion is on IRC versus mailing lists

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,990
for that kind of support like is the

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,110
enforced like a synchronous main list

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,580
better for that kind of thing what I say

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,010
on mailing lists is people tend to

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,290
because they know that there's going to

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,210
be a longer time between question

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,070
response you do tend to get a lot more

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,980
upfront this about the information

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,300
they're providing but actually to be

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,620
honest I don't spend a lot of time on

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:32,480
mailing list so don't have a lot

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,550
comparison yeah but my experience has

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,160
been generally because people know the

00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:40,040
extended latency you don't have this

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,420
problem quite so much even so it's quite

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,580
regularly to see on the Django dev

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,440
mailing list somebody thought put in a

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,300
request and then Russell will be there

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,640
ten minutes later saying you want to ask

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:55,730
on Django users so yeah sometimes people

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,370
just don't read the the outline first

00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,730
yeah

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,500
sort of a sort of different topic I've

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,600
had a lot of problems in designing

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,730
migrations in people going I've got a

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,740
problem allegations what is it things

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,120
break and the same kind of role that I

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,559
would like well we need to look at why

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,360
and people like and say something about

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,760
people go oh here's it here's an ABC 7

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,620
models and like same kind of difficult

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,270
to reproduce nice like using this

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,840
specially some value in having a sort of

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,340
a more standard document a sign that

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,080
says these things more front like you

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,480
try not to anonymize try to give us some

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,179
information like and explaining why and

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,760
getting reasoning or yeah I think what

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,200
is your end goal is frequently the

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,400
question that needs to be chanted in

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,710
front of people you know why are you

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:43,290
doing this what what is the task you've

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:45,059
been assigned and so on yeah I mean

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,910
there are a number of support forums

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:49,559
that have their standard format query

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,420
which is what we're trying to do what

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,450
did you expect to happen what actually

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:58,520
happened and and that is sometimes a set

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,520
of questions we have to ask people oops

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,559
so yeah sometimes I mean it does become

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,630
reflex after a while of asking people

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,610
the same old questions over and over

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,090
again just to try and get the

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,340
information

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,170
it took a while to come up with the

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,240
right words that are universally

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:21,360
accepted as step back and tell me the

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,929
real problem thank you okay thank you

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,929
very much Curtis
