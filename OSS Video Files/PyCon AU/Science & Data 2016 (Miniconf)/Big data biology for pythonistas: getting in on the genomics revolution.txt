In 2001 Bill Clinton unveiled "the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind" - the human genome. This monumental endeavour cost $3 billion, and took hundreds of scientists from all over the world 13 years. Today, a single person can generate such a map in ~2 days for $1000. This dramatic drop in cost means that we now have data for hundreds of thousands of people - and other species - from all corners of the globe, and cohorts are available for every major disease under the sun. Petabytes of new data are also being generated every day.

Most of this data is publicly available, so anyone with an internet connection can try in silico biology from the comfort of their own home. In my talk, I'll walk through what this data looks like, and how it's analysed - with a special focus on where python fits into the workflow (;tldr the most interesting parts!). I will also highlight some common pitfalls software engineers and developers face when getting into this space. Finally, I'll showcase several other facets of bioinformatics that sorely need contributions from good coders.

Genomics is rapidly entering the world of health care in both the public and private hospital sectors, and in direct-to-consumer genetic testing. Understanding this data, the challenges and limitations of its analytics will help us all make better-informed health and medical decisions, affecting our quality of life and those we love.

good afternoon everyone thank you for

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:09,030
coming and welcome to the today's last

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,269
session of the science and data mining

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,360
co we have our three last three speakers

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,570
for the day and the first one is dr.

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,029
Daria vanish keener she's a genomics

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,740
data scientists at the centenary

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,490
Institute at the University of Sydney

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,920
and she is going to talk about Big Data

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,619
biology for Python estas getting in on

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:39,870
the genomic revolution Daria vanish

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:42,059
canal so good afternoon Everett Cameron

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,550
hear me yep so good afternoon everyone

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,680
so my name is Daria and I'm a genomics

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,250
data scientist AKA a blind from

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,250
attrition so my first question is who

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,899
here is a biologist anyone okay so this

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,360
talk is probably not so much for you

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,489
this is for everyone else because I'm

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,530
going to try to make biology simple and

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,329
make biology a little bit more

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,559
accessible and the structure my talk is

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,850
going to go like this so I'm going to

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,890
explain to you who I am and where I come

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,860
from and why now is the most exciting

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,420
time ever to be in biology I am going to

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,909
talk about a little bit about the

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,950
biology of life stuff you probably

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,030
learned in high school and why it's not

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,799
as simple as what you learned in high

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,820
school then i'm going to show you what

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,560
biological data actually looks like and

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,030
case studies of how biological data is

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,210
actually impacting us in the real world

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,759
and highlight some other areas in

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,720
biology broadly that need development

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,140
talent so first off why biology and why

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,299
now and this is the figure that we

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,509
always put up when we do these kinds of

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,140
talks as from the National Human Genome

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,759
Research Institute and horrible

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,979
realization but what it's showing you is

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,540
it showing you the cost the amount of

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,259
money it takes to sequence a human

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,820
genome so in 2001 Bill Clinton announced

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,450
woohoo we've sequenced the human genome

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,219
it took 16 years three billion dollars

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,950
and a team of scientists from all over

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,560
the world so it was great but you

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,910
couldn't really do that a lot because

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
that three billion dollars a pop that's

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,880
kind of expensive

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,489
but the amazing thing that's happened

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,110
since is due to some really really cool

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,989
technological innovation some of which

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,700
is shown here um the cost of doing that

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,180
has actually dropped to the point where

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,250
it right now technically it takes under

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,330
a thousand dollars and under about two

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,540
or three days that you can actually

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,819
sequence a genome so this has allowed us

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,010
to ask completely new types of questions

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,180
and do you really really really cool

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,440
things and this is what one of these

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,910
machines actually look like that does

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,819
this so next question why should you

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,519
care and if your human being in the 21st

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,230
century you actually do care and the

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,780
reason for this is simple this is either

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,690
already in or coming tomorrow to a

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,930
hospital near you and this is going to

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,280
change how you get treated because the

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,959
drugs you get given are going to no

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,980
longer be given oh let's try this oh it

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,690
didn't work okay let's try something

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,849
else you're actually gonna be able to

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,400
look at what's wrong with you in a lot

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,130
of diseases and suggest exactly the drug

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,110
that is known to work against exactly

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,489
what's wrong with you the other thing is

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,290
this has revolutionized prenatal

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,150
diagnostics of things like Down syndrome

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,829
and I'll talk a little bit about that so

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,100
and this is already implemented in the

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,329
clinic intriguingly um unlike a lot of

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,299
stuff which has been just really pushed

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,859
down from science out to the rule the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,870
uptake of this in the real world has

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,060
really been driven by people going I

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,500
want this and voting with their feet so

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,540
in the US where you can choose which

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,170
clinician you go to people have found

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,090
that patients go and work try to take

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,560
themselves or their families to

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,750
clinicians that have taken up these

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,639
technologies so it's being driven very

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,560
much by the patient and it is going to

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,750
revolutionize how we understand and deal

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,889
with old age fitness and a lot of other

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,190
things that affects this number of the

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,959
world so a little bit about what we're

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,670
actually doing with so this is a very

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,459
simple schematic of what it takes to be

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,560
alive / Cuban also known as the central

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,680
dogma molecular biology and the central

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,930
dogma states that in each one of

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,239
ourselves we've got some DNA which is in

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,109
the nucleus or ourselves and it's made

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,130
up of AC GS and C's the double helix of

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,070
you ever want to make anything look

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,050
science he's such as Korean beauty masks

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,840
you draw some DNA on it no relation to

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,919
actually what's in them but it looks

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,470
sciency so we're gonna draw it so it's

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,300
DNA's like this double helix thing is

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:39,949
everywhere and actually it's in yourself

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:41,630
and we have about six billion basis of

00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,310
DNA and every single cell in our body of

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,900
any case you're wondering thirty-seven

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,350
point two trillion cells in our actual

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,960
bodies and they're packaged into 23

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,220
pairs of chromosomes and you get half

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,660
your chromosome from your mom and have

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,860
your chromosomes from your dad then this

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,139
DNA through a process called

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,139
transcription in the nucleus of the cell

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,820
gets made into something called RNA

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:08,510
which is basically a one-to-one and Cody

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,550
accept your tea is changed to use so and

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,300
then that gets exported out into the

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:17,060
cytoplasm of ourselves and made it to

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,639
proteins and we've got approximately at

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,590
latest analyses behind just about 20,000

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,979
regions of the DNA that get made into

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,760
these protein things and here the

00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,490
encoding is a little bit more

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,010
complicated where three nucleic acids

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,180
get made into one amino acid and there

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,190
is a code for this it's called the

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,510
genetic code is forget in the 60s so we

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,750
know that if you've got this get them a

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,100
cyanine etc etc etc so basically looking

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,260
at the sequence you can figure out what

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,099
it's going to encode for so this is the

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,450
central dogma of local biology now and

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,220
this is usually what you learn about in

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,260
high school it's actually not that

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,300
simple so first of all and this is

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,250
really cool you can actually have

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,520
modifications that don't affect the base

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,690
pair but they'd of your DNA and some of

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,760
these actually have been in response to

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,169
environmental factors so hey Jordan this

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,210
is how that feeds back so these don't

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:08,270
get inherited necessarily some of them

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,039
do but and they don't change what you're

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,050
coding for it but there are ways to put

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,200
signals in here in addition to this you

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,229
can have changes called RNA editing in

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,820
your RNA which will then potentially

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:24,110
change what your protein becomes because

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,520
you cheat you can change it amino acids

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,550
so I don't have seen you a see codes for

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,889
tyrosine UIC is basically something is

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,210
UTC sats clothes for cysteine so you get

00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,560
a different amino acid in your protein

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,870
or you can have modification of these

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,490
proteins as well also I told you they're

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,810
about 20,000 protein coding genes

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,000
turns out there's a ton of stuff that

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,460
gets made into RNA that never gets made

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,229
into protein so these RNAs actually

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,970
function ourselves and do something and

00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,780
that was what much to my PhD focused on

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,979
but coming back to the central dogma

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,229
you're already looking at this and say

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,569
AHA this is actually an atg c string

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,690
this is really really easy to encode so

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:04,310
and the DNA which is on ourselves all

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,560
together is known as the genome and the

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,819
coding which are known as the XO RNA all

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,030
together is known as the transcriptome

00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,699
and that's an au GC string and then

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,110
proteins if we actually have 21 amino

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,990
acids that you can encode and that's

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,750
they're listed here so this is the 21

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,669
letter string so the data is actually

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,039
straight and what can you do with this

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,500
well you can try to understand disease

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,120
especially rare Mendelian ones you can

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,860
identify family relationship so you can

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,380
look at ethnic origins carrier status

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,030
for diseases you can do target drug

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,970
prescription rational design side

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,229
effects and catch people or hope is good

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,370
disease and this is one of my favorite

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,840
figures that I just wanted to throw in

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,599
here so this is from a study done

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,729
several years ago not by me where they

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,250
looked at in the genomes of people in

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,229
Europe the variable regions and they try

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,880
to see okay if we take lots and lots of

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,190
people in sequence these variable

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,990
regions well what does that data look

00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,880
like and what we're looking at here is a

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,460
principal components analysis of that

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,960
data and you can see that based just on

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,460
their genetic variability he can

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,259
reconstruct a map of Europe so here

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,289
we've got the Portuguese Spanish you've

00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,810
got a british irish over here you've got

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,430
and even to the point where down here

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,889
we're actually looking at switzerland

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,380
you can separate out the French speaking

00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,120
Swiss the German speaking Swiss and the

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,099
Italian speaking Swiss which cluster

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,110
closer together to their respective

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,729
countries France Germany Italy so that's

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,849
the level of resolution you can get with

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,110
this kind of data it's amazing so how do

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,310
you actually analyze it coming back to

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,469
the data so i told you it was a string

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,849
of the waste agencies well usually you

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,890
try to do paired samples so you either

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,589
take in the case of pan so you take a

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,000
tumor tissue and a normal tissue or in

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,940
the case of rare disease if you try to

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,010
sequence an affected patient and members

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,570
of their family so for this technology

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,360
to work you've got to shred your DNA

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,190
into small pieces and at the end of the

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,350
day you get this back this is actually

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,540
one read and you

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,220
10 to 100 millions of these more per

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,320
data set that's what this is called the

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,410
fescue format which is basically first

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,140
line is some information about okay this

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,240
is my data set how the sequencing was

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,450
done this is my actual atg c string and

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,250
n is where the software couldn't call

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,590
the base so it does know what there is

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,530
and plus sign and then in this line you

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,690
have this score which shows is encoding

00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,950
for how accurately the machine thinks it

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,020
called the base so basically how

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,380
accurate is this vehicle how much can

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,820
you trust it and there's a really really

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,880
great expedition on Wikipedia for how to

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,170
actually read this so you get 100

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,540
million of these what do you do next

00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,490
well next you map them back to a

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,030
reference in this case you map them back

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,260
to a reference genome so these a lot

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,760
they're using alignment program which

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,560
are independently a couple of the most

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,740
commonly used one for this task or bwn

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,930
bowtie to and the output is a sample

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,460
called sequence alignment map and one

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,830
example of that so this is what the data

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,870
looks like at this stage you've got your

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,100
identifiers again over here you're not

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,960
the chromosome where it is you've got

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,780
the starting position this is showing

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,620
you that you know the entire 75 basis of

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,880
your read seem to match the genome and

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,110
there's some older information about how

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,900
well it might somebody missed leches

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,010
matches and I've linked here to more

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,100
details about how to actually interpret

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,330
this type of data okay we've read we've

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,640
mapped it back to genome we've got lots

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,210
and lots of records in the stamp on out

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,320
what's next well effectively what you're

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,940
doing with that record over there is

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,580
you're stacking up your reads against

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,850
the chromosomes so here I've drawn five

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,140
short reads and I'm showing you

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,550
something two things that can happen so

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,620
one thing I can happen if you can have

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,180
them just perfectly match but quite

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,610
frequently you have positions that don't

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,620
match and sometimes this is errors but

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,330
sometimes you have consistently that

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,850
fifty or one hundred percent of your

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,750
reads will not match the reference

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:53,440
genome and in this case these matches

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,700
are called a single nucleotide variants

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,570
are similar nucleotide polymorphisms and

00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,860
if they're larger they're called

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,060
deletions or insertions depending on

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,380
whether you've got sequence in your

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,320
sequence that's not there in the genome

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,220
or vice versa you're missing stuff and

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,620
you're basically find the differences

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,750
reference

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,010
and you each of us have quite a large

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,450
number of differences to the reference

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:14,420
and in case you're wondering what the

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,420
references in 2001 that was I believe 11

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,810
of men of European ancestry sequencer in

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,830
Buffalo New York so if you are European

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,030
and male you're going to have probably

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,700
the least amount of differences from

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,250
that reference genome if you are for

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,600
example of East Asian or African you're

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,550
going to have more differences so that's

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,560
one of the challenges actually what

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,150
we're doing with this data and in the

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,470
last 20 years we've tried to sequence

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,420
more genius to begin to address this

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,010
okay find the difference this is

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,220
reference you've got lots and lots of

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,830
them and just to remind you this is why

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,300
we need trios because we inherit pepper

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,230
chromosomes from mom however chromosomes

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,460
from dad so you add some diseases are

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,260
caused where you need to get faulty

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,350
copies on both chromosomes in other

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,540
cases one faulty copy is enough to get

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,580
the disease and we also have what are

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,680
called de novo mutations which are

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,410
mutations that are present in the child

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,390
but not present in the parents at all

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,160
and sometimes those clif diseases so

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,110
okay calling the variants that is what

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,910
our data looks like now which shows us

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,890
okay chromosome position ID so we

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,390
basically have chromosome 20 position

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,670
that's the coordinate in the chromosome

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,560
that's the name of our variant in the

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,120
reference we have a g delta T allele

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,220
we're actually seeing so the base we're

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,580
seeing is an a and the quality shows us

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,960
how likely that coal is did it pass our

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,330
filters and then we've got lots of other

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,000
info again I've linked to more details

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,230
on the file format specification and

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,110
remember that our variants can be either

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,400
homozygous which is also both copies of

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,260
our chromosomes are affected or

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,040
heterozygous where we have the mutation

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:49,670
in one a copy of our chromosomes and we

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,840
don't have it in another and here are

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,280
links to a bunch of tutorials that

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,050
actually had if you want to play with

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,000
this type of data these are tutorials

00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,380
for how you can do variant calling which

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,240
is basically a list of tools that you

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,670
need to do this and how do you how you

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,250
get these Falls but the real challenge

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,660
of course is what does this mean right

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,620
I've shown you lots of files I've showed

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,330
me okay we've got lots of differences

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,770
and I've told you we have lots and lots

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,770
of differences between even Austin our

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,690
parents and the way we act should

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,070
interpret this at the moment is first we

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,230
see if any of the observed variants

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,480
actually match stuff we've seen before

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,029
so does do too

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,350
mutations we have match up previously

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,610
identified mutations that have been

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,860
associated with some kind of a disease

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,130
and I'd like to get databases where you

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,050
work we can see this and the second

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,430
thing we do is we try to predict based

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,709
on remember I showed you that genetic

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,420
code well is this mutation going to

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,829
break a protein by introducing a stop

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,149
instead of where we should have had lots

00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:42,740
and lots of neat o acids afterwards

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,589
because a few of those codons credit for

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,860
stop stop making a protein or if you

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,000
miss one base remember it was a 33 you

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,070
had to have three bases in a coat on

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,350
well if you miss one that means

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,329
everything from that position onwards is

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,579
shifted by one it's a frame ship so

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:00,290
basically all of it results in is you're

00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:02,600
inserting the wrong amino acid from that

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:06,050
position all the way down so your

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,579
proteins broken or you can have a change

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,930
just at one position but it's in a

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,310
critical amino acids so something that's

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,329
actually located in a very very

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,790
important part of the protein that

00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:17,920
actually does for example the catalysis

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:20,029
so that's at the moment what we do and

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,120
there's technologies with this so first

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,769
of all you get lots and lots of changes

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
so all of us have proteins that are

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,880
broken all of us have if we sequence

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,529
normal people and normal even trios

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,540
you're still going to have changes which

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,500
you're going to identify flag as oh this

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,420
is probably going to call something to

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,130
break but we're not actually inflicted

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,470
so how do you in the case of when you're

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,240
trying to model disease actually figure

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,480
out which which of the mutations you've

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,959
identified is the disease-causing one

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,829
the second one is that well you don't

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,760
always have a trio and the statistics

00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:55,250
and tools that we have at the moment

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,819
always system so trio is mom dad and a

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,290
child and or any and if other unaffected

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,490
siblings that you have as well so if you

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,680
have that type of a structure it's

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,779
really much easier for you to filter out

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,699
variants that are benign versus variants

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,380
that are actually causing the disease if

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,910
you don't have that what do you do how

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,810
do you actually help that type of

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,300
patient accurately and reliably another

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,940
thing is that a lot of our knowledge

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,300
about how how genes work is based on

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,000
correlation so we see that some you know

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,470
oh you knock something out you see that

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,790
other stuff goes up and down and we say

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,740
okay this is associated with the same

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,529
pathway but here I've actually plotted

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,100
in watching you can see it I've plotted

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,350
number of people

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,180
who trip and I on the trip on their GP

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:45,079
and died and the number of lawyers in

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:46,730
Nevada um doesn't really yep now put

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,880
this into classics of disease right and

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,100
finally genes don't work alone they work

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,300
in very complex networks and when you

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,740
lose one you might have compensatory

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,779
mechanism and other things that we do

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,339
not take into account and most of our

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,110
models marbling don't take months into

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,329
account so now how is this actually

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,040
being implemented right well first of

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,139
all um in the UK there's a project

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,670
called genomics England which is their

00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,959
sequencing a hundred thousand genomes as

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,730
part of the NHS which is a government

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,079
health service and I've shamelessly

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,490
stolen some of their info graphics

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,470
because they're really good for what

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,850
they're doing and long story short

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,029
they're generating lots and lots of

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,319
genomes lots and lots of patients

00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,880
getting a little lots of centres and

00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,680
it's all amazing and wonderful and

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,050
they're looking at rare diseases and

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,339
they're looking at cancers now the

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,720
reason they look at rare disease is

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,009
that's the ones where trios work and

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,279
there's the ones where it's most likely

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:36,620
that it's a one-gene thing and cancer

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,089
your secret tumor versus normal and the

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,069
poster child and the success story that

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,480
they've had with this is a little girl

00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,920
by the name of Jessica Wright who came

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,600
in with epilepsy and movement disorder

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,759
developmental to say she had had

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,680
standard testing which included MRIs

00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,870
lumbar punctures electroencephalograms

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,579
and a bunch of tested you know lumbar

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,620
punctures painful this is a little girl

00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:56,360
and none of that helped and told her

00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,189
what was wrong and when they sequenced

00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,810
the genome they identified there was a

00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:01,370
de novo mutations the only in her not on

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,930
her parents of glute one which is

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,400
thankfully than sequence of the protein

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,230
structures identified so I can present

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,669
it here and it codes for protein

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,569
responsible for transporting glucose

00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:14,209
from the blood into the brain and it

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,890
turns out that if you know this you can

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,169
actually put her on a ketogenic guy it's

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,760
a low-carbohydrate high fat and you can

00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:22,069
instead of having her brain try to get

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,350
glucose as its primary source of food it

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,030
can actually use this fat and convert it

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,010
into food so by putting her on this diet

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,409
you could have maybe ameliorate or

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,860
prevented some of these issues that she

00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:36,230
had growing up in the US totally

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,230
different situation remember no NHS um

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,700
no government funded health system of

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,200
consumer genetics so there's something

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,610
called 23andme of and this is where you

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
basically you're on a chip and you're

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,429
looking here oh this is what

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,020
chip looks like you're only looking at

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:52,460
the variable bits and you're opting into

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,320
research and when they originally

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,559
started your they were testing for 254

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,029
diseases and conditions and the FDA

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,380
knocks them back on that because they're

00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,000
not licensed to provide medical

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,150
diagnostics and sometimes you can get it

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,340
wrong and they were doing that so now

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,500
this only 30 60 50 I protest an ancestry

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,020
and this is somebody who published our

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,400
data and they'll tell you fun things

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,350
this is from their disclaimers so

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,000
genetic information can reveal that

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,059
someone you thought you were related to

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,200
isn't your biological relative think

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,640
about how well that can go down in a

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,510
family when you want oh let me do my

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,649
genetics for fun not and you can find

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,990
out stuff about disease you don't really

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,279
want to know and you're finding it out

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,929
not only for you but for everyone who's

00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,960
related to you so your mum might not

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:38,600
have signed up to find this stuff out so

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,950
yep and if you think that it's only in

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,630
the u.s. on you can nope it's here in

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,770
Australia as well and this is one of my

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,440
favorite things that happens with this

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,940
is prenatal diagnostic so for four

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,679
hundred fifty dollars you can actually

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,419
have prenatal testing for chromosome

00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,950
abnormalities for these syndromes which

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,929
is basically extra copies of chromosome

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,090
such a Down syndrome and other diseases

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,630
where you're basically taking a blood

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,490
sample from the mum and finding out

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,909
whether or not the fetus has this

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,830
disease and also now clinicians can with

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,480
of people who are traditional treating

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,460
people with rare diseases can directly

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,860
access and request genome sequencing to

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,909
be done at the Garden in New South Wales

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,950
for a fee so can be clinician and

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:17,419
patient driven and there's other

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,460
challenges in this system so first of

00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,140
all all the speed of the stuff is

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,399
running it's a major problem in the real

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,659
world but we've been developing all

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,860
these techniques in the ivory tower or

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,809
it doesn't matter to me whether my

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,770
analysis take a day or two but it does

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:30,140
when you're in the real world and

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:33,049
there's no pressure and incentive on me

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,320
as an academic to actually do this tools

00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,429
are not designed to work together and

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,809
that's a problem and our format they're

00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,610
horrible like the point if we can't

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,320
decide between the UK and Europe what

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:46,490
we're going to call chromosomes CHR one

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,140
or just one like it's that bad it's hard

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,610
to get the technical producer view

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,840
between centers for the sequencing stuff

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,460
to work we get different biases of

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,250
different centers and it's not always

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,840
easily to control and getting it wrong

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,559
can have really bad consequences because

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,700
you know if you classify a pathogenic

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,590
variant later

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,330
as benign in when you do not have

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,029
noticed a baby and you've terminated

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,100
that pregnancy that's not good similarly

00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,260
you can prove clued somewhere in the US

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,059
census a case study of someone that

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,529
looks like they have a mutation that's

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,029
going to prove you just was predisposed

00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,830
into cardiac failure and you can tell no

00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,850
you can't play football because we are

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,769
too scared you're going to just fall on

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,190
the field and then you find out it's

00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,600
wrong so this matters and of course you

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,580
need to have consistency in this

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,279
interpretation between pathologists and

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:35,299
doctors so you really need to make sure

00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:38,179
that you are getting consistent

00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,710
treatment of patients in the clinic no

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,230
matter what what dr. you see no matter

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,320
what pathologist you see and this is the

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,909
simple this is what we're doing now but

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,539
just to highlights and this is actually

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,860
the one slide about what I do so it's

00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:55,789
not as simple when I showed you the one

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,710
to one um actually when you go from DNA

00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,419
to RNA and then you make this RNA

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,049
molecule so this is our DNA this is

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:04,940
transcription RNA you don't actually get

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,440
that one to one you actually the cell

00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,419
actually cuts bits out in a process

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,740
called splicing and then it doesn't

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,600
start at the beginning read to the end

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,120
it only reads the middle bits so the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,529
protein it's only the middle bit and

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,090
we've got all this stuff called introns

00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:20,510
and all these stuff codon translated

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,159
regions which are there but don't make

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,510
for protein which means if we have

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,639
mutations and they're doing something we

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,630
have no idea what they are and to give

00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,730
you an idea of the extent of the problem

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,049
I've plotted down here this is the

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,610
latest human annotation that's available

00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,740
so I've downloaded last night engines

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,990
this is the latest greatest that we can

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,909
do this is the entire three billion

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,860
bases that I told you about this is the

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:44,330
proportion of protein coding sequences

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,169
for which the approach is about you know

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:50,000
amino acids breaking and stuff works and

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:52,070
this is the stuff that's in these

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,350
introns and in these end regions called

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,370
use yours this is the amount of stuff

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,190
that gets made for which we have

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,110
absolutely well very very very limited

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,159
if a lot almost none idea of how to

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,799
interpret mutations in these regions so

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,679
this is kind of the next step and what

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,269
I'm most excited about in this area so

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,980
additional resources um there's

00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:14,240
comprando called galaxy which has a

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,320
python backend for when you're starting

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
out when you can actually

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,740
with this type of data there's some

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,330
really cool YouTube videos from the road

00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,370
which is joining stupid harder than

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,620
mighty and genomic single it has some

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,240
there's a Python talk of a couple years

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,920
ago from you up last year from the US by

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,380
Titus brown with an example of how to

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,720
actually linking to an example of how to

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,360
run a bio bio framework on a trio data

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,920
set and bc bio itself which is another

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,630
Python framework to do this type of work

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,130
has sample analysis you can do here I've

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:47,330
put a bunch of instructions for how to

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,310
actually get data and what to do with it

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,290
but remember because there's a lot of

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,970
people in tech coming into this this is

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,520
still very hard correlation does not

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,810
imply causation biology is hard so don't

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,060
expect to come into any problem in

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,730
Sullivan in three months and every

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,680
single time we have gone in and try to

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,030
find something out in biology so when

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,850
book and said we've read the book of

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,040
life we're going to cure all diseases

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,170
fifteen years later I can tell you that

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,550
yes we read the genome and it's turned

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,200
out to be a lot more complicated a lot

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,200
more fun when we thought it was and

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,280
understanding this is addictive

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,140
beautiful and hard and we don't

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,270
understand most of it and this is

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,900
already in a hospital near you so this

00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,400
is really cool but finally because I've

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,870
shown you this the nature of this data

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,330
the fact that it is strength the fact

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,000
that it is actually a reduction problem

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,380
in fact it is a comparison problem you

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,960
as developers and people who understand

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,190
programming can actually understand both

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,740
the strengths and limitations leads

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,540
analysis like very few people and other

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,810
specialties can and because it is coming

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,100
out into the real world do have a play

00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,090
with this data do have a look what it

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,430
looks like because it's really really

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,450
cool and finally there's a bunch of I

00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,880
always that I haven't talked about

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,140
there's an algorithm to talk tomorrow

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,650
image analysis which is another major

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,270
area that we're there's a lot of cool

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,240
development happening and python is like

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,010
a major role in that you can if you want

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,990
to help out additional playing the data

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,150
contribute to the project for these

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,620
galaxies me see bio and there's a lot

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,600
and lot of other cool stuff that's going

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,680
on in terms of Kellogg denying the

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,120
diversity of life so using the

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,590
sequencing technologies not in the medic

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,730
which is to understand medical setting

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:28,070
but to understand what's out there to

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,299
using machine learning and analytics to

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,009
choose which areas too

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,259
so which areas in a country to designate

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:36,769
as national parks and to understand

00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:39,980
things like flu or disease Fred and I'd

00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:41,149
like to thank our team at the centenary

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,639
which is where I work which is between

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,830
urban hub Ralph Newton Sydney their lab

00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:47,960
and secure the future foundation for

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:53,619
suppressing for supporting my work and

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,619
thank you for listening and questions

00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:03,139
thank you very much sturdier we have

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,059
time for questions please speak clearly

00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:07,100
into the microphone so they can't be

00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:15,080
caught by I'm gonna go to the end of the

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:17,509
room my name is Ahmad and my question is

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,850
more biologic than data would be

00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:26,330
possible to cure all diseases one day if

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:28,759
this technology advances my answer I

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,409
think is no because as I've said the

00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,960
more we learn the more we realize we

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,429
don't understand and a lot of it is so

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,369
the diseases we're getting at right now

00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:39,320
are like the rare disease is a

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,899
relatively easy quote unquote because

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,999
they're one gene one thing is broken a

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:46,700
lot of more complex diseases sketches

00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:49,129
schizophrenia autism the neurological

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,869
diseases they're caused by issues with

00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:54,710
multiple genes and environmental factors

00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:57,859
and we still have no idea how to how

00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,019
that actually all works together both at

00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:02,690
the Milan a level at the molecular level

00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:06,590
as well as at the level of an organism

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,749
like a whole body and we really don't

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,539
even have like the models for that not

00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:14,119
so understanding disease is a disease in

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:17,029
that context isn't like it's too hard

00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,739
biology is too it's too noisy it's too

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,690
messy it's too hard and honestly the

00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:23,659
more I do biology the more I'm actually

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,159
amazed that we're not all broken like we

00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:27,259
often fundamentally as biology so you

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,720
don't think oh my god it's so amazing

00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:31,220
that an embryo develops from like sperm

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,080
and an egg and you get an embryo and you

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,409
get a person like there's so much that

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,999
can go wrong and how it actually why how

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:43,509
it works and the more we learn about it

00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:43,509
the more amazing it becomes so sorry no

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,720
doesn't you were gonna stop trying

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,299
thanks for the talk my question is like

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,609
so biology at the moment looks a lot

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:59,039
like information technology like we're

00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:02,580
kind of looking at biology as

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,730
information and data processing and

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:09,659
looks like it's kind of what you call

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,909
the this we're gaining speed like just

00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,980
like move slow or any other like

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:15,720
exponential so do you see that

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,029
exponential characteristic coming to

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,879
biology and where we are in that journey

00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:23,580
and do you expect a lot of like really

00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:28,049
good traction in that area so we're

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,970
already actually getting more data than

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,129
Moore's law would predict and this is

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,179
actually a lot of Micra last questions

00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:35,549
left they also have some data because

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,109
scientist and this is the paper from

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,820
some biologists who are like biology is

00:27:37,109 --> 00:27:41,100
going to generate the most data in 20-25

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,269
so but generating data and generate

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,190
understanding are two different things

00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,100
so yes we're generating ridiculous

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:50,190
amounts of data but we don't understand

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,739
a lot of it and at the end of the day

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,149
biology is about more than just strings

00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:56,220
like we have to interpret them and we

00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,539
have to go back to mechanisms and how

00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,850
stuff works in the real worlds because

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,100
it's not a string it's a series of

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,929
molecules and they're not hanging

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,850
somewhere in space or abstract they're

00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:07,409
actually in a Cell there's stuff around

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,559
them there's entropy going on there's

00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:12,809
chemistry going on there is you know the

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,629
body is interacting with the world as

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:19,679
well so it's it is a very very very

00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:22,139
complex system and yes we're getting

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,139
more data and yes we're building

00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:26,070
understanding and leaps and bounds but

00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:27,869
predicting what the future is going to

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,369
be in terms of discovery I don't know

00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:31,889
it's it's going to be amazing it's gonna

00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:33,330
be awesome it is awesome but where it's

00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,859
gonna go I don't know but the cool thing

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,359
is it's also going to the clinic right

00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:42,330
now one more question here yeah hi and

00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,669
so for someone like me who has very

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,200
little knowledge of biology if I was to

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,389
get in and play around with this data

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,549
what sort of evaluation strategies can I

00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:53,950
use if I don't have access to a lab or

00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:56,690
actual people to experiment on

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,670
so just for the record we don't actually

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,780
do experiments on people that's

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,340
unethical so to answer your question I

00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,710
think if I were starting out and I had

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,870
this on my slide there and i'll put my

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,300
slides up on my website said we'll be

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,980
there basically the first step i would

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,840
do is i would go in and try to go and

00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,310
look at find some data and the way you

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,530
find data is you go online there's a

00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,510
repository of papers called pubmed we're

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,490
all biological papers get deposited and

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,720
you have to go in and troll the de

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,920
method section and the links to a

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,450
database where they've actress toward

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,920
they're all data then you can go

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,540
download that data and use something

00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,310
like galaxy to first try to reproduce

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,630
these people's results so whoever's

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,710
results you're looking at try to

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,770
actually get the same thing they do

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,300
because most most scientific studies are

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,340
pretty accurate like we're doing a

00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,400
pretty good job for all retraction watch

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,780
so if you can reproduce it then you can

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,330
try to take some other data and try to

00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:51,080
do a similar analysis so basically take

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:52,070
it step by step and I think don't go in

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,810
thinking it's going to be three months

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,920
but definitely have a play with this

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,120
data because it'll give you a better

00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,890
understanding of what is actually

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:02,360
happening in the hospitals and clinics

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:04,220
right now and it's fun and beautiful we

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,170
have normal time for questions thank you

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,270
very much everyone and thank you dr.

00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:16,850
Daria vanish kina we have a present for

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:19,010
you we have a mug flying tram that

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,370
represents Melbourne so thank you very

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,370
much

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,210
