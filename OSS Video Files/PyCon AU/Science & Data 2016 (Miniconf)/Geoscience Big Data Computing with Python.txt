Python programming language is extensively used in Geoscience Australia (www.ga.gov.au) for scientific computing. In particular, a datacube system has been developed recently using Python as a core technology. The system manages petabyte-scale earth-observation satellite imagery datasets. And has enabled a wide range of applications such as the Water Observation from Space.

This talk is about how Geoscience Australia applies scientific computing (Python) to the big data challenges.

alright we'll go ahead and get started

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,450
again our last speaker of this session

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,099
is Fay junk Fay is the technical lead

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,559
and scientific computing at Geoscience

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
Australia and today he's going to tell

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,710
us about Geoscience big data computing

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:23,369
with Python good morning everyone it's

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,449
my great pleasure to come to Python and

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,449
give a talk

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:36,300
so me and my colleague is our regular

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,600
attendance of - up on Python my first

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,480
time come to Python Python was three

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,360
years ago in Hobart and this time I

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,450
thought I might give our talk so I

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,160
proposed a talk and and got upset it so

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,350
that's why I'm here to give this talk so

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,820
this talk is about Geoscience piqued our

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,230
computing with Python just interested

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,010
how many people knows about the

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,990
Geoscience Australia oh there's quite a

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:16,170
few sorry

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:18,720
so um Geoscience Australia this is not

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,670
why of my talk first I'll give an

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,420
introduction about Geoscience Australia

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,200
and then I will talk what kind of data

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,650
sets we have and what Big Data challenge

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,720
we have in Geoscience Australia

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:37,530
then I will focus on Australia

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,680
Geoscience data cube it's a it's it's

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,170
it's a system that has been developed

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,979
over yea developed in the past few years

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,130
so there's a story about how Geoscience

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,100
Australia that cube is constructed

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,579
developed and then I will have some time

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,430
to do some live demo using Jupiter

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,479
notebook and then I'll give some

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,920
concluding remarks so here's about

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:11,009
Geoscience Australia I better use our

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,660
official description this this this

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,530
official description actually change

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,690
over time

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,530
so this is a current one you can find

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,130
from a website Geoscience Australia is

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,620
Australia's preeminent public sector

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,440
Geoscience organisation we are the

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,860
nation's trusted adviser on on the

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,800
geology and geography of Australia we

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,550
apply Geoscience tech and technology to

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,209
describe and understand the earth for

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:47,550
the benefit of Australia so this is an

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:51,090
exact quote from our website and most

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:54,540
specifically io our core business and

00:02:51,090 --> 00:03:00,900
strategic priorities including four

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:05,190
areas the first one is as secure

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,760
Australia's resource as the first image

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,650
you can see we help to discover where

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,700
the minerals were the energy where the

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:17,280
energies petroleum and through doing

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,100
surveys and collecting data providing

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,430
pre-competitive data to industries and

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:28,220
partners the second priority area is is

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:31,560
the community's safety using earthquake

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:35,010
detection alert tsunami a tsunami

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:39,120
warning system you know using satellite

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,400
imagery to do the bushfire monitoring

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,049
push fire detection so that's the

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,019
community safety there is a secure

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,170
Australia water resource water resource

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,630
is a very precious thing in Australia

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:58,110
continent is is dry cunning relative

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,910
type continent so we need to know where

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,090
are the waters and how the water's

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,150
surface and groundwater interact and

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,600
find all the water resource and this one

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,560
is about managing Australia's marine

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,390
jurisdiction so we are not only study

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,530
and manage the Australia continent but

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:23,370
also its surrounding Marines and and

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,160
this is geography knowledge so that your

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,370
geography is about Road

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,030
about beauty's urban areas or the

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,210
features rivers so the mapping we have

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:43,880
all sort of mapping of Australia and

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:47,640
last one is is about geodesy all

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,400
Australia - geodesy network all the Tara

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,840
collection networks universe structures

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,430
so that's a previant reduction of

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,590
Geoscience Australia and as too many

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,450
people know already know well how about

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,270
Geoscience Australia it's a it's in

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:07,890
Canberra it's a it's a very nice beauty

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:12,390
with a free parking on site and there's

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:15,210
a very nice visitor center and you can

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,930
see a lot of rocks and minerals and

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,480
Petroleum's and even gold legit

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,230
in the foyer so if you have time to come

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,520
visit color camera come to visit us and

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,520
it will be very interesting so

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:40,080
scientific company system and system

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:45,180
engineering is a section within our it

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,690
was innovation branch and python is a

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,780
main programming language a very broadly

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,150
used in Geoscience Australia so so I'm

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:59,130
very happy to share this with you

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,130
particular part in is you is being used

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,730
in data acquisition and engineering

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:09,900
systems so when does the data collection

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,419
in the networks in the jo-jo in a

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,970
seismic next networks etc the ground

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,900
station we all use Python to control a

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,050
data collection systems so then when the

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:26,370
data is collected we need to process the

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,230
data and analyze the data and over the

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,810
years you have many data a lot of data

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:35,370
you we had used Python to manage the

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,919
data archive and then scientists can use

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,930
data to do modeling and the predictive

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,660
analytics

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,350
and all this computing actually takes

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,900
long time Ryan you know even

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:54,330
supercomputer so we need to use workflow

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,729
automation this is the can't develop a

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,850
lot of workflow automation is done in

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:04,680
Python programming language and also

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:07,770
recently we have team dedicated to cloud

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,820
computing which use Python to do

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:17,430
infrastructure as code to spin up Amazon

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:21,180
ec2 cost clusters so it's old onion

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:25,169
parties so we are by far perhaps the the

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:29,220
biggest party shop in in Canberra at

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:31,410
least in the public service sector so we

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,349
basically use parts everywhere you know

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,949
in people's PC desktop everyday Linux

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:42,199
servers cloud cloud computing

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:47,870
infrastructures and it's PC environment

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:51,110
so where are the big data in Geoscience

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,880
basically there are few areas I can

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,720
highlight here one is a satellite

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,669
imagery time series we collect satellite

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,070
every day virtually every day when

00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:05,120
satellite pass through Australia we have

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:10,169
a ground station in early spring to

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,780
acquire the data broadcasted to us you

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,289
need to the ground station so that time

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:19,979
every day you know overall past nearly

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:23,580
30 years and the second area is a

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,909
seismic survey data collection and you

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:32,849
know the bathymetry survey data recently

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:35,250
the mh370 higher plane is missing in the

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:40,250
ocean so we had a program to acquire a

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,839
lot of the ocean pathetic data tried to

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,079
discover where the plane load data are

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,260
so that's a big data collected and I got

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,950
in Geoscience Australia so all that and

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,850
also like point cloud digital elevation

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:59,940
model

00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:02,760
GIS mapping geodesic ball holes so all

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,020
together Geoscience Australia has a data

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,850
holding in nicotine get to para bytes at

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,160
least and this number of causes is

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:16,980
growing every day I said to Tutera

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,650
bodies the conservative estimation today

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,870
I'm going to focus mainly on the area of

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:27,930
Earth observation satellite imagery data

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,770
so there are two primary ways of obtain

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,620
or satellite imagery data one is a

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,190
colder so called real time and that

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,510
acquired at the ground station

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,510
Geoscience has a cross station in early

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,610
spring and his brain is a is a place in

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,580
the center of Australia so it's a ground

00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:50,610
station can cover pretty much everywhere

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,390
of the continent when satellite fly just

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,400
over Australia the other way is through

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,820
the non real-time system ik town

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,790
systematic download data from the

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,310
satellite operators operation agencies

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:11,730
such as new United States to urge of

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:14,190
geology survey and other European Space

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,130
Agency these are launched set right

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,770
operate satellite they have they they

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:25,680
they have set the server data acquired

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:29,870
through relaying so yeah so we also told

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,660
a lot of data from there so this

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,270
animation just show you a satellite

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,280
orbiting around Earth when it passes

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:43,220
Australia it will acquire imagery and

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,650
there is the satellite imagery we are

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,630
talking about

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,170
so the satellite actually orbited very

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,980
fast

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,910
it's a one-round is about 100 minutes

00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:00,150
and earth is itself rotating so this

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,640
couple dynamics make so this kind of

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:07,560
satellite

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:11,730
footprints on earth and you see that's a

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,720
or two paths and that's the image we

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:19,800
deal with and that was observation big

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,060
datasets and it's actually as I said we

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,860
begin to acquire satellite data since

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,560
more than 30 years ago and it's

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,670
gradually increasing and in recent years

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,610
it's a it's actually there's a huge jump

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:39,080
because of new satellites and the more

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,790
high quality higher resolution sensors

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,670
previously we have for example set Allah

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,089
Allen's said have twenty thirty thirty

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,610
metres spatial resolution nowadays with

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,790
a sentinel serious then you know one to

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,650
serious you have ten meters resolution

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,710
so the higher the resolution the more

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,260
data you will have and also spatial

00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,560
resolution another temporary solution

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,680
increased there's a hey Mariah eight

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,410
satellite which is a geostationary

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,020
satellite which stay in that on the

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,410
special relatively stationary to earth

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,920
and taking imagery every 10 minutes that

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,339
way you can monitor in the earth

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,230
bushfire all the natural natural natural

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:28,080
disaster happening on every 10 minutes

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,410
you can have a cetera Dimitri so I mean

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:36,450
people from very familiar to this kind

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:39,660
of satellite imaging and also yeah so

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,960
huge change took place in the past ten

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,480
years

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,140
I joined Geoscience Australia eleven

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,770
years ago and that time satellite data

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,370
was processed on users request user was

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,400
purchased by operators manually

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:59,850
delivered on types dvd/cd sometimes I

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,260
have TP sites it caused quite a bit of

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:07,020
money to the users and we used to I when

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,380
I first came I I heard that we have 1

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,230
million dollar revenue from Sirius

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,370
satellite imagery and nowadays it's no

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:20,010
longer disguise

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,390
so because the advance of technology the

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,750
entire data

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,750
God is a pre-processed into calibrated

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:31,740
her standard analyzers ready products

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,590
and stored online in the in petabytes

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:40,200
secure file system freely available to

00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:44,340
all users under Creative Commons license

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:47,300
so this gives birth to Australia

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:50,330
Geoscience data cube and I'm going to

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,830
focus there

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:57,840
so a GDC is a basic laser innovative

00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:02,060
solution to the big data challenge in

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,310
Earth Observation space in this area our

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:10,140
organization actually Ali is leading the

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:13,680
world and other inward space agency

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,890
organization like USGS European Space

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,920
Agency all come to use our collaborate

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,690
with us and use the ideas we have

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,030
developed the system we have developed

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:27,450
tried to do their problem so we are

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,750
leading with this area and the system

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,760
managers at deep time series of

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,860
observation are got data covering 30

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,620
plus years of and the how Australia

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,970
continent is content previously 10 years

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,520
ago basically people only study one area

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,580
one particular area nowadays we study

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,990
the whole continent with satellite

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:56,040
imagery and the system provides API to

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:59,460
enable users to explore search retrieve

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:05,670
analyze the big datasets and I am good

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:08,220
give a demo or later so and basically to

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:13,950
enable the development of a wide range

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:16,740
of applications in the system of hot

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,840
develop I yeah with Python as the main

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:26,250
technologies cause surprising maybe and

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:28,860
here quickly show you this video it's

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:34,320
studying okay okay people some kind of

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:36,640
idea what satellite imagery look like

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,600
when said that puzzle affiliates

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,810
basically tag image along its food path

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,860
and then over a period of time you will

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:52,360
cover the entire continent in the case

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,540
of set Lyle and said it takes 16 days to

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,920
cover every every area of Australia 16

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,410
did pastry visit in cycle and so you

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,740
know over many years we will cover the

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,980
continent many times that's why we have

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:12,910
a time series and the host radio science

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:17,100
data cube is basically organizes archive

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:21,399
and organized you know particular

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:25,690
Quietus smud way and divide all the

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,089
imagery data into cells in this case

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,940
first version is one degree by one

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,640
degree cells and country was using a

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,660
different projection called Ava's conic

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:41,649
projection which is 100k meter 100

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:44,890
kilometers cells so it's like terabytes

00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:49,290
partitioning this is databases petabyte

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:51,670
scale we partition it in space the

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,459
advantage of doing this is when you

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,399
participate in your data in already in

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:01,000
space people can search it retrieve it

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:05,010
very quickly easily so that some that's

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:10,660
the idea of a database management system

00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:13,990
applied in a spatial temporal context so

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:19,660
basically that's some that's a video to

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:22,089
show you that Alacoque continue at some

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,740
this system is actually many years in

00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,439
the making

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,650
started in five six years ago

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:32,700
with a project well which I was deeply

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,220
in Union vote it's called a lot

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,070
unlocking Landsat archive basically they

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,590
say is a multi-million dollar funded

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,320
project because people say the potential

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:47,530
of these are got data so they fund the

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,070
project to persist let's process 10

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:54,820
years of our

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:58,270
guys ten years ago from 2010 to 2014 to

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:04,360
2010 and then make it available to all

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:06,610
users communities so that was stung and

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,730
basically done over exceeding the

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,010
stakeholders expectations the world

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,580
wanted us to done Ted to persist 10

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:20,680
years week actually persist 12 years so

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:24,010
it's um on time on budget and basically

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:27,790
it was done with the help of national

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,250
computer infrastructure NCI at a new

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,520
that basically is a collaboration

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,600
partner in this multi-million dollar

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:40,600
project and we were using not even this

00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:44,820
last generation supercomputer which was

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,560
in value I think currently use radio and

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,230
we needed to set up a special Linux

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,920
cluster to to process the one hand over

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,260
100 terabyte of data and that because of

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,380
that time the software was written not

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,630
ready to you to be used in supercomputer

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:07,030
cluster you had to be customized beaut

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:09,550
cluster then the it - I wrote lots of

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,370
Python script to automate workflow and

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:15,970
even that took a lot of time and pain to

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:19,090
process the archive but it was done with

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,100
the help have power of Python automating

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:24,060
things and basically you let the

00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,830
computer cluster running days and weeks

00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:33,640
about three months time to process the

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:36,850
archive technology used in a GDC Python

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,210
modules I would like to highlight this

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,180
this is not exclusive list but the major

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,510
Python modules like GDL roster I all the

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,840
shape shape shape like geo pandas non

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:54,970
parce I hide a major work how workhorse

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,350
we also use a SQL alchemy to connect

00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:01,389
with database back-end database Postgres

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,789
netcdf is there is a major

00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:07,479
five format we are using currently and

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:11,109
the visualization Jupiter notebooks X

00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:15,369
array and dusk and my my colleague

00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:18,219
Andrew Hicks will give a talk on Akari

00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:24,849
and I'll task in afternoon should be

00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:27,999
very interesting so at this point just I

00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:31,269
quickly knocked up this architecture to

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:33,389
show you that work the process flow the

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:39,279
the structure of the AGC

00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:41,339
datacube and basically how we how we do

00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,359
the data cube is that starting from here

00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:47,019
draw datasets

00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:50,229
it's the Agra data and they'd have to be

00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:53,200
persist into standard imagery data and

00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:57,339
then ingest into the file system and the

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,389
file system of the Tara files the

00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:03,599
imagery have to be indexed and the

00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:09,809
indexed story in the Postgres database

00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:14,320
tables and then we have a package of

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:18,549
Python modules we call native API

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,909
interface to allow user to research and

00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:24,219
retrieve data from the this data cube

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:27,309
and then you do all your kind of

00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:30,519
applications whether it's a detect water

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:33,959
or whether you want to do any kind of

00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:37,539
vegetation land land land cover change

00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:40,659
applications in the stand alone programs

00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:43,809
or in batch jobs or you're using

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:46,719
interactive computing with for example

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:49,749
Jupiter notebook then you produce some

00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:52,719
derived products digital products you

00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:55,690
can publish it and you can ingest it

00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:57,309
back into the data cube system then

00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,589
other people can retrieve and use it

00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:02,049
they don't have to derive it again so

00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:09,190
that's the overall structure and

00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:18,369
workflow of data cube not ten on time

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:22,149
okay so I think so this is a Jupiter

00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:25,570
notebook I'm not running it in my own

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:28,269
laptop this notebook is running in and

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,599
say infrastructure and I just remotely

00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:35,529
access it the way to access it is I had

00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:39,340
to use a sh client to log into the

00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:43,299
system use a ton tunneling method so

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:45,940
that I can use localhost actually

00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:48,729
accessing the NCI infrastructure and I

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,759
also would like to set aside notes

00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:52,899
there's some security issue with the

00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,729
Jupiter notebook

00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:58,119
whether it is running in your own laptop

00:22:54,729 --> 00:23:01,450
it's fine no other people access it once

00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:04,629
you are running in a shared server that

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:09,340
default Jupiter notebook running in part

00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:13,210
8 8 8 8 8 actually can be accessed by

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:16,419
other users just like yourself so best

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,149
to use a your hood which is you have to

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:21,580
set up some HTTP secure accession and

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:24,669
set a password in this case you see I

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,649
have a lock lock button this is because

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:32,440
I am logging beforehand and okay so

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:35,289
security thing just to remind people who

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,840
are otherwise people access it and just

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:43,979
like you you can't do anything

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,200
so demonstrate this is a notebook I

00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:53,009
first thing is basically have I can have

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,009
an image inserted into here run it life

00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:00,220
you already see this picture it's about

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:02,649
architecture and some references about

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,389
we have kick it up have a look of a

00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:09,269
Geoscience Tala cube github and a lot of

00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:14,710
open source started no open source

00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:17,589
repository there and computing basically

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,589
the first thing is to import some Python

00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:23,009
modules whether it's some hard what's

00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,009
happening

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:33,330
whether it's cyber or number and in this

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:38,740
case I also dynamically insert a path

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:42,160
which with a GGC version two source code

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:49,420
here so this is a another feature of

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:53,679
patent law to set a dynamic import path

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:56,650
so that's successful then I begin to

00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:02,200
have that access of object constructor

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:06,250
that access object and you can say with

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:08,110
this what you can do is to ok least you

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,300
can list the product story in the

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:17,380
telecom this is really a derecho Beyonce

00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:22,290
and so I'm going to draw this sell list

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,290
all the products stored in the data cube

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:33,309
and here I just just the first few if I

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:37,030
let it all go it will have hundred of

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:39,820
lines and the measurement measurement is

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:42,040
about acetylide pants that I've mesh

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:47,440
satellite imagery you know in a simple

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:50,230
sense is like RGB image it's related to

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,900
the magnetic electromagnetic waves the

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:58,470
sensories is instead is try to acquire

00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:02,590
data so this lists all the satellite

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:07,179
different centroid band at blue red blue

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:09,640
green and blue or the band some

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,620
basically information about the

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,900
satellite image with the data stored in

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:20,530
the data cube alright and the next cell

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:25,660
okay I'm going to focus on a spatial

00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:28,750
temporal extent special is is defined by

00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:32,020
the letter longitude and latitude this

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,179
area I choose come from that cover the

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,180
camera region and I will because I will

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,950
show you

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,510
Kember that Willie Lake Burley Griffin

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:44,840
from satellite imagery so with a

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:48,980
temporary period offer basically 2015

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,170
and and I'm going to do the Landsat

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,620
eight which is the newest surveillance

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:57,710
and serious we have less than five

00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:01,630
already Auto series to after 25 years in

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:04,310
a space let's say seven is a is really I

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:07,730
have some issues Desiree the was

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:15,800
launched at three years ago maybe so its

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:18,560
newest I run this cell this may take up

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,100
to a minute because it's going to the

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:27,500
data cube and retrieve one year data

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:35,290
archive covering that space of temporal

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:39,470
region but story that well fast okay and

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:42,080
this is basically the data as you can

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:48,400
see this is retrieved data is X array

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:55,310
data set and it has some dimension of 75

00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:57,940
75 slices of settled imagery with X & Y

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:06,020
dimension basically latitude longitude

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:09,260
who is the special great and all the

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:11,990
parasites include curry green red

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,590
near-infrared shortwave Eva read all

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:21,170
those is terminology of satellite way

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:26,000
and so I don't have to show you these

00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:28,820
things basically okay so with the status

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,690
that you can look at what's the minimum

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,150
time what's the maximum time as we are

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:39,050
interesting the Year 2015 its start from

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:43,070
January and the last scene is basically

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:48,100
in November 26 okay so that's that was

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:48,100
in the data cube all right

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:56,700
to show you some settle via satellite

00:28:50,820 --> 00:29:01,170
imagery here and is this I when this

00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:06,920
function function when this function to

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:09,780
retrieve RGB imagery as individual slice

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,700
and I basically define a function in a

00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,370
cubit a notebook I think it's a good

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,320
practice also to to define some

00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:19,380
functions instead of repeat every time

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:28,500
so I just define a function called show

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:33,150
image for it yester and then I can use

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:38,610
this function to show an image this one

00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:46,440
show the first image that's red gray

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:49,710
blue that's that redeeming okay and next

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:54,750
one is a secure image I'm going to show

00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:58,580
you a color image that one make our GB

00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,580
image this one is more interesting

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,100
oh this one okay this color image you

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:15,370
will clearly show you the camera region

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:19,660
and okay so you see the Lake Burley

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:22,510
Griffin I mean whether it's a clear or

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,490
not from your husband yes that's that

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,350
that's the camera region that's RGB

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:32,050
image okay

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,430
yeah but demonstration is here if people

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,380
are interested in more things you can

00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,040
come to me and I can show you this is

00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:42,370
available time okay it's because it's

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,850
funny in the computer you'll see our

00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:50,070
supercomputers so to wrap up my talk

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:59,380
because of the time let me just quickly

00:30:50,070 --> 00:31:01,360
go through some slides lots of

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:07,630
applications can be developed on the

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:10,540
data cube and I would like to

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:13,090
acknowledge really our our crabbin the

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:19,000
partner climate collaborator as they i

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:22,210
it provides supercomputing and see so

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,690
and other organizations collaborating

00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:28,150
with us on the static cube system

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,310
concluding remarks we basically talking

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,350
about software development in this kind

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:36,400
of scale we need to have some good

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:38,470
practice here's a use github of course

00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,250
everybody know continuous integration

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:44,590
unit testing and source code

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:48,730
documentation to management magical

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:50,770
system so in summary pison has been

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,730
successfully used in geo size big data

00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,270
problems it's a really big data or

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,810
petabyte scale

00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:02,020
I mean it's increasing cousin is very

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:05,260
suitable for geo data computing from

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:08,170
geography to seismic geology geodesy

00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:12,970
every area in Geoscience Australia we

00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:14,980
use Python and we have a Geo data model

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,620
into your statistics machine learning

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:22,270
predictive analytics currently going

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:25,510
and in Geoscience Python had a bright

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:28,690
past I have been there 11 years so no

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,760
problem I can testify that and it looked

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:35,520
like it will have an even brighter

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:38,710
future so lastly what is the procedure

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:42,010
AG do you say Austria Geoscience eyelid

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,490
cube currently continues to be an active

00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:48,510
high priority program well resposta

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:53,049
with a strong team of Python developers

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:56,049
doing the heavy lifting lifting the long

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:59,620
term objective is to develop the AG DC

00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:03,370
system into an integrated Geoscience Big

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,169
Data framework where we can develop a

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:10,720
things like integrating the earth all

00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:12,909
kind of integrated a lot of people

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,330
analyze where them where those results

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:19,690
what is where only Australia continent

00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:23,039
and virtual geophysics Laboratory which

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:26,440
will be interesting to how kind of user

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,600
research community to bring your own

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,049
algorithm plug-in and they use the real

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:36,100
data to predict or analyze to see the

00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:40,620
changes in the joseon Geoscience so with

00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,620
