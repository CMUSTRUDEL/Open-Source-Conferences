Python programming language is extensively used in Geoscience Australia (www.ga.gov.au) for scientific computing. In particular, a datacube system has been developed recently using Python as a core technology. The system manages petabyte-scale earth-observation satellite imagery datasets. And has enabled a wide range of applications such as the Water Observation from Space.

This talk is about how Geoscience Australia applies scientific computing (Python) to the big data challenges.
