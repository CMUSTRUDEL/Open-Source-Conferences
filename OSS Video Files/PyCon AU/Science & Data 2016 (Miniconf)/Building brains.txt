The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an open-source scientific software written in
Python for advanced simulations of complex brain dynamics. TVB can be used in
a client-server configuration, such that its web-based interface can be
accessed remotely, or as a standalone cross-platform Python library through a
scripting interface. 

In this talk I will begin by briefly explaining the motivations and science 
behind TVB. This will be followed by a description of TVB's architecture and 
main functionalities, including: simulation of neural activity; modification 
and visualization of brain connectivity and network dynamics; and, analysis 
of time-series. Lastly, I will show you that getting started with brain 
simulations is just one Jupyter notebook away.

With TVB you might not be able to build smart brains (yet), but you can build
one of the most realistic approximations to the physics of a human brain.
