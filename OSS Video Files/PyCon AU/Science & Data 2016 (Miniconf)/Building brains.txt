Title: Building brains
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Science & Data 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Paula Sanz-Leon
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/33/view_talk
The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an open-source scientific software written in
Python for advanced simulations of complex brain dynamics. TVB can be used in
a client-server configuration, such that its web-based interface can be
accessed remotely, or as a standalone cross-platform Python library through a
scripting interface. 

In this talk I will begin by briefly explaining the motivations and science 
behind TVB. This will be followed by a description of TVB's architecture and 
main functionalities, including: simulation of neural activity; modification 
and visualization of brain connectivity and network dynamics; and, analysis 
of time-series. Lastly, I will show you that getting started with brain 
simulations is just one Jupyter notebook away.

With TVB you might not be able to build smart brains (yet), but you can build
one of the most realistic approximations to the physics of a human brain.

okay thanks for bearing with us as we

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,299
get everything set up our next speaker

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,950
is Paula sons Leon she's a postdoctoral

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,260
research associate in the school of

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,670
physics at the University of Sydney

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:20,550
please welcome Paula and her talk

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:22,590
building brands thank you very much well

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,859
my name is Paula and today I will be

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,140
talking about how to build around using

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,890
the virtual brain simulator which is a

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,780
button library yes I'm going to go

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,550
through a lot of content to deal with

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,210
the science on the technical aspects of

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,730
this toolbox in 25 minutes and it's the

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,250
content that you should learn over six

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,440
months maybe so please hold onto your

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,579
chest fasten your seatbelts and just

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,660
enjoy the flight so the virtual brain is

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,100
a scientific software for simulating the

00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,739
electrical activity of the whole brain

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,280
and it's written as you might guess yes

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,650
in Python and it also has a web

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,080
interface or graphical user interface

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,909
and this was done in collaboration with

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,939
a software development company code map

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,310
based in Romania we also use some other

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,759
nice tools for instance to like Hudson

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,159
to build the stable releases we also use

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,890
a place in JIRA for all the project

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,170
management and tasks and we have the

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,710
open source code available and get help

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,540
so you can go and check it so what is

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,880
that we're trying to do here so the

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,340
science of the virtual rain we are not

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,680
trying to mow every single neuron in the

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,799
rain but actually the coordinated

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,259
activity of a group of neurons yes when

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,299
this nursin are working together there

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,970
are certain signals that are strong

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,640
enough to actually be captured by some

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,439
electrodes on the surface or your scalp

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,829
and this is called electrons a

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,170
photography or ed right and there are

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,469
many things we can do young and tell you

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,659
about this electrical activity yes so

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,899
because we were trying to do this and

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,480
it's not only a new network simulator we

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,900
said that to simulate the electrical

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,030
activity of the whole brains

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,159
different groups of neurons across the

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,579
brain working together or doing whatever

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,470
they want yes we needed a simulator yes

00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:25,420
that could accumulate different

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,400
properties of the human brain and some

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,890
of them are more and most important

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,310
features of the rain are the wrong shape

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,799
under wiring of rain and so this path

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,010
connecting for instance your the back of

00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,319
your head with the front of your head so

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,689
while we have been mildly successful in

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,280
extracting this wiring of the brain in

00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,099
science and actually using for

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,920
simulations when it comes to Friendship

00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,409
for this and the theoretical approaches

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,200
and even other simulators having been

00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:57,940
very successful unnaturally they

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,220
approximate the rain with the line so

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,019
one dimension but sometimes they bend

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,470
the languages well a circle is turn off

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,299
more similar to a range shape but more

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,849
sophisticated approaches go to two

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,760
dimensions so they have a square shape

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,620
this is like in the 1500 when they

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,650
thought that the earth was kind of a

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,160
plane and stuff like a stream well but

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,319
if we've been this to the object yes

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,209
trying to match the vertical edges on

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:31,359
the risotto edges do you know what we

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:33,370
get anyone that yes so I don't know pet

00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,079
or a donut brain and that's how some

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,549
mathematical models and simulators

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,370
actually approximate the shape of your

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,470
brain but we want something like that so

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,269
all compared with you don't fold it so

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,870
it looks like a walnut or a cauliflower

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,729
whatever you prefer yeah so this is what

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,120
we do in the ritual rain we take a

00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:56,530
person well I don't some in the doctors

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,540
through a subject and we do like a 3ds

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,879
country obtained the structure imagine

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,609
like the actors that get scan so they

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,829
can get their CGI representation well

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,799
something like that and we put that into

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,319
the visual brain with that we let us

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,239
know about the dynamics yes so this

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,049
electrical activity that is going on

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:20,409
every single second of our lives yes

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:23,710
until we don't even but anyway you might

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:25,480
be wondering is this is this virtual

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,870
brain intelligent

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,870
does it think oh that's it learn well no

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,090
sorry sorry to disappoint you not yet I

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,480
am I haven't worked around that problem

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,190
yet but actually thank you for the

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,230
virtual brain as a kind of flight

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,020
simulator or whether simulator if you

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,470
want but for brains yes it lets you

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:52,030
study different scenarios for instance

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,620
and um dude for instance to poke at this

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,560
virtual rain without having to actually

00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,280
poke at the subjects right so that kind

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,770
of good lets you practice but even

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,260
though this brain doesn't think or it

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,420
doesn't learn us we might understand

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,130
those concepts there are many things we

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,370
can get out of the electrical activity

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,200
of the brain this activity has

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,140
particular signatures that correspond to

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,890
brain States yes or to some something a

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,300
person is doing like sleeping or using a

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,490
hundred percent of your brain that's

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,170
called epilepsy and it's not good don't

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,480
tell you Hollywood movies to tell you

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:32,380
otherwise yes or when we're really

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,500
working yes so and this is worth the

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,810
applications of the virtual rain come or

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,150
are the potential applications we can do

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,670
one is to study the abnormal activity of

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,640
the ring as I say non-invasive Liam we

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,370
don't have to to use actually subjects

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,500
or real furnishings to do that we can

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,660
also study the officials of drugs

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,870
because if we have the laws of evolution

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,240
so basically equations is on how drugs

00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,620
diffusing the brain tissue we might

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,740
understand how the electrical activity

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,480
is effective and another application is

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,000
about selling tissue damage and there

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,410
are two main points in tissue damage one

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,460
is what are the effects of a stroke

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,110
because that's that tissue is dead it

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,150
doesn't do anything else and it's like

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,070
you have a big blob of like doing

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,040
nothing in your brain and the other

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,160
application is for epilepsy actually

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,410
sometimes in epilepsy the only solution

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,570
is to remove a chunk of your ring to

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,210
bring balance to your brain again and

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,010
actually you drive out the surgeons

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,200
ordinations practice a little bit

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,050
because they will get one chance and

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,629
only one chance of fixing your brain

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,870
let's go now to buy some technical

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,810
things I mentioned that no I didn't

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,030
mention well this base library runs on

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,030
linux marks on Windows it's open search

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,270
with a license GPL version 2 and it runs

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,580
runs in Python yet too so yeah I know

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,889
it's kind of legacy code now Python 3

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,639
but if anyone wants it's open source you

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,770
can contribute important vital trade yes

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,520
they main cool they may need libraries

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,349
for scientific or is non pass ipod leads

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,099
we also use psychic plans for some

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:17,199
analysis and i mentioned that there is a

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,889
web interface so there there are some

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,139
services and a vacuum storage on the

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,229
communication to the webbing between the

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,419
back end and the web interfaces done by

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,060
an application in cherry pie we use h5

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,039
to store large data sets that we produce

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,560
some there's some other packages and

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,319
tomorrow technologies like WebGL and b3

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,919
that ways for the web interface to put

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,469
it into a more nice nicer diagram we

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,900
have the web interface or different user

00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,690
interfaces in particular the graphical

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,520
one it communicates by a cherry pie

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,949
application because the virtual brain

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,009
could actually work the vacuum in a

00:07:53,949 --> 00:08:00,159
server and then if multiple users access

00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:04,240
the application via web browser which is

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:07,509
kind of late and there is oops so it's

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,009
not absurd there is a flow manager this

00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:14,469
is this is alive there is flow managers

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,930
that are organized your operations and

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,210
some other things that you can do within

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,580
the interface and it connects to the

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,960
database on yet to the vacuum storage

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,060
that stores your your simulations but

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,180
you don't have to use the web interfaces

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,949
if that's not your thing you can use the

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,779
scripting interface and we have two

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:36,909
flavors for the scripting interface one

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,919
is three button idol and the other one

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,719
is through Jupiter notebooks that the

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,279
previous speaker kindly explain what

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,870
those were so but this still lets you

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,329
use all these flow managers on the

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,900
vacuum storage but if you don't like

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,790
that racism so flow managers and

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,070
they were you don't have to use that and

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,590
you can use the virtual rain as a simple

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:03,540
Python module like import DVD and that's

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:05,730
it so now I'm going to explain with more

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,350
about what these data types are on the

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,550
scientific simulator and what's inside

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,190
apologize for the figure doesn't look

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,610
very good well the simulator actually

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,620
has different modules one is the core

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,380
population dynamics which is basically

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,970
giving you different equations that you

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,360
can use to produce this electrical

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,360
activity or seem similar activity yes

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,370
our knowledge speakers well inside in

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,860
sometimes we don't know where something

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,110
from way some random fluctuations come

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,660
from so we add noise and we get some

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,610
random fluctuations and then we have

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,100
numerical integrations I won't go into

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,650
the details if you know and when I say

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,710
Euler what I'm talking about that's good

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,050
if not it doesn't matter and then we

00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:56,820
have a model that is cool monitors these

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:59,640
monitors actually are imitations of the

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,770
real world recordings like EG i

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,190
mentioned or functional magnetic

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,780
resonance imaging if you know what I'm

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:11,910
saying well we can actually produce

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:14,400
those type of signals but the simulator

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,160
also use these data types what are these

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,880
data types are there basically

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,830
structured annotated classes yes it's

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,450
the vocabulary and the language of the

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,300
virtual brain and is the way it

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,240
communicates also with the different

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,060
interfaces and inside each of these data

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,370
types we have actually a component of

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,440
the rain one of those is the structural

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,720
connectivity so that skeleton and all

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,670
the pathway is going from one region of

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,440
the rain to the other the cortical

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,500
surface which is the shape of the rain

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,600
that I was telling you earlier and seem

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,830
stimulation patterns these are basically

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,400
a equation they find with like some

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:59,580
bowling equations and we can get away

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,499
with simulating different stimulation

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,109
protocols if you want to test like

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,869
I know adding some electricity to rain

00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,879
if you want or some other things that

00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:14,139
let's not talk about like torturing

00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:17,669
brains anymore so moving on i will show

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:21,399
you some some crowd just for the sake of

00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:23,109
completeness and this is a data type yes

00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,659
it's called surface and it will contain

00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:28,209
for instance the cortical surface inside

00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,939
there will be different properties of

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,999
these data types like wall vertices

00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,309
triangles and so on and each of these

00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:39,219
properties as well has different little

00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:41,199
attributes like the labels I'm also a

00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:43,599
type and very very important

00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,479
documentation because then all these

00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:50,139
strings are grabbed by stinks and you

00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:54,699
end up with a very nice website with

00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:57,009
documentation so these data types have

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:01,089
our basically classes that have a

00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:04,959
diamond diamond structure meaning that

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:07,149
it lets us use multiple returns and I

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,119
know this is not exclusive to python but

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:13,119
is so easy to do it with pardon so what

00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:16,749
is it happens is in one in one big class

00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:18,789
we can have methods that course that

00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:21,099
work with the framework so this

00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:24,009
framework orchestrate and organize the

00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:26,739
services and with the scientific or so

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,720
they can work together or we can split

00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:31,629
them and then you can use juicy

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,659
scientific but without using all the

00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:38,220
services another example of a class is

00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:40,479
the model here also with different

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,349
properties and annotations on

00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:47,349
documentation the dog strength of a

00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:50,379
derived class yes hear of a mobile very

00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:53,889
important to have a detailed description

00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:57,249
including equations if you if you are

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,559
doing mathematics and its own we have a

00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:02,739
particular parameter you say it it's a

00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:05,499
float array and we are a default value

00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:08,439
it's important to have default values in

00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:10,989
these applications we also have ranges

00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:12,970
that when this these parameters have

00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:15,939
physical units like meters or heating

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,849
kilograms or zone we can actually use

00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,859
ranges to constraint the value of these

00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:22,869
parameters because out of that range

00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:27,389
well it doesn't make sense imagine that

00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:29,709
you know they had this size well I'm

00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,629
sure I can show you some of the

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,599
questions we actually use and this is a

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:37,839
good example it goes at the beginning we

00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,459
were using just not not buying we did

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,019
all the operations with non point but

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,839
because these were fairly simple

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,599
equations we saw that we can use nuñez

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,089
and if you know that package is for

00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:51,489
symbolic operations and it really speeds

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,619
up operations quite a lot there are some

00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:55,989
moles of their it more complicated so we

00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:59,679
can't really use mimics but wait where

00:13:55,989 --> 00:14:01,899
possible we did yes so interfaces and

00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,439
pretty pictures now yes we are not that

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,720
far from landing so the web interface

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:10,449
looks more or less like this we have a

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,149
place where we can edit this brain

00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:15,489
wiring like a big disconnection here and

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,589
it will translate into cutting some of

00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:19,769
these connections every cube he is

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,659
representing one particular brain region

00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,399
and we have some our brain visualizers

00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:27,759
to see the activity of the brain where

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,309
what's happening everywhere and as I

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,989
mentioned before we can select certain

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:35,559
point where we want to apply a

00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:40,929
particular stimulus but let's see

00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:48,119
actually the real thing I'd be something

00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:50,859
yesterday for you yes so if you soon

00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:54,129
what you will see is not nervous but

00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:57,819
it's the white wine is this triangular

00:14:54,129 --> 00:15:00,009
mesh yes that it's actually quite widely

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,049
used in computer graphics to render I

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:07,179
know trolls elves and some other things

00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:09,879
in some video games third that's the

00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,589
interface I told you that the web

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,079
interface is not the only interface we

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,629
have all the demos and tutorials come

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,569
under the under the form of Jupiter not

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:23,139
i can see if i still have time because i

00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:25,869
don't always in european so again so we

00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:29,950
have different demos from very simple

00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:32,200
cases to more complex cases

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,780
like mulling epilepsy and some are

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,200
tutorials that show you how to perform

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:42,340
certain analysis yes on the resulting

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,410
simulations on data sets and let's go on

00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,100
three one because I promised the

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,750
organizing committee that I would have a

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,800
working them and it was running

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,040
yesterday and you can see that still

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,680
running but I I won't execute every

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,930
single cell because the simulations to

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,090
take a few minutes to run in particular

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:08,830
if you consider that that surface have

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:11,170
over 16,000 vertices yes so what we have

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,750
here is we are not remove any simulation

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:17,110
with cortical geometry or invest fancy

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,190
words it's actually a simulation of your

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,020
whole brain so we need certain

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,640
components for these molds and you will

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,640
see that at the end we'll have only

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,580
about 20 lines of code to run a complete

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,230
brain stimulation the first thing import

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,470
all the tools from the virtual reign as

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,540
a regular python module yes number if

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,090
you are going to do some all kinds of

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,130
things the model the mo of local

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,080
dynamics this is going to tell you how

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,300
that activity is going to evolve in time

00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,250
which is basically a set of differential

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,540
equations if you have buggering

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,330
mathematics you know what I'm talking

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,370
about we call them all one in particular

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,560
there is a collection of models that

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,190
have been using in your science and

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,740
quite a lot yes well I'm me I

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,750
have to to number two ingredients it's

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,060
like connectivity yes this is the

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,750
pathways in connecting different regions

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,480
of your brain and we low we have a

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,490
default and hearing settings pip because

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,140
actually signals don't propagate isn't

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:22,420
instantaneously even in the rain yes the

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:28,050
second one is the cortex not all that

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:30,610
are folded shape yeah two lines of code

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:33,190
the third ingredient is the coupling

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,960
because i'm setting local dynamics

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,880
meaning how this group of neurons is

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,580
going to behave how this one is going to

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,590
behave and it's a something that couples

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,450
them together and is going to determine

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,279
how they interact with it

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,080
other and this is given by a function

00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,610
that we call coupling yes integrator as

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,799
I mentioned if you know about numerical

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,039
integration methods you know that you

00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,159
need this in order to obtain at the end

00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:03,880
squiggly lines and the fifth ingredient

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,740
is the monitors so how what is that you

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,200
are going to record other neural

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,820
activity or something more elaborated

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,980
like functional MRI yes we define

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,960
different type of monitors some of them

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,360
will just sample or take samples or in

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,059
time hours they're going to average a

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,330
bunch of vertices of the surface into

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,909
something so we have less dimensions to

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,870
analyze at the end and EG well it

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,149
actually produces the the signal that

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:40,809
could be recorded from from a subject

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:42,730
and the other step is just to go and

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,919
simulate all these components are

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,529
brought together into an hour class

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,850
which is well in this case it's one

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:51,840
instance of that class which is the

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:54,250
simulator and this simulator is going to

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,990
iterate it's going to put all those

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,240
together they're going to communicate

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,500
with each other are not p.m. you will

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,940
have brain activity the output is

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,149
basically to tell you what's inside the

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,649
simulator yes I know the components and

00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:13,870
here i have the simulation it's done in

00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:16,360
a followed and it's not moving forward

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,070
because this is structure instead of

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,169
having just something that says go run

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,360
run the simulation let's stop the

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:25,210
simulation may be revised the parameters

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,789
or maybe apply something new yes and

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:32,260
then continue resume the simulation so

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:34,600
that's why we have this explicit fall to

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,580
to run the simulations and I can show

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,059
you even more pretty pictures now but in

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,850
Jupiter notebooks so we have some data

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:45,460
so time series at the end and i'm using

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,929
matlab leave and plot lee or plot line

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,210
on how to pronounce that one so what we

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,730
have this is the matplotlib version is

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,710
some brain activity there are some

00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,460
oscillations day and then it goes flood

00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,169
this is no

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,330
there's a dead brain and we actually

00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,950
like this type of dynamics very much in

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,860
your science there who fixed point

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,779
dynamics but I'm not going to tell you

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,529
more about that you can with lots of

00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:14,770
papers and here is the same to you but

00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,679
with a plug Lee and what I like about

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:20,500
this particular tool box that this is

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,289
the part for Python it adds a very nice

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,260
layer of interactivity here you can see

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:29,190
basically the values yes the the

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:35,740
coordinates time on the value of the

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:38,710
y-axis and it lets you soon so I know if

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,279
someone likes bulky org okay it's fine

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,610
but I found that this blood lay there

00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:51,010
really and they're really good and is it

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:54,360
easy to use okay so on I think that's

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:58,000
all I came to show you even more brave

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,880
with blood Lee with loudly you can have

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,250
this interactivity and also in three

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,750
dimensions in your Jupiter notebook you

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,899
know see what's going on on each

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,980
coordinate sorry I think moves and so on

00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:15,100
this I prepared just for that so I go

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,690
back to the presentation now and um

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,700
sorry that was supposed to come links

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,679
useful links if you want to just take

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,929
pictures to its go visit the links and

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,850
so on the verge of rainn.org is where

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,370
you will find the stable releases for

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,440
all the platforms you will also find the

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,980
rest of names of the research things

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,630
that were involving the scientific part

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,490
papers and so on you you need to

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,909
register but it's only for statistical

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:46,120
purposes we don't send spam or anything

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:48,610
they open the the sources are on github

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,409
then in dogs well we have all the

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,360
documentation including tutorials on how

00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:56,320
to use the web interface how to use a

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,240
scripting interface and so on on three

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,309
years ago a google web squeeze all

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,830
organized and they well many people

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,299
interact there is always someone that

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,789
will answer your questions where it's

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:09,580
about i go to a syntax error from

00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:10,260
baikonur this program is not working i

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,910
don't know

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,830
or just Laura hello just just up and I

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:28,260
thank you for your attention we just

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:32,280
landed okay Thank You Paula for a great

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,980
talk through you and we have a whole

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:48,060
bunch of time for questions so if anyone

00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:51,150
has a question about hi impressive

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,820
presentation thank you my question is

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,200
like the actual brain is quite huge my

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,510
understanding is like four trillion

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,790
neurons versus the simulations are

00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,800
usually quite small like I think you

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,960
mentioned something like 16,000 you're

00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,760
on to something so my question is like

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,520
how do you how do you know that the

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,750
simulations are actually like simulating

00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,220
the brain in a useful way like the

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,840
emergent property that you see for

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,280
example in the case of epilepsy or

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,930
something so how do you how do you know

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,250
that or measure like how do you know

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,250
that the simulations are actually useful

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,900
first we their measurements that we get

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,930
in real life they are not measuring

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,480
single neurons like in epilepsy right so

00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:37,560
we try to much as close as possible

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,660
those simulations to the recordings we

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,790
have from real life but there is an

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,180
example that is useful when I say

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:47,340
sixteen sixteen thousand vertices those

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,870
do not represent neurons that most they

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,350
represent something which is in the

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:55,230
middie metric yay in the order of

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,130
millimeters right but imagine this room

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,930
yes it's full of a and if you want to

00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,120
simulate that that what's happening with

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,530
this volume of air and some properties

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,840
you are going to measure probably

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,000
pressure and temperature you are not

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,980
going to try to simulate every single

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,320
molecule in this room and in the same

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,080
way we don't have to simulate every

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,720
single noon to understand which is

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,990
called macroscopic activity yeah so we

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,490
are we we are averaging we use averaging

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,380
techniques and this comes

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,870
physics which have a ready improvement

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:35,090
to yet let you know and have a great

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,090
representation certain skills question

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,059
hi there my name is Tennessee I'm

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,390
another plot lee fan as well I think

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,580
it's a great choice and my question is

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,230
did you do a lot of comparison to land

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,710
on partly or was that something that

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:57,929
you're directly introduced to I started

00:24:52,710 --> 00:25:00,330
missing lovely month ago now I I

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,220
actually was keeping an eye on pokey as

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,700
well to try to do interactive

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,190
simulations and this year properly

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,980
became open source and available and I

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:15,540
started trying a few bits and pieces on

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:30,800
my family also easy to let I to link

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:33,809
with my no no lots of kissing hi

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,929
question for you my understanding about

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:41,300
the new the neocortex is that it's

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:44,760
hierarchical in structure so with the

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,710
simulation can we see the hierarchy as a

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,950
time series represented as a time series

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:55,950
or how do you how does the simulation

00:25:49,950 --> 00:26:01,350
depict hierarchy okay so far we don't

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:04,910
have a volumetric yes simulations they

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:08,309
the cortical surface is actually a

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:11,730
two-dimensional object embedded in free

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:15,300
in three dimensions but if we want to

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,300
simulate that Cherokee in the neocortex

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,510
so have multiple layers we could add

00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,830
actually volume um there are some moles

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,320
that are trying to actually include

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,600
cortical debt or multiple layers

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,340
interacting with each other and that

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,650
would translate in this case to multiple

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,419
triangular meshes if we want but they

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:49,159
were children is still not yet

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:51,629
for huntin leaned up um this sort of a

00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,070
question on a personal note about ten

00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,379
years ago I was working at the

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,489
University of Sydney in the school of

00:26:55,379 --> 00:27:02,220
physics in complex systems and Peter

00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:07,529
Robinson screw and so I'm just wondering

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:11,909
how the current you know implementation

00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:16,340
and research relates to their approach

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:19,139
to laying up the problem in terms of

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:27,659
differential equations and solving it of

00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:29,970
a familiar with any of that work ok the

00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,980
verge of ending up at the moment that's

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,440
in kernel which is called what what is

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,710
called official witness doesn't handle

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:41,720
what it's called Neil feels right but I

00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:44,970
work on that and I'm actually I use

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,799
these professors models yes that

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,580
implement partial differential equations

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,820
on the cortex so that's perfect a paper

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,470
that will come at the end of the year

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,359
it's the next generation of the next

00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,090
generation is also to incorporate these

00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,220
the skeleton so the white marker on the

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:06,440
pathways in there in the rain to

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,440
integrate these three approaches

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,180
did I am it's probably going to be hard

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,470
tat and exactly but I was just wondering

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,660
if you could give us a bit of a feel for

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,130
the style of but what the type of

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,560
differential equations are they are they

00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:34,360
kind of like flow equations or diffusion

00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:37,780
equations or just just at at the moment

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,680
it's only ordinary differential

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,630
equations yes and they depend we there

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,210
are some moles actually that are near

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,480
know so they are moving the voltage yes

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,730
of like membrane potential some so there

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,490
are also some animals that are non

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,620
linear ordinary differential equations

00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,530
and with addition of noise they become

00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,440
stochastics and the new generation of

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,930
moment models I'm working on but I just

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,320
mentioned is partial differential

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:11,910
equations that involve the wave equation

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,910
actually is not the diffusion equation

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,380
Thank You Paula for the talk my first

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,880
question is what other libraries have

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:40,190
you tried using for imaging

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,100
triangulations it's probably my first

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:47,260
question just so the surface types that

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,390
you're using in Python Python the

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:55,030
pictures you saw on Jupiter is just

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:57,830
massively it has can handle

00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:01,820
three-dimensional three-dimensional axis

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:05,090
on triangle translated objects and then

00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:07,280
in the web interface it's used I think

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:11,660
WebGL they are using and also for the

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:14,030
coloring of the triangle Sam song and

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,440
then my second question have you tried

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,150
any other surface types for your

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,610
problems i don't know how easy it is to

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,080
implement that but have you tried like

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:25,160
point cloud surfaces or anything like

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:28,090
that no triangle surface are quite there

00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:35,690
are so many libraries and so many group

00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:37,520
it's a mathematical okay mathematics for

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,360
handling with fine and triangular meshes

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,850
and triangles are the most beautiful

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:47,020
elements actually to deal with so that's

00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,020
why we haven't

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,130
just thinking about the history of the

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,460
package a lot of scientific applications

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,110
maybe have have roots or history and

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,149
implementation in a in an older language

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,980
like no fortran or see or something of

00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,570
that nature where a lot of the original

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,059
researchers might be familiar with those

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,549
technologies was there a technology

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:17,990
migration of research people as a part

00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:33,200
of this or or not yes we we migrated

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:38,960
this from my love goodbye more questions

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,970
okay well we're going to take a short

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,010
break to get us synced back up with the

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,880
other tracks but first let's thank all

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,880
