Xarray is n-dimensional array package bringing numpy and pandas-style interfaces to labelled data.  Its main use is for manipulating scientific datasets stored in NetCDF file format.

The Dask package brings task graphs for parallel computation of arrays, by breaking them up into smaller chunks, for lazy processing of arrays. It can handle larger-than-memory dataset, scaling from a single machine to a cluster.

When used together, then can be used to analyse all sorts of scientific data.  This talk will look at using them to analyse a timeseries of Earth-observation from Landsat satellites.
