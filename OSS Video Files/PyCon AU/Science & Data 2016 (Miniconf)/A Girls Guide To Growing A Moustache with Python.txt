Title: A Girls Guide To Growing A Moustache with Python
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Science & Data 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Heidi Baxter
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/57/view_talk
The objective is to showcase the power and flexibility of combining preexisting python modules and apply them to the field of facial detection and machine learning.
Correctly positioning a mustache on any given face in a straight forward and fun example of applying the technology in a 30 min presentation

To use an elementary task as a vehicle for explaining and demonstrating the complexities of shape recognition, object classifiers and machine learning.

I will demonstrate the use of image pyramids for image scaling and blending.
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection.
Finding the location of different facial features (e.g. corners of the eyes, eyebrows, and the mouth, the tip of the nose etc.) accurately will be described. 
Facial landmarks are used to align facial images to a mean face shape. How this allows the blending of images will be described and demonstrated.

If you are a girl and want a mustache, you canâ€™t just grow one, so you have to steal one.
I developed this project on raspberry pi and python. I wanted to do something different on that platform. I felt there were too many people who used their Rpi to feed their dog, water their plants or play MP3. I knew the platform had more potential than that. Hopefully this talk will help people think differently about Rpi3.
Attendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training your own object classifier. 
Showcasing the power of python in a fun, lighthearted way. Hopefully, being informative and entertaining.

	00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,899
good afternoon again once more for being

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,330
here in the science and a dominicano

00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,370
next up we have highly dr. heidi has a

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,269
background in industrial chemistry that

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,810
works now as a software developer oh

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:30,269
sorry her talk is tight entitled at the

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:33,090
sky for growing a mustache with and

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,130
today I'm going to talk to you about a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,980
girls guide to growing a mustache and

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,500
you say walk how on earth can a girl

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:46,320
grow a mustache but that is what I'm

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,230
going to talk about I'm not a Python

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,340
programmer I'm an enthusiast it's not my

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:57,480
day job I work as Microsoft programmer

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,160
and my degree was in chemistry but I

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,070
wound up in computer I wrote a book for

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,110
addison wesley immediately before they

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,020
brought out a new version and my book

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:15,180
was at a date I got my 15 minutes of

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,880
fame and then it was gone and some

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,229
people's talks demonstrate help clever

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,140
they are but my talk is about how clever

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:28,560
pythoness i started using python six

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:33,500
months ago don't use it at work only use

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:40,920
it at home and this is where I got to

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:43,759
just using Python and hope and that's

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,280
what I'm saying Python is the star and

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,280
there she is collecting her Oscar I

00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:01,530
wrote a book but it's now so totally out

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:05,369
of date that nobody cares and you say

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,789
well now i'm going to talk about at the

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,920
mustache you have to steal one from a

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:14,140
picture that's what i'm going to talk

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,310
about taking an image

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:23,830
with a mustache in it and transposing it

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:26,980
to another image and so it started I got

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,560
our Osprey pie and I thought what am I

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,620
going to do I don't want to feed my dog

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,330
I don't know wonder water my plants what

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,220
am I going to do I want to do something

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:42,270
better than that so you have a tough

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,520
problem you consult an expert I

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,340
consulted my daughter she looked up from

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,739
her mobile phone and said make it steal

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:57,100
a man's moustache and put it on the face

00:02:50,739 --> 00:03:02,140
with Taylor Swift that's what she said

00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:05,650
to do so you say since sounds easy but

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,830
then I looked at it and the programmer

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,470
in me showed me there were many

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:17,200
different technical interesting

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:20,320
technical problems to solve I'd have to

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,329
work on any face regardless of shape

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:28,720
size position lighting I'd need to train

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,209
it to understand then I start the faces

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,100
were already trained as a lot of

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:37,750
databases already trained but the

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,930
mustache had to train myself so wasn't

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,450
just the case of cutting and pasting

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:48,549
mustache but to do more than that so

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,700
that's why I decided that's what I would

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:56,850
do with my raspberry pi start on the

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,850
journey to give Taylor Swift a mustache

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,590
so I thought what do I have to do I have

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,410
to use image pyramids for blending and

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,290
scaling I have to use the histogram of

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,290
oriented gradients for object detection

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,959
I have to detect the faces I have to

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,870
detect the facial features I have to

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,190
detect the facial landmarks to align the

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:27,020
two images then I have to align the

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,800
images blend the skin tones

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:36,199
and also I'm going to talk about

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,610
training your own object classifier so

00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:45,050
what did I use I started off I used

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:47,300
opencv opencv is a very excellent open

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,020
source computer vision library there's

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,930
many different of functions that it has

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,860
and they're all aimed at real-time

00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:01,000
computer vision the libraries for image

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,000
processing libraries for video analysis

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,300
libraries for facial feature detection

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,900
optic detection people have trained

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:17,449
opencv libraries to find pumpkins and

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:23,389
road signs and number plates on cars all

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:26,330
kinds of things the other main library I

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,520
used with dileep delive I found to be

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:33,500
much better at finding the facial

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:37,880
features an open CV d lib is a soft has

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,729
software components for data structures

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,949
linear algebra machine learning image

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:50,960
processing all kinds of things and so

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:54,529
first step was to detect the face detect

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,580
the face in images in video streams and

00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:03,050
the first step to detecting the face is

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:05,650
using image pyramids and you say what on

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,900
earth is any reach programmatic so

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,050
usually we work with an image constant

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,659
size but sometimes we want different

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,509
resolutions of the same image and him

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:21,710
taking different resolutions of the same

00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:25,099
image we create the image pyramid lots

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,349
of different size images and in those

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:30,080
different size images we search for

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,430
object that we don't know how big it is

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,430
when we start

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:42,360
the different sets of images are called

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,999
image pyramids because if you stack them

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,830
up you get big one at the bottom little

00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:52,020
one at the top looks like pyramid and

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,620
there are two kinds of pyramid this

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,499
Gaussian pyramid and this is a program

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:04,529
which I used to find the Gaussian

00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:08,789
pyramids and that's an example of my

00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:10,740
image permit different sized images all

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:14,250
based on the same image different

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,250
resolutions and if you're looking for a

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,779
face in any of those you can look in all

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:25,500
the different sized images and the other

00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,839
kind of pyramid is the laplacian pyramid

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,539
and that i'm going to talk more about

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:35,610
later so now we've got our image

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,610
pyramids now we're looking at the

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,279
histogram of oriented gradients and you

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:46,219
say what on earth are those if you look

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,219
at this you have the different angles

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:57,779
different tones darker to light

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:59,699
different angles and how they correspond

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,270
to each other so if you have a light toe

00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,389
next to a dark tone how it caused

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,819
corresponds and you calculate the

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:13,529
different correspondence of the

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:16,129
different tones in your image so now

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:19,919
we're detecting a face in the image

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:22,169
there's my two faces and I found this

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,139
man I think he's a Turkish man and he

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,139
had a magnificent mustache and we

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,789
decided he's the guy let's give it a

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,070
look

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:38,200
he's going to donate his mustache to

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:42,990
Taylor Swift so we've got our image

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:46,540
we've got up image pyramids we've got up

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,000
histograms now we're looking for edges

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,230
because another step in finding your

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,390
image is to find your edges you have to

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,700
find the edges and the edges are

00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,520
basically the difference the extreme

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,980
difference in tone and that's what your

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,440
age is off you've got a dark tone next

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:11,260
to a light tone you're finding the edges

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,370
we want to an edge detector which can

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,430
accurately reliably find edges without

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,480
too much noise without finding too many

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:25,480
false edges and there are two different

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,490
types of edge detector that I use

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:34,180
there's the canny edge detector who was

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:39,910
named after Mr Kenny and this this is a

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:44,529
little program which finds the candy

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,079
edges and it's pretty good it's missed a

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,950
few bits but in the tones of the picture

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:53,290
there's not the extreme tones and that's

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,200
where it's missed bits whether there are

00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:01,630
no extreme homes defined but you get the

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,329
idea of the edges the other kind of edge

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:10,450
detector that I used was a Sobel edge

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:13,050
edge detector and this uses first order

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:19,810
derivatives and it has a horizontal and

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:22,180
vertical and that is an example of the

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,370
sober edge detector you can see one of

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,500
them looks very long on one of them

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,450
looks very wide and that's the two

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:34,839
different kinds of so we'll edge

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:36,670
detector and that's an example of all of

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,279
the edge detectors for the two different

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,190
images that I started with so we have

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,760
the canny edge detector and the so

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:51,190
alleged is Hector

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:53,940
as comparison so now we found our edges

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,910
we're going to find some facial features

00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:04,090
so how do we go about this we're going

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:06,190
to detect the facial landmarks and you

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,550
see the facial landmarks you from the

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,250
eyes than those eyebrows the mouth all

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:20,110
around the face and d lib is very good

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:24,580
advice finding this and in finding it

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,860
you can then say all we have to do like

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:33,340
one over the other as my daughter says

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:36,580
bam you're done but it's much harder

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:40,180
than that we come across to align the

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:43,240
edges and you say how hard can it be but

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,880
you try lining the pictures they don't

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,430
even line up one face is bigger than the

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:54,100
other no iniya so you say ok now we have

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,970
to do something more complicated than

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,570
that and then we go to the next step

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:05,290
which is the deloney triangles and if

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:10,870
you've seen movies where the fighting

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:14,440
faces they always put triangles over the

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,890
face and they find the face using the

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,710
triangles and so that's what I'm doing

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:24,280
I've got two sets of triangles and now

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,720
we're going to join one set to the other

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:31,740
and that's how we're going to composite

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,740
the two faces

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,220
and so you say this is just an example

00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:45,169
of how we're going to do the blending

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:51,889
we've got an apple and an orange we're

00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:53,989
using our image pyramids and you come to

00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:57,169
hear you say that's what it looks like

00:12:53,989 --> 00:13:01,839
if you just join them together with no

00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:11,659
blending you blend them together and

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:14,689
that garbage is now back and you say how

00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:16,729
am I going to composite the images are

00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:19,939
going to use something called a

00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:23,449
procrustean alisis and if you've heard

00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:26,959
of your Greek mythology pro crusties was

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:29,899
some guy who lived in the mountains he

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,389
invited people into his in but they had

00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,659
to be able to sleep on his iron bed and

00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:37,939
if he didn't fit he made them feel he

00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:43,909
could he cut their legs off he stretched

00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:46,759
that he made them fit that bed and

00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:49,759
that's what we're using with the images

00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:53,799
the pro crusties analysis morphs the

00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:59,569
images together in the same manner that

00:13:53,799 --> 00:14:02,449
procrastinating people to his bed and so

00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:05,149
in the first image we've just composited

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:08,659
the images over what another we've kind

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:11,929
of lined up the image the landmarks but

00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:14,359
the faces of the wrong size and in the

00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:20,119
second image we've used the pro crusties

00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:23,749
analysis and now they actually match and

00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:26,509
so we've got a pro crusties analysis

00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:29,269
we've got a image pyramids if we got

00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:36,099
everything right up to the point where

00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:41,739
now we have to find a mustache and so

00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:45,529
opencv has a library to do training and

00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:46,700
there are two steps of the training you

00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,810
find

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:55,090
lots of images lots and lots of images

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:59,180
and what you need is lots of negative

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,270
images with no massages or pumpkins or

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,600
whatever it is you're thinking of and

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,100
lots of images with the mustache and so

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,190
you collect them together with your

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,930
negative images your positive images and

00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:17,720
you train your algorithm to say these

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:23,120
ones are moustaches but don't find a

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:30,050
moustache over here so we got thousands

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:35,200
of negative samples then we got positive

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:40,190
samples everywhere I tried to find

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:45,170
variations as many variations as I could

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:53,840
find different sizes different lighting

00:15:45,170 --> 00:16:00,410
a train my mustache and then the last

00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:02,960
thing we did is you say the step we've

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:06,590
got we found the facial landmarks we

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:11,770
rotated we scaled translated adjusted

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:16,580
the Taliban balance landed the features

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:19,930
wrote little program finally Taylor

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,930
Swift has

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:42,000
thank you very much Thank You Heidi we

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,160
have time for questions I see hands

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,420
raising I'm going to go there to her

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:59,670
first question what did your daughter

00:16:45,420 --> 00:17:01,770
say she said yeah it's okay thank you my

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,920
name is Ahmad and I came to the top

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,900
because out of intrigue and curiosity

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,500
the title was very nice now the question

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,439
is the image near the nose and the

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,209
cheeks near the nose itself are there

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:23,250
from the taylor swift or from the man in

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:27,750
this image the nose what what it is I it

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:30,900
the skin has to be blended around and

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:34,860
also because there's a shadow cast by

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:38,730
the mustache the lighting is changed so

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,430
i think the nose my classify isn't isn't

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,860
very good and it really needs more more

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:47,730
training so i think there's a tiny

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,780
little bit of nose has been collected by

00:17:47,730 --> 00:18:00,270
the mustache trainer so yes in order to

00:17:51,780 --> 00:18:03,560
get the triptych yeah yeah it's my my

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:08,330
classifier needs more training and the

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:12,510
algorithms that train the face out and

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:16,650
landmark detector had sixty thousand

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:19,980
pictures and i had about 500 so if i had

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,620
more time train it better you get better

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,820
results but as a first attempt that's

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,380
that's what I come up with you're really

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,360
great session thanks a lot for that I

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,980
was just wondering if flutter bugs had

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,980
contacted you and offered you a job

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:44,260
thank you I'm great great talk

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,560
presentation I can see this application

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,400
in especially in the in the history

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,940
field where you've got like especially

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,960
with architecture or landscaping and the

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:05,970
evolution of it and transposing those

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:09,190
sites using this do we have any other

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,100
question so I have one what meanwhile is

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,230
your code online can we can we can look

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:20,530
at this girl in her early but I can put

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:25,870
it online yes it's so we have one last

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:29,890
question if I don't die firstly thank

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,900
you but you mentioned six months um the

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,640
start of your Python experience yes was

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,520
that just for this project and why did

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:41,530
you choose Python if it was i chose

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:44,320
python because i had a raspberry pi and

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,750
that that's where I started I didn't I

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,220
got a raspberry pi and said what am I

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:53,260
going to do with it and my husband said

00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,150
do some python is pison on raspberry

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,690
parks I've done a lot on the Arduino

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:04,780
down a lot of C code but I decided to do

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:10,600
hi sameen state thank you how do you

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:13,960
very much and again we have in this from

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:17,290
Pike unto you it's a mug it can put a

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,710
mustache on the mug if you want thank

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,710
you very much

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,560
