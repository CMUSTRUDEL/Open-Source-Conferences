Title: Why would a new developer choose Django?
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2016
Description:

https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/36/view_talk
What makes new developers choose Django over Rails or WordPress? As a web developer and community organizer, Josh has learned a lot about the differences between the frameworks and why people make the choices they do.

We'll compare Django with other ecosystems to see where it excels and where it lags. You'll leave with a better sense of the web ecosystem as a whole and why people are choosing things that *aren't* Django. Critically, attendees will leave with specific ideas about how to attract more new developers.

can 2pi convert verse non keynote

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,069
session so first up we have Josh Simmons

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,110
Josh is a community organizer and web

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,400
developer he's currently serves as a

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,349
board member for the open source

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,120
initiative and is a program manager at

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,460
Google's open source programs office

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,619
please welcome Josh and his talk

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,619
why would new developers choose Jango

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,890
excellent thank you all for joining me

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,560
today and thank you for the opportunity

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,510
to speak here it's an honor to have a

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,370
full room especially for a new talk I'm

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,840
trying to kick the tires on now this is

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,170
going to be kind of a different talk

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,190
this isn't going to be all me broadcast

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,809
this is going to be somewhat interactive

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,760
I will be asking questions and taking

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,890
notes to further the research that this

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,680
is based on so a little background

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,780
information when I was working at

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,210
O'Reilly Media I was a community manager

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,000
for web development and open source and

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,460
so in that role I was doing research on

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,890
various web technology communities see

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,559
how they stacked up against each other

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,119
and also just to explore what people's

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,210
favorite frameworks content management

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,590
systems websites to you know just get a

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,500
sense of what the environment was like

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,229
in each of those into the ecosystems

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,939
around major languages like Python PHP

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:24,299
Perl Ruby etc so this talk is based on

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,720
the the things that the responses I got

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,610
from people about why they liked the

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,530
languages they worked in what the things

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,259
were that frustrated them about those

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,060
languages and the tools and so this is a

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,000
subset of that information that I

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,520
learned about Python and Django so my

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,250
hope is to continue this research and

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,040
make it available for communities so

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,470
that they can see how they compare how

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,689
they can improve to be more noob

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,939
friendly basically and how they can grow

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,369
their project over time because of

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,670
course even with a healthy project like

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,369
Django we need to maintain that momentum

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,320
we need new blood and a constant basis

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,560
to bring in new perspectives solve new

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,270
problems so being new friendly and

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,860
making sure that we understand why

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,410
people choose the frameworks and tools

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,520
that they do helps us

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,430
helps us bridge that gap so just a

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,680
little housekeeping Thank You corporate

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,810
overlords I've worn many hats

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,790
I still wear quite a few today I'm

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,390
wearing the Hat of Joshua Simmons

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,340
community organizer and web developer

00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:38,220
nothing I say represents any employer

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,960
past present future with that said I

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,670
should also say that these slides won't

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,440
be available again take your corporate

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,320
overlords but they will all be in the

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,480
video and frankly the slides are pretty

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,910
minimal on content they're really just a

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,460
foil for us to have a conversation for

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,850
me to share some thoughts that I've

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,590
thoughts and findings of course this

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,270
session we're going to try to use the

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,100
full 30 minutes

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,020
again it's not broadcast it's going to

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,330
be a bit of a discussion so there's not

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,760
going to be a discrete Q&A period so

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,030
raise your hand at any time we'll take

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,950
the question or discussion point with

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,090
that said I also welcome to select

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,280
points of discussion points of

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,440
information this isn't a place where I

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,910
only welcome questions right because I'm

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,190
trying to learn from you as much as I'm

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,250
trying to share with you

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,720
lastly I am really not hard to find if

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,730
you want to reach out after the fact I'm

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,709
sure I'll be putting around the hallways

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:39,180
and Twitter IRC etc find me I'm not not

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,430
hard to find okay without further ado

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,040
let's just talk about a little bit about

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,100
where new developers come from right

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,610
everybody has a different path into web

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,610
development and a few that are that I've

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,980
experienced that I've seen come from

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,650
people who get into design for instance

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,570
and when they're freelance designer they

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,950
may have a need to do some coding and

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,170
then they find that that's something

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,120
that they enjoy more than the design

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,970
elements of their work so they may cross

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,739
over and become a web developer of

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,709
course there are students I think that

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,300
is the most obvious path for people

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,030
getting into a development or any any

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,560
industry any field of practice students

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,090
also come from many backgrounds but if

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,000
they're in web development they're often

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,570
in a CS program or some sort of Media

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,260
Studies with a bent

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,540
on technology there are also a lot of

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,980
enthusiasts and business owners who get

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,090
into web development just because

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,150
they're looking to scratch their own

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,000
itch right if you're a small business

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:43,570
owner you may not have the income are

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,460
the the revenue to pay an agency or a

00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,290
web developer to build something and you

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,080
may not be pleased with the options like

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,850
Squarespace Wix whatever you may want to

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,810
build something of your own so a lot of

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:58,720
people who are just computer enthusiasts

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,070
or looking to meet their own needs get

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,370
into web development that way

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,470
and lastly software developers crossing

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,970
to the dark side and I know software

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,100
developers because web development is

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,590
not like software development there are

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,350
a lot of lessons that translate but the

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,590
web is a really funky place and the

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,210
medium dictates and you don't have a lot

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,040
of control over the environment that the

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,810
website operates in at least on the

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,770
front end so there there big differences

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,100
there so this is where I'm going to ask

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:32,830
the first question which is I want to

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,190
know where some of you have come from

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,740
how you got into web development and

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,330
take a hopefully a few people are brave

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,380
and will raise their hand and offer that

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,380
up yes sir

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:54,840
so generalists who wanted to make maps

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,840
and charts and got into d3 people

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:17,470
alright surely they're getting to it

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,720
because it was fun I think that's a

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,230
that's not I think that speaks for for a

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,790
number of folks I know I was always

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,700
surprised at how many people got into

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,840
web development just because they had

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,430
spruced up their MySpace page or

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,780
something and copied and pasted enough

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,400
code and tweaked enough things to

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,260
realize oh like there's something

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,580
there's discrete universe here I can

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,860
control and maybe I could do more with

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:44,050
it if I could get like three other

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:46,530
our volunteers here yes sir similar in

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,330
that started knock of dip I'm more of a

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,219
electronics and software developer but

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,699
I've been sort of dipping into HTML and

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:57,939
then other websites over the years build

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,500
one for myself or small business or then

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,169
still just microservices now to put a

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,349
web front end on devices being built

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,430
right but I think that's a really

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,229
interesting one that we will probably

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,590
see more and more of as we have this

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:14,830
whole and entered Internet of Things

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:17,349
being explode more front ends and you is

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,199
for either consuming the data produced

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:25,750
by devices or just just managing the

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:28,300
devices themselves thank you we have a

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:34,300
full room two more people

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,810
who's it going to be so I got to the end

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,039
of my first year of computer science and

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,719
wanted to actually build things that

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,460
people would use and then realize that

00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:43,810
the web was really the only way to do

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,819
that unless you really want to get into

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,300
like Windows software packaging and so

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:52,750
on so yeah just started making websites

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,839
for friends and so on that's something I

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,860
can I can particularly relate to I spend

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,889
some time doing C++ and Q basic because

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,629
why not but the moment you discover that

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,909
you can do web development and you can

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,629
hit save and refresh and suddenly you've

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:13,659
got like a very immediate feedback loop

00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:15,339
it's a really gratifying process alright

00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,370
one more volunteer where do you come

00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,370
from

00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:25,360
so for my undergrad project I had to

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,819
build a plug a web platform which would

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,699
collect data from raspberry pi and plot

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:36,599
it so yeah from that I started using

00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:36,599
plotly as well as d3 so yeah excellent

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,640
all right thank you all for sharing so I

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,199
think the reason that we asked this

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
question and that we consider this is

00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:50,170
that we come from different backgrounds

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,700
and people have different needs as they

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,680
get into projects

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,650
as you'll note the things that I have

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,200
listed there are things that people are

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,360
going to have wildly varying skill

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,790
levels in terms of Technology right a

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,150
designer may be facile with Photoshop or

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,320
 but they may not necessarily be

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,360
comfortable on a command line they may

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,760
not be used to looking at markup let

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,410
alone logic in code and so what that

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,940
informs what that does for us is that

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,440
informs how we can reach out to these

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,590
people and what kind of documentation

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,110
and tutorials are useful for these folks

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,090
as we as we help them get involved with

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,720
the project maybe not as contributors

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:35,800
but at least as users okay moving on

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,540
let's talk a little bit about how people

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,730
evaluate frameworks and content

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,100
management systems now there's a lot of

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,010
knowledge out there about how folks

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,990
evaluate an open-source project and

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,380
there's research that's gone into this

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,440
there's the software maturity

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,210
something-or-other life cycle it's got a

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,080
long name but this is this is a well

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,060
studied area we're not really addressing

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,650
that here because the reality is most

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,840
folks when they're getting into web

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,790
development aren't familiar with this

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,090
this history of research and frankly

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,390
it's awfully academic it's not terribly

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,040
approachable and so what we have here

00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:19,030
are a number of considerations that

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,620
people will people bear in mind when the

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,780
need arises for them to build a website

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,540
right so one of the things I didn't

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,460
mention in the previous slide oftentimes

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,410
a website web application gets built

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,510
because a marketing agency needs it for

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,770
a client's right and so they hire a

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,450
developer they have an in-house

00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,840
developer and they're forced to make a

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,900
choice right there so they may not have

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,480
the time or wherewithal to do this kind

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,350
of in-depth research so these are the

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,800
kinds of things that they may be

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,510
thinking about popularity that's an easy

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,270
one right how much have you heard about

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,570
it how many resources can you find about

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,100
it online when you search for it

00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,030
documentation how good is the

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,880
documentation this is not just the how

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,450
to contribute or how to use this is also

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,260
the

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,850
the tutorials and the books and videos

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,500
and other resources that are out there

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,490
that will help people learn how to use a

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:22,220
project beyond documentation we have

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,500
out-of-the-box enos technical term out

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,250
of the box is a is something that's

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,870
really important for a lot of use cases

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,450
right one of the reasons that WordPress

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,120
is so popular is that you install it and

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,070
while Python has batteries included in

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,510
terms of a standard library WordPress

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,570
has batteries included in terms of a

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:46,790
framework and CMS and really nothing

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:50,630
nothing compares to that so while it may

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:54,770
be very useful to have a fairly lean or

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,990
Spartan framework it's also very useful

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,459
for other use cases do you have a lot

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,670
that's included or a lot that you can

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,880
turn on the first time you install it

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:07,040
now out of the box eNOS is not just

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,959
about what's what kind of features or

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,029
modules plugins whatever are included

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,459
with the framework itself this is also

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,260
about how easy is it to install and how

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:17,329
common are the environments in which you

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,680
install it I think this is one of the

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:25,490
reasons why WordPress is so so prevalent

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,370
that our Drupal is that PHP lamp shared

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,980
web hosting is practically a commodity

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,209
Thank You Apache and Linux and so we see

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,990
a lot of those out there just because

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:39,680
it's so easy to install those secure the

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:43,010
instability now these are I live

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,279
security first because stability is not

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,200
as easy to measure stability you might

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,089
measure in terms of you might look at

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,250
what the release cycles like you might

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:56,209
look at whether the project values

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,490
whether the project makes breaking

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:01,070
changes you know you look at say angular

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,370
2 angular 2 that's a project with a

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,020
certain philosophy and so they'll make

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,430
breaking changes between versions and

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,050
the upgrade path is non-trivial

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,029
so stability might be measured in that

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,560
way but security is really the thing

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,959
that people are thinking about when

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,500
they're not familiar with assessing

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,500
these things

00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:22,680
because there's nothing so scary as

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:25,009
hacking when you really aren't familiar

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:30,149
with what security is in the first place

00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:33,930
and for instance WordPress is often in

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:35,689
tech news for its vulnerabilities we'll

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,800
get into that a little bit later

00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,110
extensibility in the contribute

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,040
ecosystem this goes without saying but

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:46,319
the more code that's out there that can

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,459
be added on to a project the more

00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:51,269
attractive it is for a user or developer

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,040
right they don't want to have to

00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,230
reinvent the wheel so the more wheels

00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:02,069
that are out there out there for them to

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:05,790
use the better community this is one

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:07,740
that I am working on figuring out how to

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,449
measure I have a few ideas but the

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,839
research is for me at least is really

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:15,509
nascent here but community is critical

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,600
community is about how friendly people

00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:24,180
are how inclusive it is how vibrant the

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,370
event ecosystem is how how the online

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,819
forums are whether that's IRC slack

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,189
Twitter etc so these are the things that

00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,329
folks that come to mind really

00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,629
immediately for folks as they're

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:38,790
assessing projects I want to take a

00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,589
moment here to invite people to suggest

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,589
other things that might be considered

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:55,829
Donna yes this something that I use is

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,240
when the last commit walls because it

00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,009
hasn't been committed on for like a year

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,529
that probably means it's not going to be

00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:04,829
committed on again so I won't look at it

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,629
um it's a really crude metric but it is

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:09,779
one that I do look at the things

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,350
absolutely thank you for that we have a

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,350
couple over here

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:22,930
our meeting checking the arbitrary boxes

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:25,000
on a checklist you've been given a list

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,500
of things you have to meet and you have

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,139
to go and check that they have all those

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,889
things ah right right

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:35,050
Oh springboard off for the first comment

00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:39,699
that not only when was last commit but

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:42,399
who is it by a lot of times when large

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,510
corporations have the Chuck things over

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,579
the wall model of open source

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,470
contribution um if they are the only

00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,660
ones touching the repo it might stop at

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,269
any time it's a very good one thank you

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:58,000
Tim we had one in the back I understand

00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,680
this is a about developers choosing a

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,470
framework but one of the things that we

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,829
come across is convincing clients that

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,209
Django is the way to go as opposed to

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,430
WordPress and all the other frameworks

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,889
right one of the things we've done to

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,829
make it quicker is build a whole load of

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,649
apps that allow you to have those

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:19,800
modules straightaway right excellent

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,800
thank you

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,160
something's not on the list is language

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,839
I might evaluate based on language

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,720
particularly if my operating system

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:39,550
doesn't support a diverse community

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:43,149
absolutely old Python right there's one

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,980
last one something that people will

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,320
probably consider is their past

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,120
experience because if people have had a

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,740
but a bad experience deploying an

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,540
application that will tarnish their view

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,820
if they've had a good experience they

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,260
will reuse it if there are a new

00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,060
developer they may not have the

00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,470
experience to make a complete and fair

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,449
assessment of the software and they

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,550
won't know what they're digging right

00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,549
and if they're an experienced developer

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,309
they may be the product of their part

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,990
they're their loves or other influences

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:12,490
you know we will sit here in this room

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,839
and use Django because we love Python

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,459
but maybe there is something better out

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,750
there that we don't know of because we

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,679
are looking at everything through the

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,309
lens of our own belt

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,929
so excellent thank you I will just take

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:27,100
two more we've got Thursday and done up

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,709
here so one of the things that I look at

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,720
is

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,409
who locally I'm going to be able to talk

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,120
to for help and some meetups for

00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,730
instance are a lot more welcoming to

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,860
newcomers or people who are a little bit

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,770
different from who normally attends than

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,510
others so there are some technologies

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:56,029
I'm reluctant to touch because of the

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:57,799
people involved yeah thank you I'd add

00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:59,570
the the first 30 minutes of the

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,360
experience of using it it's incredibly

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,059
important because like when I'm trying

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,770
out frameworks something I will do the

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,960
usual pip install thing play around with

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,279
it if I can't get something up and

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,679
working in that first 30 minutes that

00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:18,130
I'm much more likely to bounce off right

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:22,039
very good okay developer availability

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:25,220
absolutely the talent pool cetera okay

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,380
so lastly a last couple notes I want to

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,789
mention before I move on is that for new

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,100
developer often perception is reality

00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,590
right someone mentioned that their past

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,630
experiences really color the choices

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,580
that they make in the future given that

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,260
they may not have enough experience to

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:45,799
really make educated decisions here

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,270
there are a lot of things that I didn't

00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,250
list that a lot more specific I think

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,620
Donna for instance you mentioned an

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:55,159
arbitrary checks on a boxes on a check

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:59,570
checklist right so is are you looking

00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,649
for a smooth authoring experience are

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,440
you looking for user roles and

00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:06,679
permissions design templates any number

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,080
of things that may be necessary to build

00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,520
something out the last thing I'll

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,260
mention here is there are other factors

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,059
again that relate more to how you

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,000
evaluate an open source project in

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,159
general that aren't listed here that

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,200
again if you're new you may not have

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,539
experience with this you might look at

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,450
what well what's the license

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,679
what is the leadership like what's the

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,090
government how's the governance

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,830
structured is it part of foundation how

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,010
you know what's the longevity of the

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,419
project how long has it been around and

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,789
Tim mentioned for instance when was the

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,570
last time someone committed to it

00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,330
how many

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,100
the contributions are there how active

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,590
is it over time and how many

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,840
contributors are there period all really

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,310
important factors but I think it really

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,590
boils down to what's listed here and I

00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:57,260
think the two thing the three things I

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,530
heard from you that I think would be

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,290
really salient for someone new

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:06,500
convincing clients right the arbitrary

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:09,920
checkboxes and yes language choice right

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,770
what's available if a if it if there's a

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,120
lot of language X and environment well

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,050
chances are or something that's built in

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:22,820
language X is going to be chosen okay

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:26,120
moving on so this is my very rough

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:30,830
unscientific way of comparing frameworks

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,180
/ content management systems so I'm just

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,180
going to go through a real quick

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,790
popularity obviously WordPress wins that

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,650
contest hands down I don't know there

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,390
are a few open-source few of any

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,640
open-source projects that have the level

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,080
of popularity as WordPress even if Linux

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,520
is more popular WordPress is probably

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,110
better known among people who aren't in

00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:54,050
technology these ratings are scaled this

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,860
is all one to ten based on popularity at

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:59,120
scale based on Google Trends so

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,050
WordPress just takes the cake and

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,970
everything kind of pales in comparison

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:04,550
so that skews the rest of the ratings

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,080
there of course Drupal and Django appear

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,330
to be a little more up in the wings

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:20,600
rails as as a little more notoriety but

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:23,510
not by much question maybe this is my

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,400
lack of experience why are you comparing

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,500
Django and rails to WordPress and Drupal

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,020
because they are different platforms and

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,600
they serve different functions yes thank

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,390
you for asking that so that is the

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,610
massive flaw in this methodology right

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,200
is that not one of these is not like the

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,270
others or two of these is not like the

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,310
others however you want to look at it

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,810
drawing the line between a micro

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,820
framework and a framework in a content

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,530
management system it's blurry but more

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,090
or less there are categories there that

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:54,230
are relevant to how you evaluate these

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:55,440
things I'm evaluating Django because for

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,029
instance wagtail and some

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,210
the other content management systems in

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,549
Python are not as well known maybe not

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,860
as large of projects and if somebody has

00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,960
heard ok I want to build has heard about

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,610
Python and they want to build an app or

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,110
website and Python

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:12,210
Jenko is probably the first thing

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,509
they're going to hear about so that's

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,580
why we're looking at Django here and yes

00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:19,080
to your point that means all of this

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:24,350
data is skewed because these are not

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,789
this is not apples apples so a

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,470
documentation every one of these

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,090
projects really gets this right in

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,690
different ways the the amount of

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,950
tutorials books videos just is an

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,149
incredible amount of resources out there

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,919
and of course the official project

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:41,309
documentation for each of these is also

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,559
quite spectacular so not a whole lot to

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,629
say on that front

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:50,399
out of the box eNOS I talked about this

00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:51,690
a little bit ago WordPress wins hands

00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:53,639
down because that's what it's meant to

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,440
do you install it and you've got a

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,120
smooth authoring experience you've got

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,759
pretty full-featured system on your

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,100
hands immediately Drupal comes with a

00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,919
lot of key modules and installed or at

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,629
least available on install but you have

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,399
to configure the hell out of it to get a

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:09,570
decent experience and certainly if you

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,220
want to have feature parity with

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,940
WordPress there's a lot of contributed

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,899
modules that you have to add Django and

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,039
rails require more here and that leads

00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,799
us back to the point the gentleman in

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,480
the back made that these are really not

00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:28,500
apples and apples to apples apples

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,620
comparison the last thing here in terms

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,960
of out-of-the-box enos is that django

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,059
and rails are not PHP based again lamp

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,649
lamp environments are commodity they're

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,409
ridiculously cheap and they're

00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,149
everywhere and often that is just what

00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,610
people are comfortable with comfortable

00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:46,620
with or are familiar with it is getting

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:50,129
easier to deploy to other environments

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,070
with rails and Python things like Heroku

00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:54,240
make it basically trivial but if you're

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,379
getting you're new to web development

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,440
that may not be something you're

00:23:55,379 --> 00:24:00,629
familiar with

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,889
moving on here security and stability

00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:08,930
this is based on data from CDE details

00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:11,640
right so this rating is

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,790
this rating is again a little bit hand

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,000
wavy but Django from what I can tell

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,890
takes the cake here now again because

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,260
this is not apples to apples you'll note

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:27,180
that the the system with the largest

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,190
surface area in terms of code out of the

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,700
box is the one with the lowest rating in

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,050
terms of security and stability right

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,940
WordPress is a massive codebase right

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,480
out right out the gates it's also very

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,050
popular which makes it a popular target

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,510
but from what I could tell Django

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,880
does really well here in rails as well I

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,340
think one of the challenges for

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,530
WordPress is not just its popularity in

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,200
the surface area that can be attacked

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,300
but it's also the quality control in the

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,180
contributed module echo system right

00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,830
Drupal has a pretty strenuous

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,670
contribution process they have a paid

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,160
security team

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,740
I believe the WordPress also has a paid

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:12,720
security team via automatic but this the

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:15,000
breadth of that ecosystem a four well

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,680
thank you volunteers well they are very

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,790
excellent volunteers and I get emails

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:23,640
from them frequently to patch my sites

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:26,130
so this is a thing where it's not apples

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,350
to apples but again for a person who's

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,570
researching these things perception is

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,860
often reality so if you're going to

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,320
choose something and you're worried

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,970
about security you might not choose

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,910
WordPress just because of how often you

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,960
hear exploits being found for it our

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,850
vulnerability is being found and

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,020
exploited extensibility an ecosystem

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,030
every one of these is built with

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,870
extensibility in mind every one of them

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,900
has a rich ecosystem these ratings are

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:57,390
based on on discoverability

00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,330
of the ecosystem they're not yet based

00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,010
on the size of that ecosystem because I

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,770
don't want to factor in size unless I'm

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:08,510
also factoring in the quality control

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:11,490
because quantity is not always better I

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,870
think and based on what I understand

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,580
WordPress it's a little bit more

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,930
challenged here just its architecture is

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,130
a little older they don't do as many

00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,510
breaking changes but all of these really

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,330
excel there

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,160
now a community evaluating in terms of

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,010
community here be dragons and so I'm not

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,799
going to speculate but there are

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,190
important factors that include events as

00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:37,020
I mentioned online forums that includes

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,580
Stack Overflow right how much does your

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,809
community actually participate on Stack

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,780
Overflow because that's a lot where a

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,820
lot of questions are being asked

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,440
inclusivity how pervasive are codes of

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,360
conduct hello welcome are people from

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,760
different backgrounds whether that's

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,580
their identity or their skill set does

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,100
the community and the leadership value

00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,390
inclusivity and what are the outreach

00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,400
what's the ecosystem of outreach

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,860
programs what is financial aid

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:08,250
availability like in that language or

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:10,380
for that framework so what can django do

00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,600
to improve again this has all been

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,600
pretty hand wavy right I think we

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,490
recognize that and Django stacks up

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,370
really well in a lot of these areas as

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,190
Python in general and so there are two

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:26,760
things really that I found so far that

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,860
might be areas of improvement you put it

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,240
that way

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,929
popularity how does one improve in

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:37,440
popularity you're just not going to

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:41,870
overcome the inertia the momentum rather

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,760
that PHP and lamp hosting has however

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,070
Lane posting is an artifact the

00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,950
availability of it is an artifact of the

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,960
decade from 2000 2010 we're in a new era

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,750
now write as Heroku and things like that

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,970
become more popular as environments that

00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,620
are easy to install python and python

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,750
based tools and frameworks in become

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:04,440
more available I think that might shift

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:07,440
a little bit but I think what can be

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,980
done other than just wait for that those

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,510
large trend lines to to move is do more

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,520
cross-pollination with other communities

00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:18,419
right this is something I speak about in

00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,100
my other talks how much do you as Django

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,840
developers or you as Python developers

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,760
how much are you at general web

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,380
development conferences how much do you

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,490
interact with web designers or marketers

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,440
you might actually be making the

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,600
technology selection right if you're not

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,130
talking to these people then they're not

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,890
going to know you exist as a viable

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,300
alternative

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,590
Python in general seems really great at

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,350
cross pollinating as a general-purpose

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,570
language big and data and science and

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:46,590
education I think this is an area where

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,480
maybe Django could do more and as I wrap

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,040
up here without of the boxiness

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,930
again this is not really in the

00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,240
philosophy of Django the goal is not to

00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,530
be an out-of-the-box content management

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,300
system it's not a content management

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,240
system right

00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,180
but perhaps perhaps it would be useful

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,090
to have distros of Django making that

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,870
distros but versions of it that have a

00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:12,030
lot of the necessary modules or plugins

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,670
to meet feature parity with a Drupal or

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,800
WordPress accessible and well promoted

00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,360
within the community and maybe it's not

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,740
just about having those available but

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,170
it's about promoting those in the right

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,750
way right if I'm a new web developer I

00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,910
might do a fairly frankly fairly clumsy

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,970
but intuitive web search for WordPress

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,500
versus Django right or how many articles

00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,580
are there out there saying why they're

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,950
different and how they can be brought

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,780
together the rest Django is rocking

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,730
thank you all for your feedback I really

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,560
appreciate it as I work on the research

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:52,050
I will be sharing what I what I find um

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:54,360
thank you for having me hey thanks Josh
