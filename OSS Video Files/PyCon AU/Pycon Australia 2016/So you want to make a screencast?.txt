Well, do you?  If so, there are a bunch of tips and tricks that you can learn that will get you up to speed very quickly.  

Creating lesson content is always demanding and time-consuming.  Using screencasts as a medium of instruction is no different, but there are clearly very specific habits that can make you much more efficient.  Specific advice about working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook will also be covered.

Secondly, this talk will also touch on aspects related to working with a publisher. These will include drafting the initial scope of work, negotiating timelines, and managing feedback and criticism.

we have caleb padding caleb is a long

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,030
time pipe in east of some 15 years

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,309
though chemical engineer by training he

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,190
has worked on a wide variety of projects

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,619
including mathematical modeling

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,970
financial and crm software servers for

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:23,160
capturing gps data from IOT devices and

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,779
founded the online code emoji service to

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,869
provide a more effective way of learning

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,750
to become a programmer please welcome

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:38,850
Caleb and his talk so you want to make a

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:42,629
screencast first things first is anyone

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,210
from dev demand here there we go so I

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,070
would not be here and this dev demand

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,960
had provided me with the tickets to

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,910
attend pike on which they did in

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,989
addition to being a platinum sponsor so

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:58,890
can we please give another round of

00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:01,680
applause to dev demand okay so this is a

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,480
mitt of presentation currently three

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,460
levels deep I'd like it to go another

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,500
level and what I mean by that is this is

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,180
a presentation about another

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,580
presentation that i gave which was

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,869
launched by a previous presentation and

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,939
i'll get into how that happened so very

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,860
quickly I didn't injure edit because in

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,680
Amber's talk right before this one it

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,210
was made out that sim varies bad and

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,500
Calvary is good so I had to quickly

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,240
change my history day i've been using

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,880
python for a long time in quite a wide

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,040
variety of domains and my most recent

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,100
big project was producing the screencast

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,509
that this talk is about I also spend

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,420
quite a few months last year building

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,490
that side code emoji calm which I'm not

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,479
going to speak too much about now and

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:52,590
that's my blog address so what we're

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,369
going to cover in this talk this talk is

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,350
pretty much about how I got into the

00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,520
position to produce content for O'Reilly

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,890
who who was a publisher for the

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,210
screencast and I'm going to speak a

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,610
little bit about what that process is

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,500
like because I had no prior experience

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,259
of doing any of that when I when I began

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,569
this which I imagine is the same for any

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,590
many of you and then I'll speak a little

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,060
bit about what what

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,450
you need which turns out to be not that

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,769
much really and some tips and tricks and

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,780
hints about how to deal with tricky

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:25,920
content to show it on the screen to show

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,690
users how they can get things done so

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,430
just to go back to this slide that

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,890
section in bold there is what this talk

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:36,750
is about it is a ridiculously large

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,060
course on on o'reilly about how to learn

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,830
psyphon i think i exceeded what was

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,879
required by at least fifty percent

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,700
possibly more and the history of how a

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,730
gun to this position proceeds as follows

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,620
so i had just come off the tail of

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,280
working for about four years on a

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,379
dynamic model for coal combustion and at

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,670
that stage all that there was really to

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,590
learn from was the Mossad on

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,150
documentation and in my opinion the

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,340
siphon documentation is actually

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,870
extremely good documentation it doesn't

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,190
seem that way it seems pretty crude when

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,560
you look at it but what I found was

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,840
every time I wanted to do something it

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,670
was in the documentation it was almost

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,620
as if by magic every time there was a

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,180
particular situation where I I just

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,950
couldn't get something to work right I

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,600
would find it in the published

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,889
documentation I almost never had to read

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,500
the source code which is which i think

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,389
is pretty amazing however a lot of

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,340
people do struggle from online published

00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:34,639
documentation and so it turned out

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,750
O'Reilly had a need for a screencast so

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,130
this is the point of the story where we

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,599
get to to where the publisher comes into

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,230
the picture and this is really this was

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,720
really interesting to me so coming off

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,750
the tail end of all that work I gave a

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,380
local psyphon talk at the bros pamida

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,000
and it was very well received and two of

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,519
the people in particular Clinton Roy who

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,950
is year and Nick Coughlin who may be

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,139
yeah I don't know they encouraged me to

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,019
submit a tour proposal for pike on

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,419
itself which I didn't think really would

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,639
be a good topic but I did it anyway so

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,700
those of you who were there maybe saw me

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,530
last year give the talk on scythe on so

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,690
after that talk was accepted I got a

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,130
message from O'Reilly to make me an

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,049
offer to do the screencast and the weird

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,239
thing about this was that I had not yet

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,370
actually given the talk the contract was

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,250
finalized before I even gave the talk at

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,770
PyCon

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,950
and then about six months after that the

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,260
course was completed and published so to

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,760
dig into that a little bit further this

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,640
was the first email that I got from a

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,410
riot II a cold email out of the blue and

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,960
I got permission before this email from

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,610
Meg who is no longer at o'reilly but she

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,490
was one of the publishers who were

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,620
focusing on Python at the time you don't

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,950
have to read it all but this is this is

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,410
really fascinating to me so publishers

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,810
go through talk schedules to see who's

00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,760
speaking on what and to see who would be

00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,840
able to complete certain sections in

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,550
their portfolio that they don't have

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,320
coverage of yet that was really

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,820
interesting they hadn't author who had

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,220
produced a book on south on but he was

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,610
contractually prevented from producing

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,669
any video material and so they had this

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,680
hole in this jewel and make noticed my

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,020
talk on the Python a you schedule and

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,700
asked if I if I would do it they're

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,200
based in the u.s. they're not based in

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,310
Australia and I thought that was really

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,660
interesting that these publishers

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:32,000
actually do go through the schedules of

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:33,260
local pythons so next steps you might

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
think that there is a very long and

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,800
lengthy process that happens after this

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,930
about how you lyin all the ducks up to

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,930
get the content made it turns out not to

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,100
be so the first thing that they ask for

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,120
is for you to submit a table of contents

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,040
I was very rigorous about doing this and

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,620
it was extremely detailed and lengthy

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,150
because I was presuming that someone at

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,479
some later point would trim it down and

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,830
cut out all the fat no I'll get two i'll

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,930
get to why that's a problem in a moment

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,220
so and then you have to submit a demo

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,900
video so that they can hear what you

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,960
sound like to see if it's going to be

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,250
appropriate for fullest news and then

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,900
there's a very simple contract that you

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,220
have to sign and there's some US tax

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,440
stuff that you have to do for some

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,350
reason I'm now registered in the US to

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,000
pay tax I'm not a citizen I don't know

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,360
why that is but apparently that's

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,919
required and then you begin forming and

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,220
that's pretty much it there is not a lot

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,140
of ceremony to do this I found out later

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,479
that O'Reilly really does treat you as

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,340
the domain expert they do not have a lot

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,740
of supervision about what the content is

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,349
they rely on you heavily to make sure

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,419
that that is all correct which brings us

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:39,500
back to the table of contents so if you

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,670
produce a type of

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,110
that's 80 odd videos then that becomes

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:48,020
how your contractual obligations are

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,790
defined so you have a royalty scheme of

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,740
25% fifty percent one hundred percent

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,150
and you have to meet those targets and

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,560
those percentages are based on the

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,650
number of videos that you said you would

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,350
do which in my case was was quite an

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,050
extensive list so then you do the work

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,350
and you put in the time and finally

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,760
eventually against against all odds the

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,970
video goes online and you can see your

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,110
name on the o'reilly page and that feels

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:19,720
pretty good when you finally reach that

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:21,620
point so let's go back to our historical

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,360
sequence where we finished with it

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,740
getting published in march so you may

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,419
have noticed in the previous slide that

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,700
the video content is around five and a

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,100
half hours when last have you watched a

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,020
five and a half hour video when last

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,590
have you made five and a half hours of

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,710
edited footage it was an enormous amount

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,120
of work it's it was intended to be an

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,260
introduction to scythe on but by the

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,140
time I finished it was actually pretty

00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,700
comprehensive so it was three months of

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,919
work and that three months was full-time

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,930
unpaid work I didn't have a job at the

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,060
time in order to make sure that I could

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,150
get this get this all done and get on

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,560
with the rest of my life so that's a big

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,810
sacrifice that's that there is a major

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,070
sacrifice and anyone who's published

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,900
will tell you that the money that you

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,460
get from this is just never going to

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,990
cover the time that you put in that's

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:14,120
that that is not the reason to do this

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:19,580
work so big question why do it why do it

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,950
at all it's perhaps a bit trite but I

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,650
just enjoy teaching they realistically

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,320
there was not a great likelihood of me

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,240
saying though I'm wearing the jungle

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,130
girls t-shirt I volunteered a lot of

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,620
places I've even worked at a rails girls

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:38,870
event I'm easy I'll do almost anything

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,700
so why go with the publisher I had

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,770
thought about doing screencasting before

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,270
but never really got into it but when I

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,589
Riley came along and said please do this

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,900
I jumped at the chance and these are the

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,570
reasons why the first big reason is

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,209
credibility many of the people that I

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,119
look up to in the Python community have

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:58,040
published with O'Reilly this is a really

00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,300
awesome book one of the authors is Dave

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,209
Beasley Debbie's Lee is one of my

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,589
favorite Python Easter's if you think

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,720
you know python well you think you're an

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,399
advanced Python programmer when you read

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,139
this book you will suddenly realize that

00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,999
what you thought you knew was just a

00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:14,059
small fraction of what what is available

00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:16,670
to learn so credibility for me was what

00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:20,389
was the big thing to be able to get

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,769
published with such legendary people and

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,540
of course graham dump it in the audience

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,550
as well as another O'Reilly published

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,350
author it meant a lot to me to be able

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,360
to join that community in some way

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,129
expertise and hear the expertise I'm

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,480
referring to is publishing and

00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,339
screencasting and what are best

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,290
practices how to format your content

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,300
what font sizes to use how to prepare

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,670
the videos what pace should be required

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,990
and all those things I didn't want to

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,339
really learn all that all of that stuff

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,050
myself and O'Reilly is in the business

00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,790
of producing that material and getting

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,189
feedback from users so I thought it

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,949
would be a shortcut way for me to learn

00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,749
to learn how to do all that stuff and

00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:59,839
then of course marketing and hosting of

00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:00,949
the video content O'Reilly takes it off

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,929
your hands so I don't need to worry

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:04,929
about any of that if I we're comparing

00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:07,279
this with making my own material and

00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,410
then of course deadlines deadlines

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,910
turned out to be the big one of the big

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,439
deliverables that O'Reilly gives you

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,139
because they force you to meet your

00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:17,269
deadlines they don't force you but they

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,499
tie it into your remuneration so if you

00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:21,199
don't need the deadlines your royalty

00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:24,290
decreases so every time I was

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,299
approaching a deadline I would the day

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,639
started get longer and I put more vidios

00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:30,619
out and then finally before there before

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,499
the US time when the deadline would cut

00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:34,879
off i do five videos that day so the

00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,439
deadlines really do help they really

00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,540
dope to push through the content and if

00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:40,490
I had been doing it myself the demands

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,769
of the real world really would have

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,720
delayed everything so having someone

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,759
push you is is there really it's a

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,049
really valuable thing if you do self

00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,220
produce your own content I would

00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:54,049
strongly encourage you to make someone

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,459
asks someone who could compel you to

00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,929
finish the material someone to whom you

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,309
are accountable that will help you a

00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:01,339
great deal to get stuff actually done

00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:03,999
and then why screencasting as a medium

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,999
medium of instruction

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,730
so there are a couple of things

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,080
different people learn in different ways

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,880
I personally quite like books but many

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,470
other people prefer video as a medium of

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,860
instruction and it's easy to understand

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,470
why because some people like to have an

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,470
auditory channel for the information as

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,720
well and not just visual and the big win

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,400
is if you set up the videos in a way

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,170
where people can follow along by typing

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,610
code themselves so they're watching you

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,050
doing it and they're hearing what you're

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,339
talking about and they're doing it

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,500
themselves and combining all these

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,730
channels should produce a much better

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,730
result in terms of learning the material

00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,660
so when we go to equipment what you may

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,970
have thought of is to produce the

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,430
screencast material you need a very high

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,680
quality studio excellent sound equipment

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,900
huge dashboard of dials and features and

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,600
everything but the reality is that

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,600
that's what I looked like to my family

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,990
for couple of months I'm barefoot in the

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,209
corner of a room with my laptop using

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,760
Google Alert producing exercises and

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:16,430
producing content you really don't need

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,000
much to produce screencast material the

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,200
needs are extremely modest there are two

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,180
pieces of equipment that are very

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,980
important though so the first the first

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,680
thing that you really do have to get is

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,130
a noise cancelling microphone don't use

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:35,180
the microphone in your laptop I I cannot

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:37,490
stress this strongly enough you can't

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,110
get the noise out of the signal once

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,430
it's recorded there's just no way to

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,000
really deal with that you can't clean it

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,089
up so by recording the the content that

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,860
you're talking about as well as you can

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,260
the first time around matt is a huge

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,760
deal re recording material is no fun

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,839
whatsoever it is it is draining

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,140
especially when you have to produce

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,760
Eddie videos and then you need a little

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,770
bit of software to actually do the

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,110
recording and there are a whole bunch of

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,390
options I'm not that familiar with open

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,610
source options but I'm sure if you do a

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,140
searching you'll find some and that's

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,120
the end of the list that is really all

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,190
you need to get started that and some

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,459
domain knowledge and a message to give

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,560
people is all you need to begin

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:20,360
producing content

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,090
another quick note about the microphone

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,190
so this is a photo that the publisher

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,750
asked me to send them to describe my

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,700
microphone setup because they wanted

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,590
very strongly to send me a headset

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,300
microphone and I kept replying very

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,060
strongly that I already had a microphone

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,490
this is a stage microphone which is

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,680
excellent for noise cancellation and I

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,240
use that to produce the course but the

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
problem with a microphone like this is

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,270
that every time you turn your head away

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,930
from the direction of the microphone the

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:50,089
volume changes slightly so my suggestion

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,070
is don't do something like this just

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,920
invest in a good noise cancelling

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,660
headset microphone and then that make

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,130
sure that the microphone stays in the

00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,839
city at the same distance away from your

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,350
mouth at all times regardless of where

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:07,130
you're looking another quick note that

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,589
is extremely valuable if you if you can

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,890
set up a second monitor that you used

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:15,370
for the screencast slides and terminal

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,870
sessions itself that's really good to do

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,900
O'Reilly we're quite strict on videos

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,250
being recorded at 720p and if that isn't

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,130
the native resolution of your monitor

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,830
it's very easy to record a few videos

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,240
for the day log off and then the next

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,740
day you log back in you begin recording

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,000
and then you realize too late that

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,670
you're recording in a different

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,650
resolution so having a second monitor

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,630
setup is is really valuable for that and

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,660
then having a separate user account

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:44,180
where you can bind that resolution for

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,830
the second monitor works really well in

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,820
the second user account you can also

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,650
change the desktop background to be grey

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,000
hide the time hide the Wi-Fi signal and

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,760
all those things so you can have

00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,350
consistent set up every single time I'm

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,300
just going to quickly describe more or

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,310
less how the editing software works it

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,560
seems very complex it's actually not

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,780
very complex and I i got to know

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,270
camtasia quite well camtasia is a really

00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,270
good option for this here you have your

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:18,440
editing features and what i use mostly

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:22,100
out of these out of these options is to

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,839
expand and contract time i use that a

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,400
lot so every time every time you see

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,230
typing on the screen in my course that

00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,180
sped up between 200 and 400 percent

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,890
because no matter how fast you type it

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,390
always looks slow if you watch it after

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,800
the fact

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,230
and that's where you see the preview of

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,570
one of your videos and then at the

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,590
bottom you have the tracking system

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,820
where you can scroll forwards and

00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:45,230
backwards and chop up your videos and

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:49,130
remove dead time and so on and now we

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:53,510
get to content so for a first-time video

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,760
I would not suggest doing scythe on even

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,500
if you know scythe on well to explain

00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,330
everything that goes into how it works

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,130
turns out to be quite difficult because

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,080
it involves many different bits and

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,660
pieces that have to speak together and

00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,060
in the course I also cover how to do

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,690
that on Windows and on Linux and on Mac

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,160
including packaging the combination of

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,690
those things and how to present those

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,450
things aren't screen in a way that is

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,130
accessible turned out to be quite hard

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,320
and these things were difficult in

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,690
particular so coming up with good

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,190
examples I found really challenging once

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,870
you've exhausted like that you know the

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,970
low-hanging fruit it's really hard to

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,590
come up with good examples I knew that

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,950
my audience was largely going to be data

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,570
scientists and engineers but you can't

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,220
really pick a deep science problem

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,340
because you alienate the other ninety

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,990
percent of of the audience to get common

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,400
examples that are accessible to everyone

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,130
but are still interesting I found really

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,140
difficult to do I probably spent at

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,780
least thirty percent of my time trying

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,430
to come up with or find good examples

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,510
and good here also means entertaining I

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,880
think it's really important to entertain

00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:00,020
people because dry content is much

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,450
harder to learn ok and then psyphon

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,130
specific problems scythe on is an

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,199
abstraction that covers a whole bunch of

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,520
other stuff and you can't really teach

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,230
it without not mentioning the other

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,640
stuff it turns out to be quite difficult

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,740
to do so it was difficult to decide what

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,839
to include and what to not include by

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,300
not including things do you set up the

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,449
the person learning for problems later

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,560
so you have to kind of preempt you have

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,660
to think it through and you have to

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,760
preempt situations where you don't cover

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,440
a particular platform specific problem

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,570
but it is likely that they will they

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,910
will crash into that later so then you

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,350
think ok so i should include that just

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,640
in case they hit that problem but i

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,320
can't spend too much time on it and so

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,350
on so this this kind of decision making

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,410
process was was quite difficult ready to

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,890
figure out where to pitch the dial I

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,360
guess

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,440
in what material to include and exclude

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,020
and again there were many tools involved

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,570
and I can give you I think in two more

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,160
slides there's an example of an approach

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:06,170
that that I use to get around there some

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:08,630
surprises so screencasting is absolutely

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,690
not like a conference talk I'm quite

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,610
nervous giving giving this talk and I

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,830
had expected before I began that it

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,930
would be a similar experience and it

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,030
would happen eighty times so it was

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,430
quite daunting it's not like that at all

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,420
but not in any way whatsoever

00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,450
screencasting is a lot closer to the

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,430
experience of writing a book you can

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,440
take do multiple takes so you're unhappy

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,420
with one you can do it again although it

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,190
is frustrating to do it's highly

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,190
editable highly highly editable so you

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,010
can record a section type some code in

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,620
your terminal sit back think 45 minutes

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,780
look out the window type some more stuff

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,220
sit back go and get some coffee come

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,350
back all while the recording is

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,300
happening save it later you get a three

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,040
hour dump and then in your Camtasia tool

00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,990
or similar you've chopped out all the

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,820
dead time you find the mistakes you can

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,050
just rerecord those those bits and put

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,240
it together and it looks like a really

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,560
slick product at the end whereas in a

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,530
conference talk you have to kind of go

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,000
alive and we're in the emitter stage

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,530
again where I'm talking about what it's

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,730
like to give a control while giving a

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,130
comfortable so I found in ish my first

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,870
couple of videos were tough but then

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,190
afterwards I found that it was really

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,510
really easy because you don't have to

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,730
worry about any of those performance

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,350
issues you can say a sentence and you

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,780
can repeat the same sentence and you

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,640
might think I put the emphasis on this

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,840
word but it would make more sense to put

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,250
the emphasis on that word and then you

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,870
repeat the sentence with a different

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,100
emphasis and later when you get to

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,680
editing you can pick which one you want

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,300
it's it's really really nice in that

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,500
respect so if you feel too nervous to

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,040
give conference talks think about

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:44,480
screencasting as a way of teaching other

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,640
people and then scripting yourself so

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,380
the first video that I did my plan was

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,920
that I would have a free-flowing

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,900
conversational style where I would speak

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,120
freely and talk about what is on the

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,820
screen not really have a 22 tightly

00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,900
scripted approach and that was a really

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,730
really bad idea

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,950
that was awful because you stutter and

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,360
um and you are and the command that you

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,650
thought would do something does a

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,150
slightly different thing and you get

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,920
some output about deprecation warnings

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,870
and oh I didn't want that there that

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,370
didn't work at all so what what worked

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,610
for me and it may not work for everyone

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,650
is to script just about literally every

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,490
single action that you do as much as you

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,890
can script before you record the better

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,260
so that means word-for-word scripting

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,150
later once I really got into it I

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,560
started to script my mouse movements and

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,410
even cursor movements forwards and

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,000
backwards and the benefit of doing that

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,740
kind of prep means that while you're

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,960
actually doing the recording you can

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,120
focus on performance issues like the

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,280
sound of your voice and where you place

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,790
emphasis on different parts of the of

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,080
the exercise so preparation really does

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,790
give you a lot of freedom to make sure

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,120
that the content is as good as you can

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,410
make it so I don't want to say that

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,600
everyone needs to do scripts but I

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,520
definitely had to I had to script just

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,180
about every single thing that you see on

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:06,260
the screen and now we get to the tool

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,750
section so we have jupiter notebook

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,700
jupiter notebook hides a lot of what's

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,290
iphone does behind the scenes so it does

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,920
the compilation that does the reloading

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:18,650
of the modules do I show people how to

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,780
use Dupin a notebook so I opted to do

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,340
that I have it I have a small section of

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,130
a couple of videos where I explain how

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,960
the notebook works and how it maps to

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,300
python executing the scripts under the

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,710
hood and I put a little bit of effort in

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,810
to explain what it actually does with

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,850
scythe on and then I think they were

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,730
probably 50 or 60 videos that I did just

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,770
in the notebook whether that was good or

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,660
not is difficult to say I haven't gotten

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,660
that much feedback yet but I am hoping

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,890
for more and then and then there were a

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,060
couple of other tools as well so the

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,330
tools that I used to breeze the content

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:56,450
were slides in keynote a command line

00:21:53,330 --> 00:22:01,760
terminal notebook and then I use Python

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,890
3 with psyphon i realized that i didn't

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,720
ask for audio so this this is a video

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,210
clip that has audio so we might we may

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,530
not actually hear anything will we hear

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,530
something if this play is now

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,650
okay so that didn't play so what you

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,929
would have seen is we begin with slides

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,160
there's a bit of an introduction and

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,980
then the screen changes to a full-screen

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,110
shell with a very large font I think 20

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,090
points something like that and in the

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,010
shell I type Jupiter notebook and then

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,200
the name of a file and I hit enter and

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,030
then from the shell it launches a

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,580
full-screen browser window with the

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:52,700
notebook loaded and I used that recipe

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:57,020
for the bulk of the material okay so

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,270
recording tips we're almost done to

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,669
improve the sound of your voice drink

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,500
enough water drink enough water the day

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,020
before you're going to do the recording

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,020
drinking the same day turns out doesn't

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,490
actually give you enough hydration this

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,900
doesn't sound like a real thing until

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,590
you have to produce really tons of

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,030
videos and you're talking all day long

00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,500
that is probably the most important tip

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,270
of the whole thing is if you want your

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,679
voice to sound clear and clean and not

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,230
begin to crackle at the end of every

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,610
video you really do have to have to stay

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,049
hydrated oops get enough sleep that's

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,789
the other thing so if you're tired you

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,500
sound tired it's actually quite

00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,820
interesting when you when you play the

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,620
videos back you can hear what it sounds

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,120
like but when you were recording you

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,059
didn't hear you didn't hear that that

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,159
you sounded tired I found it quite

00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,140
convenient to do all my recording in the

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,580
morning and then do all the editing in

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,900
the afternoon so I'd record back-to-back

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,370
three or four videos in the in the

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,429
morning and then after you do the

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,990
recording eliminating on-screen

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,760
distractions I did speak about that

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,169
briefly and O'Reilly has a really really

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,270
good tutorial and how to do that and

00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,159
they're quite aggressive about that they

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,870
want you to eliminate just about

00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,909
everything you can from your desktop so

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,409
gray background don't show the time

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,240
don't show the Wi-Fi signal don't show

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:11,330
any of those little icons in the top bar

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,820
and when you when you move the mouse

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,620
around make sure to move slowly so the

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,659
viewer can see where the mouse cursor

00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,100
moves they gave a suggestion about

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,049
putting a piece of blue tack on your

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,620
screen and parking the mouse at that

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,060
location between every movement and

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,740
doing that would allow them to do

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,560
so that the mouse doesn't change

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,540
position when they cut a piece out if

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,830
you use the to monitor option like I

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,690
described earlier you don't have to do

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,310
that just move the mouse into your

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,810
presentation screen when you're using it

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,690
and move it out of the presentation

00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,430
screen when you're not using it and the

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,950
last step is to try to entertain people

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:50,510
because again it's really difficult to

00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:52,430
learn from dry content and that's pretty

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,030
much the end of the end of the

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:58,400
presentation my I guess the the

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,700
high-level points that I want to give to

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,050
you is you can do screencasting everyone

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
can do screencasting and if you're

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,160
nervous about public's public speaking

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,190
screencasting is a really excellent way

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,940
to deliver content to to other people it

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,620
is however tons and tons of work that i

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,700
found the prep time really really

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:22,280
draining and lastly i think having a

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,310
publisher is on the whole better than

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,410
doing it yourself for many reasons not

00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,880
least of which is having those deadlines

00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,420
being forced to make sure that you

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,010
really do finish finish the things and

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,370
lastly i want to give special thanks to

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,110
Hilary meg and Peter O'Reilly who were

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,360
really a pleasure to work with I had a

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,510
lot of fun working with him and that's

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,510
it

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:59,670
we have some time for questions did your

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,710
voice ever give out I find after like

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:05,010
half an hour of recording a podcast my

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:08,390
voice is just ragged and saw an awful so

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:11,400
like if you got any suggestion to that

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,440
you even if you have a deadline coming

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,850
up and you've already recorded five

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,190
videos don't record more so I had that

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:23,370
as well the same thing and if you're

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,600
doing a day after day and you have to

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,850
have rest time if you're doing a day

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,470
after day you can't just keep going so I

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,570
don't have an answer for that you just

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:35,730
you just can't do that much of it in one

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:37,830
go I know personally for myself I

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,650
actually don't like hearing the sound of

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,090
my own recorded voice to the extent that

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,310
I don't like going back and watching

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,080
pycon videos where I've done it when I

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,480
should because I learn from it did you

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,010
have the same issue I will cringe when I

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,040
watch this back and there's no solution

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,600
to that but the thing is you can rely on

00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,850
other people so you can ask people that

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,430
you trust how does the sound do I sound

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,380
okay do I sound good and if you trust

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,880
what they say and they tell you this is

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,400
fine you look great this content is

00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,320
awesome you just avoid what how you feel

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,790
about yourself and you just trust in you

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,860
just go okay I don't feel comfortable

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,060
about this but I'm not going to care

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,150
about that I'm going to trust what you

00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,390
say as a impartial third party that

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:24,900
works for me so my publishers said it a

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,190
funny story so you as the author I'm not

00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,290
supposed to edit your videos you're

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,670
supposed to just record and send them

00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,620
the raw file right I couldn't do that so

00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,210
so I would record and I would edit my

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,830
videos and cut out all the mistakes and

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,740
then send the medina thing and I got

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:48,720
into trouble many times for that I just

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:50,550
I can't I can't send people mistakes you

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,680
mentioned confronting open source

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,260
software screencasting did I Riley give

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,270
any support for commercial license for

00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,940
Camtasia or anything like that yep so

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,509
they bought a commercial license for

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,999
Camtasia

00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:07,999
for me i think i'm supposed to delete

00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:11,039
that now I have a vague memory something

00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:12,869
anyway yeah but so they did support that

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:19,469
and they offered to buy me the headset

00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:22,739
my third and I refused any other

00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:25,199
questions no I have a question so the

00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:26,879
total number of hours for the videos is

00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:30,509
five and a half how much did you

00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:33,149
actually spend how many hours of video

00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:37,139
is there yeah that's a great question um

00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:40,349
I spent roughly three months every day

00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:44,099
so even weekends I would just report it

00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:46,169
to all of that the time the amount of

00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,699
time you're doing record said the

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:50,729
compression time so if you record

00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:53,119
content how much time of recording ends

00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:55,469
up as how much time a final footage

00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,259
between five to one and ten to one I

00:28:55,469 --> 00:29:02,759
would say there were there were two

00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:04,399
videos I'm trying to think of that with

00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,209
packaging videos or if they were

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,209
wrapping I think they were wrapping

00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:11,609
videos so wrapping a c++ library in

00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:14,729
windows and then another example in

00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:21,479
linux i spent more than 20 hours prep on

00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:26,639
each of those and each video was ten

00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:28,649
minutes long yeah what information do

00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,169
you go back from riley about how many

00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:33,569
times videos been viewed and do you feel

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,029
that the number of teams times it is

00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:38,699
being bi viewed by people do you think

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:40,199
you feel it was worth it or you'd like

00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:50,539
put all this effort in and well no one's

00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:50,539
watching it it's a terrible question

00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:57,749
that's a good question so I've got it

00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:01,759
I've got another slide yet okay so just

00:29:57,749 --> 00:30:03,959
quickly there was a book coming out

00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,519
sometime this weekend which did not come

00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:07,139
out this weekend but it will come out in

00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,239
the next few days which I've written

00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,279
called 20 libraries you aren't using but

00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:15,150
should I was going to have the slide

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:24,760
with the URL but it's not really

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:28,060
oops so Torrance downloaded four hundred

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,750
times before I Riley got the analytic

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,980
system set up I I really had no idea it

00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,030
took I think it took two months before I

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,280
could actually see any kinds of figures

00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,720
about sales figure his ol or feedback so

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,890
I checked to see if anyone who's done

00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,510
like an intolerance and in fact they

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:45,310
were in fact many people were so on the

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,070
one hand I thought wow 400 yeah that's

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:52,930
pretty impressive you know it is a

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:54,580
couple of gigabytes but yeah the reviews

00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:58,390
on a Riley are good and the sales

00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:01,080
figures are for me disappointing but it

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:04,300
is a niche topic within a niche topic I

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,790
think the people who who do get it will

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,990
get value out of it because the amount

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,060
of time I took to learn the stuff that's

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,370
in the video is way way more than the

00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,140
cost of watching the video yeah I spent

00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,110
years learning many other tricks there

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,210
in the video but I don't think in terms

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,160
of your viewership numbers or revenue it

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,230
will ever compare to the car to the time

00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,440
of making the material and I think

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,060
that's true of many educational

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,270
endeavors you can't really measure the

00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:35,080
contribution in those terms or or if you

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:38,530
did it would it would never pan out does

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,550
that answer your question can we give

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,550
them another round replies

00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,170
