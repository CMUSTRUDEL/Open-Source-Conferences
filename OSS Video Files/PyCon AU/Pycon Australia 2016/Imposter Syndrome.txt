have Bianca Gibson Bianca Gibson is a

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,379
developer at real estate comdata you in

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,240
Melbourne who became a functional

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,519
programming enthusiast after getting a

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,980
taste building functional web apps in

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,529
Scala she was previously a council

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,810
member of Linux Australia so please

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:28,260
welcome Bianca and her talk imposter

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:32,390
syndrome hi so I'll be talking to you

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:37,070
about impostor syndrome which is when

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,070
sorry my slides should be progressing

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,129
okay beast which was the experience of

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,469
fraudulent thoughts and feelings and an

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,239
inability to attribute and internalized

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,510
your personal achievements sorry in

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,469
other words so when you go I know

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:57,180
everybody's gonna realize I have

00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:00,600
absolutely no idea what I'm doing which

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,430
is extremely common so we're gonna start

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,979
with some questions help determine if we

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,250
have it I'm gonna talk a bit about how

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,119
it works some of the consequences of it

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,110
and some techniques for dealing with it

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,210
so we're gonna start with a bunch of

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,430
questions for the based on quiz that's

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,990
developed by pulling race clamps who

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,610
initially discovered it this is a

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,430
cut-down version so it's not really a

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,320
proper diagnosis I've simplified it a

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,759
bit but if you put your hand up to say

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,869
that most of these are true for you then

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,600
you probably have it so have you often

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,220
succeeded on a test or task even though

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,720
you were afraid you would not do well

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:44,490
before you undertook the task I can give

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,150
the impression that I'm more competent

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:53,120
than I really am

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:59,720
I avoid evaluations if possible and have

00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:01,220
a dread of others evaluating me when

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,440
people praise me for something I've

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,330
accomplished I'm afraid I won't be able

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:12,440
to live up to their expectations of me

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:15,230
in the future sometimes I think I

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,060
obtained my present position or gains my

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,580
present success because I happen to be

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,420
in the right place at the right time

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:26,060
neither I think people something waiting

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,530
putting two hands up I think that's what

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,480
strongly agree I'm afraid people

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:38,600
important to me may find out that I'm

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,220
not as capable as they think I am I tend

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,330
to remember the incidents in which I

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,100
have not done my best

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:49,910
more than those times I have done my

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:55,970
best I rarely do a project or task as

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:58,010
well as I'd like to do it sometimes I

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,500
feel or believe that my success in my

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:06,890
life or in my job has been the result of

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:08,900
some kind of error it's hard for me to

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,080
accept complements or praise about my

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:16,400
intelligence or accomplishments some

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,930
more two hands at times I feel my

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,360
success has been due to some kind of

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:25,070
luck I'm disappointed at times in my

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,269
place and accomplishments and think I

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,269
should have accomplished much more

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,860
sometimes I'm afraid others will

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,580
discover how much knowledge or ability I

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,590
really like I think that might be

00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,290
literature over ace everybody has the

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,450
one person I didn't handle I'm often

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,459
afraid I may fail at a new assignment or

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,950
undertaking even though I generally do

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:54,350
well at what I attempt I succeeded at

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,970
something when I succeeded something and

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,420
received recognition for my

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:03,750
accomplishments I have doubts

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:05,819
keep repeating that success if I receive

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,709
a great deal of praise or recognition

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,180
for something I've accomplished I tend

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:14,760
to discount the importance of what I've

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:16,320
done I often compare my ability to those

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,989
around me and think they may be more

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,940
intelligent than I am I often worry

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,590
about not succeeding with the product or

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,389
examination even there are others around

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:33,419
me have considerable confidence that

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:35,340
I'll do well if I'm going to receive a

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,820
promotion or gain recognition of some

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,919
kind

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,850
I hesitate to tell others until it's an

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,479
accomplished fact

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:47,760
I feel bad and discouraged if I'm not

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:55,050
the best or at least very special in

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:56,910
situations that involve achievement so

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,450
most of us for putting our hands up for

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,160
most things in one of the practice raise

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:07,950
my arm actually got saw I was putting my

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,900
hand up so much but this was initially

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,360
discovered in high achieving women in

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,910
academia and students but it's since

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,440
been found in other populations as well

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,300
it could be hiring women but there's

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,560
actually research going both ways and

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,450
I'm not sure which would be correct and

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,070
it could be higher in some ethnic groups

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,970
it's really the studies that look at

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,060
that have really only looked at

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:34,140
african-americans so it doesn't give you

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,729
much to go off at this stage and tends

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,550
to be more common in minorities in their

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:43,289
field so in technology it could be women

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:46,800
or other minorities and this is the

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,390
wrong sorry I've pulled up the wrong

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,390
version of the sides

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,180
it should be okay

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,580
so it's commenting you when we're going

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,120
into a new endeavor so I thought I'd

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,640
beaten it in a tech context but then I

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,290
went went into some new context I ended

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,970
up volunteering with the greens and I

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,160
went into a coordinator and organizer

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,440
role quite quickly I coordinated the

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,110
third ever Dornoch I attended and I

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:27,690
remember clearly saying I've done some

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,130
door-knocking before right and some of

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,660
the people it's training had done more

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,750
door-knocking in me so that was an

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,460
interesting experience and I didn't add

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,140
a volunteer party one of our amazing

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,150
Melbourne City Council candidates like

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,470
oh you should run for Dairy Council and

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,470
it all came flooding back

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,360
but what are some of the characteristics

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,060
of it so when were experiencing I can

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,780
you read that up the back I'm not sure

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,940
if it will be legible cool so when we

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,820
get a treatment related tasks up in this

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,060
corner we tend to respond by feeling

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,860
anxiety self doubt and worry and to

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,660
creep with this there are two main paths

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,730
so the one I'll tend to take is the

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,000
herbal preparation path where we put in

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,340
so much work and make this trying to

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
fill this task so perfectly and then we

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,020
succeed we get the accomplishment we

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,060
feel a brief sense of relief and get

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,220
positive feedback but then we discount

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,960
the positive feedback because we reason

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,010
that the only reason we went well is

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,020
because we put in more work than

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,570
everybody else and won't accept that

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,430
maybe our abilities had something to do

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:38,100
with it or we could deal with it to

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:41,310
repress nation this is the approach this

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,110
one it's an see this is the uni student

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,580
the stereotypical uni student puts it up

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,410
their assignment up to last day and then

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,090
stays up till 5:00 in the morning so

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,840
they put in a heroic effort at the end

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,460
and then they still succeed they get

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,020
accomplishment they feel a brief sense

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,970
of relief and they get positive feedback

00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,350
on it and then they reason that they

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,030
must have just gotten lucky anything

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,390
other than attributed it for themselves

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,100
so we discount the

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,440
to do feedback so that success gives us

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,620
no satisfaction does not help us feel

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,810
any better which leads to perceived

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,760
fraudulent high self doubt and higher

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,920
risk gives depression and anxiety and

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,720
next time we get an achievement related

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,950
task we just carry right back around and

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:29,720
the success in never helps us feel

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:31,100
better so as we just saw when people

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,470
have impostor syndrome we tend to

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,080
attribute successes to outside factors

00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,210
and failures to internal factors so if

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,710
we succeed we could go we put in a lot

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,830
of work we got lucky

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,930
our colleagues really pulled it through

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,370
and then when we fail we tend to

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,410
attribute it to things about ourselves

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,740
we can't change so we might go if we

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,000
fail that must be because we're stupid

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,500
rather than accepting any external

00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,020
factors could play into that and this

00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:02,060
pattern is more common in women and it

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,580
it could be worse for women because

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,440
viewing ourselves as phony could be

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,500
consistent with a societal view that we

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,840
can be that we tend to be less competent

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,540
and it's easier to go along with that

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,100
than to reject that view and it can be

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,510
worse for African American women and

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,250
probably other groups that suffer from

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:24,250
similar stereotypes and we also have a

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,290
tendency to believe in intelligence is

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,410
fists rather than malleable and that we

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,570
can't really change it through our work

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,360
and when we fail we tend to react quite

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,400
helplessly so we can blame ourselves

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,980
withdraw from the task experience

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,690
feelings of anxiety and shame we also

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,090
tend to be overly concerned with other

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,830
people's opinions on us and try and

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,110
project a really heavily idealized

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,020
perfect self image which is completely

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,240
unrealistic and our self-worth also

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,700
tends to be unusually dependent on

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,740
others we rely on the external

00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,780
validation when it's if that goes away

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,430
we can be quite fragile it's not a good

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:12,640
state to be in I've got a sore throat

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:14,720
I recovered it enough to talk and

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,920
success doesn't fix it because we're

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,020
just going to attribute all our

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,839
successes to something else to lock to

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,190
our colleagues anyone but ourselves and

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,690
then when we don't meet our

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,880
perfectionist standards will tend to

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,310
focus on the gap between our actual

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,320
performance and our unrealistic

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,910
expectations of ourselves and not accept

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,480
the success that we did achieve that's

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,640
not quite perfect and we tend to

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,760
experience a desire to be the best a lot

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,010
of people find that they'll be very high

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,600
achieving in school there'll be the big

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,399
fish in the small pond and then they

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,440
move on to some point of higher

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,760
education like University and there are

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,510
a lot more people there are a lot more

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,630
smart people

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,339
suddenly they're not the best anymore so

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,380
then they conclude oh I'm not the best

00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,450
so I must be stupid because they can t

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,740
set berries of middle grounds between

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,740
the best and stupid

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:10,600
there also tends to be some fear and

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:13,040
guilt about success a mistrust of others

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,490
low enjoyable involvement with other

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,150
people in women low play not doing

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,070
things for fun in everybody low

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:26,510
impulsivity in women and higher in men

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:30,320
lower need for change in women and

00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:32,089
higher in men and low need for order in

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,890
men and there are some childhood

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,640
circumstances that complain to it there

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,720
are two main cases one of them is where

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,810
it's more likely to happen to girls

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,150
where a sibling or a close relative is a

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,100
designated smart one that's going to

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,250
achieve so much but they say the

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,779
designated people person they have the

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,089
good social skills or they're not

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,890
encouraged to pursue achievement but

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:59,839
they still raised in an environment that

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:01,760
values that achievement and then they're

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,370
not really encouraged to achieve so they

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,160
have trouble internalizing their

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,320
accomplishments or on the other hand

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,630
they can be told you are so perfect you

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,360
are so superior success should come

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,910
easily with no work and you have to be

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,070
so successful

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,290
and then when they realize that you do

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,360
actually have to work for success it

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,650
doesn't just magically happen they have

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,630
trouble accepting that because they've

00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,070
been told that it should come easily and

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:32,800
they've been taught to value without

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:35,500
effort and it's also and they can end up

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,310
feeling that nothing they can and

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,730
there's also links to how feedback is

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:45,010
provided to children so if they provided

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,020
excessive positive feedback say every

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,000
single thing they do is so good then

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,620
they learn that the feedback doesn't

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,940
really relate to the actual outcome so

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,530
they just learn to discount it if

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,440
they're told that everything is awesome

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,420
even if it's not but if they're not

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,120
given any positive feedback then they

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,850
can feel that their accomplishments are

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,100
devalued and they don't end up

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,600
considering it worthwhile themselves and

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,890
they can end up feeling that nothing

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,570
they ever do will be good enough and

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,270
it's also tends to be higher when family

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,380
cohesion and expressiveness are low so

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,700
they're not really getting along too

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,030
well talking about their feelings that

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:27,210
much and it tends to end family conflict

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:29,650
and control tend to increase it and

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,470
people with impostor syndrome also tend

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,480
to try to portray a heavily idealized

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:39,820
image to their family members to try and

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,950
win that approval and it's also hiring

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,810
people with neuroticism an achievement

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,450
orientation and there are different

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,010
sources that seem credible that go each

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,990
way about whether higher or lower

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,420
conscientiousness plays into it maybe it

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,660
depends on the circumstance because the

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,460
studies are in different situations and

00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,380
they're also some work circumstances

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,240
that can play into it unfortunately it

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,920
hasn't been studied in a tech context

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,990
that we can try and extrapolate from

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,340
what we can learn from the studies in

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:11,680
academia and library world so from the

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,630
air studies in academia people they've

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,330
concluded that highly competitive and

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,400
stressful occupations can increase it

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,660
I'm not sure if the peer review aspects

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,490
in academia increase it because that's

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,420
also present for developers would be

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,280
relevant to us

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,720
it's quite a bit higher in on tenured

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,630
faculty so people that aren't permanent

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,780
staff so people can be made permanent

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,390
might help them feel better and when

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,040
looked at in a library context its

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,990
hiring systems librarians they're the

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,060
more technical librarians so I have to

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,160
deal this concept technical change

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,290
needing to pick up new skills and they

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,530
can easily feel outdated which I think

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,330
maps quite well to developers being

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,100
expected to just keep picking up all of

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,540
these merging technologies it's really

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,030
easy to focus on the ones you're not

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,970
familiar with but other people are to

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:02,380
get a difference and unfair impression

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:06,740
on how well you're keeping up with it

00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,250
and they're basing as much research into

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,780
racial issues with impostor syndrome as

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:15,800
would be ideal it's really only been

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,170
looked at in african-americans but it's

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,660
bound to be worse for African American

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,550
women the theory being that there's a

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,640
lot of presumed in people presume

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:28,370
they're incompetent more so than other

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,650
women so it's really important for them

00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,240
to internalize their self-worth and to

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,620
be very self-reliant because other

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:46,070
people's assessments of them are going

00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:47,630
to be quite unfair and a technique that

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,850
was particularly effective for them was

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,650
group counseling sessions with other

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,090
African American women so it was people

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,410
that they had something in common with

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,700
it was easier for them talk to each

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,370
other they had more similar experiences

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,290
and they could see the ridiculousness of

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,840
each other's feelings and provide that

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:10,700
perspective to each other and share

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,050
strategies that would work and there are

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,560
theories that this could be more of a

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,330
self presentation strategy than not

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,670
internalizing your achievements it seems

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,560
to be mostly considered to be not

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,290
internalizing achievements but it's a

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,120
theory so we don't want to appear

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,680
imperfect but then we actually openly

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,630
disclose we're imperfect through things

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,630
like rejecting positive feedback

00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:39,779
and it could be to avoid the negative

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,790
interpersonal consequences of failure of

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:44,839
letting people down in the future so it

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:47,670
as a form of expectation management and

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,100
we tend to only express lower

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,929
performance evaluations of ourselves

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,939
when we know other people begin to see

00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,470
it if participants are told that it's

00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:59,129
anonymous they don't actually express

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,579
the lower expectations and I think this

00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,919
would make a lot of sense for women in

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,689
particular environments since being seen

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,640
as competent can make you less likeable

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:12,779
so I think it would make good sense to

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,159
do self presentation technique and there

00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:18,120
are some behaviors that we engage in

00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:19,740
that can keep it going so sometimes we

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,990
can engage in intellectual in

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,480
authenticity so we're not genuine about

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,370
what we say we think so we can tell

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,980
people what they want to hear is try and

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,419
pander to their biases or we could

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,190
implement something how the senior

00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,190
developer or the tech lead would want us

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,860
to not how we actually could be optimal

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,270
and we can we may also choose to stay

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,890
silent in the face of approving

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,270
viewpoints which prevents us from

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,059
finding out what people would actually

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,409
think of our viewpoints so you can keep

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,140
it going and you're not going to get

00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,370
positive feedback on your contributions

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,440
to discussions if you don't make the

00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:00,840
contributions so it's hard to break out

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:03,390
of that we can also try and pick pick a

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,090
target that we want to get accepted by

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:10,919
we want them to praise us intellectually

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:14,520
so we also aim to be light so we find

00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,230
out what would what would please them we

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,570
might pick up some of their some people

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,649
will pick up some of their hobbies

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,169
engages in these intellectual

00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:24,270
inauthenticity lots of flattery and then

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,880
generally gets the prayer is that we're

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,340
after but then we can just dismiss it

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,710
because we just charm them only cos they

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,659
like us so then they can go and pick a

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,480
new target and just keep trying to get

00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,860
this validation but every time

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,220
perceiving it is invalid because of the

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,889
use of charm and sometimes questioning

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,080
why they feel they need this outside

00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,350
approval if they're so Kate mentally so

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,350
capable

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:55,780
we can also avoid displays of confidence

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:58,540
for fear of rejection so this has been

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,030
found more in the studies on women so

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,520
there's a bit of a motivation to avoid

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,380
success due to pre well justified fear

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,650
of rejection or being seen as less

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,360
feminine and denying success allows you

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,830
to act out your achievement orientation

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,710
but not reject that expectation so much

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,640
so that would work as an impression that

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:24,490
would be as an impression management

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:26,620
technique and what are some of the

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,410
consequences of this what is it what

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,910
problem sister really calls us we can

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:37,140
end up with general poor mental health

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,140
bouts of depression and anxiety

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:46,960
emotional exhaustion and burnout general

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:50,920
psychological distress lowers

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,000
self-confidence load job well-being

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,650
satisfaction performance and lower self

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,720
efficacy which is really hard to break

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,240
out of because our current self-efficacy

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,520
provides an anchor for all future

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,990
evaluation so if we start if we have it

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,670
lower and then we're evaluating

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,260
something that we do it's going to tend

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,880
to go down if we have higher

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,610
self-efficacy it's going to tend to go

00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,580
up so once it's established it's really

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:18,880
hard to get out of but there are some

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,150
ways to cope with it mentoring is really

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,950
helpful so they can help normalize the

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,360
feelings through discussing it and

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,420
expressing that they feel it as well

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,950
which they probably do they can provide

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,990
some emotional support and they can

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,940
provide some tactile hold for specific

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,250
problems you could go to them for

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,690
perspective say if you're thinking of

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,850
declining and opportunity because you

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,690
don't feel qualified or not applying for

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,850
something because you don't feel

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,400
qualified they can provide you with some

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,940
perspective and can be more able to

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,490
judgement the new yourself up and they

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,620
can also challenge people to accept

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,300
praise that they've received and they're

00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,419
helpful even if you don't explicitly

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,250
discuss impostor syndrome but on the

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,180
other hand they can be a target of

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,250
unfair

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,940
since comparing yourself to mentor tends

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,440
to not go very well

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,440
positive reinforcement can be really

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,780
helpful a strategy that I really liked

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,220
was from the federal grants campaign I

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,210
worked on you don't need to read the

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,440
notes that's not the point

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:25,900
looks like you're reading them I should

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:28,030
have made it smaller so we at the end of

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,910
the campaign or the core team volunteers

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,730
got had this envelope where people could

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,080
put their notes of appreciation so I

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,670
found that really helpful to help me

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,500
internalized it because a lot of people

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,700
were saying much the same thing so I

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,430
could go oh this person and this person

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,080
in this person oh value that

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,210
contribution I made and they covered

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,190
everything I did from coordinates or

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,930
knots my vital contributions to the

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:57,000
Friday lunchtime quiz and I can also go

00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:59,830
and look back on that when I want to and

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,110
if we identify the feelings that's

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,470
really the first step to dealing with it

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,520
and helping others to identify it I

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,940
remember at one point I had such bad

00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,530
impulse to syndrome that I thought oh

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:16,780
yeah very people have imposter syndrome

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:19,120
but I'm I'm I'm right to feel like also

00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,860
Kendrick I'm right and so I wanted to

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,730
tell me how silly that was for me to

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,980
actually realize what was going on I

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,180
actually felt like someone more

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,020
qualified than me she talked about

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,020
impulses in her

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:40,060
and providing just giving yourself a

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,950
reality check and thinking thinking

00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,600
through and questioning the thoughts

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,220
that you're having and doing the same

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,760
other people challenging those patterns

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,360
and differentiate between what you're

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,770
feeling and the reality reasoning and

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,450
consciously thinking about your

00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,850
achievements rather than accepting I

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,210
don't feel that I've achieve much that's

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,910
just because you're not internalizing it

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,290
some people like to use humor or it's

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,130
just distracting themselves when the

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:10,690
thoughts come up social support can be

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,460
really helpful you can discuss the

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,190
feelings and you can get perspective

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,720
from other people which can help you see

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,070
that what you've what you're

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,880
internalizing doesn't quite match well

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:24,940
with the reality reducing your

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,040
dependency on external validation is

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,840
really important part of the pattern is

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,810
an over reliance on external validation

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,340
and it's generally just generally a good

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,140
idea to have less dependency on it

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,650
because when it goes away you can have

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,180
problems some people like to list and

00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,430
are in their accomplishments so someone

00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,920
I spoke to had this Trello board that

00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,420
she put it on some people might journal

00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,300
it and maybe update your resume

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,100
something to list it and oran it and

00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:57,040
help you accept and internalize it but

00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,340
what can you do just after this talk so

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,430
tough actions I'd suggest are talking

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,970
about it so to other people after this

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,890
session

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,450
maybe at the dinner when you get back to

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,930
work you could get a bunch of people

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:13,120
together to discuss it and that can help

00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,950
people realize Oh everybody else feels

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,080
this way and you can share some coping

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,030
strategies to help each other deal with

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,800
it and if you're all just more aware of

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,580
it awareness is the first step to

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,210
dealing with it be aware when other

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,890
people are showing it and also when

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:35,640
you're showing it so you can fight back

00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:39,190
to those feelings challenge people to

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,640
accept the positive feedback that you're

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,520
giving them so if they're not accepting

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,260
it ask them why maybe they're at

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,990
eating it if they're actually eating to

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,220
external factors like luck maybe they

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:57,080
continue to succeed at much the same

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,520
task very well over and over again and

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,710
every single time they say it's luck

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,540
maybe also if they just keep getting

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,140
lucky or if they're actually good at it

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,840
and try and point when you're providing

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,560
the feedback try and point to something

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,540
a particular characteristic that helps

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,940
them do that so it's harder for us to

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,590
attribute it to luck to the other people

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,590
on the team or something like that

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,040
getting perspective from other people it

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,600
was really important for me to be told

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,220
how silly it was to think everyone else

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,650
having pasta syndrome and I was right

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,140
and it can they can help provide

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,630
perspective on specific things you've

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,890
done and provide more feedback but it's

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,330
important you go to people that will

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,920
judge you fairly for this because if

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,110
it's someone that'll be unfairly harsh

00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:51,680
it's just going to get a whole lot worse

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:54,430
for you and I have raced through that do

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,430
we have questions

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:12,460
yep questions hi I really loved your

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,530
speech that was fantastic um so a lot of

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,390
your Keystone articles were maybe up to

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:19,870
30 years old and that's that's

00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,160
absolutely fine so your resolution of

00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,800
your articles that you were talking

00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,400
about um sorry resolution imposter

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,440
syndrome were only five to ten years old

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,660
so the first question is why do you

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,010
think those that divided and it's taken

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:39,910
that long to start addressing it I'm not

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,470
sure I think we maybe we're not talking

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:44,290
about it as much as we should have and

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:48,040
when I say it discussed in tech it tends

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,230
to not draw on the research at all so I

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,760
think there's a disconnect between

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,470
people that are trying to deal with it

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,970
and the research behind it which I was

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:59,410
aiming to address cool so my second

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,690
question is why do you think the

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,910
research predominantly focuses on

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,120
females

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:09,040
it was initially discovered in women so

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,800
the people who discovered it were

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,600
counseling female students and academics

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,160
and that's where they found it so I

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,280
think that's why it's ended up focusing

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,920
on women and I think it was at first

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,540
assumes to be mainly in women but

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,960
there's now conflicting evidence about

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,820
that

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,750
hi thanks great speech I was just

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,800
wondering um if if you use feelings of

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,080
this and this might be a better question

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,340
for a cycle address but if you use

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,540
feelings of inadequacy as a means of

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,240
motivating yourself towards an

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,170
self-improvement when when you feel like

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,520
when you no longer have that that

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,550
feeling of being an imposter what do you

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,720
replace that with to not sort of just go

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:54,490
yep great

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:57,040
yes some people say that it helps

00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,810
motivate them but I'm not sure I don't

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,370
think there's evidence for it actually

00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:03,160
increasing performance there's evidence

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,720
for the opposite and that doesn't sound

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,570
like a healthy way of motivating

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,010
yourself so maybe you could have

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,400
particular achievements that you're

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:14,570
striving for rather than trying to prove

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,790
that your cable which is generally

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,170
people with impulses injuring they're

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,300
trying to do have particular thing

00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,720
you're trying to achieve and that's

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,100
probably a healthier way to go about it

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,980
hi I'm thanks for the interesting

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,690
presentation I was a lot of other groups

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,610
you talk about I like classic groups

00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,290
that are you know targeted in oppression

00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,340
you know able to talk about women and

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,930
the patriarchy and you know

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,640
african-americans women in particular in

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,970
colonialism all that stuff do you think

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,930
as those structures are dismantled that

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,310
imposter syndrome will come less

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:49,910
prevalent I hope so but it's also found

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:52,040
in other populations so I think it those

00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,560
oppressions can exacerbate it but it

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,650
exists outside of that it's also found

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,200
in non oppressed groups so it wouldn't

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,210
go away but hopefully it would reduce

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,920
particularly safe african-american women

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,480
that a lot of people presuming they're

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,710
incompetent seem to make it far far

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,250
harder for them because they've been

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,080
told by society around them since they

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,750
were very young that they're incompetent

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:20,000
it's harder for them to accept that they

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:22,340
are competent my name is Ahmad and I

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,770
have two questions so do you think it is

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,320
all of the rises from low self-esteem

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,790
and number two are there people who have

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,130
high self-esteem and still suffer with

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:35,150
the imposter syndrome

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:38,780
um it's related to very self esteem but

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:43,160
I don't understand the link that well

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:46,100
I'm not actually a psychologist so it

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,750
can definitely lead to it's definitely

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,210
related to low self-esteem but I don't

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,210
know what causal relationships are there

00:29:52,390 --> 00:30:02,420
any more questions yeah hi thank you for

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,100
the interesting presentation I'm just

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,890
wondering one thing I found myself

00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,050
thinking during this talk was because

00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,050
it's so been commonly prevalent found in

00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,420
women and minority groups as a white

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:18,110
male who is the complete opposite of

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,880
that I found myself thinking I'm not one

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,490
of these groups therefore this must not

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,640
be imposter syndrome is that imposter

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,640
syndrome

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,750
but sounds a bit like me going they have

00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:34,370
impostor syndrome but I'm right it's

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,169
been found in other populations it may

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,779
have been initially found in women but

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,850
it has been found in other populations

00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:46,639
so it's prevalent at least in libraries

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:55,399
in academia or among everybody anyone

00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:57,259
else a related question it does imposter

00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,149
syndrome inhibit learning because some

00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,909
the reason I'm asking this is one of the

00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:04,399
slide she put up quite early is it had

00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:06,080
to do with going outside of your field

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,659
of expertise and going to something new

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,740
and I've experienced that when I went

00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:15,860
from being completely uncoordinated to

00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,179
taking on swing dancing because like all

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,710
of the other stuff that I've done in my

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:23,000
life I was like way way good at except

00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,039
maybe learning languages because there's

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,799
same sort of deal it's like when I go

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,500
into a field where I feel like I'm just

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:33,379
ordinary um I feel I shouldn't be doing

00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:39,110
this I'm just ordinary is does it

00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:40,909
inhibit learning is a question it has

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,600
been shown to inhibit at least job

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:48,289
performance um how much what if you have

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,789
it living probably depends hour

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:50,629
depending on the circumstance like the

00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,399
people that are using the

00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,519
procrastination pattern it probably

00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:00,500
inhibits their learning a fair bit

00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:02,299
probably a bit but I'm not sure okay so

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,710
when you combine the imposter syndrome

00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:05,840
with like they've done in Kruger effect

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:10,070
of being really unable to measure your

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,750
own competence how do you know if so you

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,789
get through in your eye okay so I have

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,730
imposter syndrome maybe I'm good at

00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:18,529
stuff how do you prove it to yourself

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,710
how do you take that step if possible he

00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:24,769
can find objective measures so students

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:27,320
could use their marks that's more

00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:29,720
objective if you're not fortunate enough

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,700
to have something that objective to lean

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,500
on feedback from people that will judge

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,340
you fairly it's very important that you

00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,620
pick people will judge you fairly

00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,350
trying to get people to speak up when

00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,610
they have positive feedback and maybe if

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,850
you could ask some of your colleagues

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:48,150
for perspective on how you're feeling

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,440
about it they I found that they tend to

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,200
have positive things they haven't

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,310
actually said and then if I prompt them

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,750
on it they have all these positive

00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,220
things to say that they never would have

00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,840
brought up otherwise and getting that

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:16,920
external perspective it's really helpful

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:18,630
for me no I'm curious whether or not in

00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,110
researching for this you've come across

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:26,750
any either causal loads Karl correlated

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:29,880
links between this style of education

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,370
for instance going through public school

00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,250
in New Zealand there was this huge

00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:38,670
driver towards either be good at a sport

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:42,540
or you're goody two-shoes so from very

00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:45,110
very early I felt a lot of social

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:50,010
pressure towards proving myself

00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:52,410
externally say how much correlation do

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,840
you think there is it sounds I think

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:59,040
that boxing putting people into those

00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,690
boxes would have a similar effect to

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,340
some of the other the more parental

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:06,060
childhood circumstances we talked about

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,420
where people can be meant to achieve

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,280
things and meant to achieve it easily or

00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,540
can be not meant to achieve academically

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,540
I think it in function in the same way

00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:21,570
do you think oh thanks for the talk and

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,360
everything do you think there is

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:29,100
anything as a community we could do to

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:32,089
help people in this situation talking

00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:35,529
about it it's why I'm here

00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:37,220
and then when when you feel something

00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:39,259
positive when you think something

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,059
positive about say what someone's done

00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:44,089
telling them so they can get that

00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:45,470
feedback and get that perspective to

00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,730
help them internalize their

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,460
accomplishments and try to structure

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,829
your feedback to help them accept that

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,619
it's due to them it's not just doodle

00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:57,410
doodle block and try and challenge them

00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:59,059
to accept that feedback but discussing

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:11,059
it can really help normalizing it and

00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:12,680
he's hugely helpful in answer to the

00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:15,799
last question there are several online

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,589
resources most prominent of which was

00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:21,140
put out by the ADA initiative and it's a

00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:22,670
impostor syndrome workshop and I know

00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,140
there are people here in Australia who

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,019
are qualified to run it I run it

00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:29,029
sometimes in the US if you're interested

00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:30,170
in that you can probably contact someone

00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:31,880
and get them to come to a conference

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,490
like this and do the workshop it's

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:45,319
usually only a couple hours and it's

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:50,119
really valuable anymore nope I guess

00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:52,430
that's it then okay to finish off Bianca

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,420
I'd like to present you a small gift on

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:59,140
behalf of paya corn 2016 everyone one

00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,140
