It doesn't matter whether it is a labour of love, or you are working to pay the bills, or that delicious combination of both, there is a risk that one day you will hit the wall. Burnout is a looming menace in many communities, particularly those with long hours, tight deadlines, rigid dependencies, complex intellectual demands, uncertain rewards and moving goalposts. 

Why does it happen? How can we learn to understand ourselves well enough to spot the signs in ourselves and in other? How can we repair the damage and come back from the brink? Jackson Fairchild will present a lively, enlightening and funny talk based on his experience as both an experienced mental health clinician and a person who works too hard.

okay so we're on so we've heard from a

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,160
number of speakers about the important

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,960
community aspects of Python the

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,910
challenges that that poses to some of

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,950
the people involved in key open-source

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,500
projects and the organizational side of

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,449
things some of the the risks of burnout

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,699
that that carries and some of the lived

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,859
experiences of the people who've been in

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,330
that position and one of the things that

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,830
we thought we should probably do at some

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,029
point is hear from someone who really

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,109
properly knows what they're talking

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,260
about in this area so know no pressure

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,300
at all fine so what we invited Jackson

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,590
Fairchild here to come and speak to us

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,489
all and we thought it was important to

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,260
do so in this this plenary setting so

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:46,280
Jackson's background Jackson Fairchild

educator and a consultant with a nerd

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,870
streak a mile wide apparently and a

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,260
former life in information technology

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,920
hopefully not the result of burnout

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,329
half-half so Jackson works in private

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,180

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,040
essential and significant services that

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,790
good

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,979
my name is Jackson I'm a psychotherapist

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,070
I'm an educator I'm also a person who

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:06,130
works way way way too hard most of the

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,940
time as Tennessee said before I started

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,500
working in mental health I worked in IT

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,870
mostly in the marketing and PR side of

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,890
things but I found that to be incredibly

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,560
hard work I've had burnout twice and I

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,500
mean really serious proper can't get out

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,000
of bed I feel like crap burnout so I'm

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,380
not just here today it elect you from

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,910
the point of view of someone who's read

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,530
some books and done some talks I'm also

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,660
a person who's literally felt that

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,790
feeling in my body and felt really

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,660
rubbish and thought I'm not sure I can

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,069
do this anymore I had the privilege of

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,510
sitting in on Ducky's talk just before

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:42,610
on mental health which I think was

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,819
really fantastic I don't know she's in

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,880
the room at the moment anyway I won't

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:50,350
pick on pick on her but um I'm here

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,000
today to talk to you about burnout about

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,140
what I think burnout is this is just my

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,579
theory is there's a lot of different

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,340
paradigms out there to talk about what

00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,600
burnout is and I'm gonna try and get

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,019
through it in a way that I'm gonna hope

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:05,590
is at least mildly entertaining for you

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,560
so I started my career in mental health

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,150
about 6 or 7 years ago I started in a

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,530
course where they tell you all the time

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,880
you need to look after yourself

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,230
you need to look after yourself you need

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,350
to look after yourself you need to self

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,160
care we need to do this thing called

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,680
reflecting we need to understand

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,140
ourselves and that's kind of all they

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,400
said they then threw me out into the

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,870
mental health world they get you to go

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,070
through all these internships they get

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,079
you to go out into some of the hardest

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,519
areas some of the most depressed areas

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,989
where there's no funding and they just

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,000
need students to work there because

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,190
there's literally no one else who'll go

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,660
out and do that work and then the entire

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,489
time they keep stopping you and saying

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,690
you look stressed like yeah I'm a second

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,310
year student and you've got me working

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,560
in one of the most depressed areas in

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,500
Victoria I'm talking to people who are

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,230
at the absolute worst most difficult and

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,459
ideas of their entire lives I had a

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,140
manager who said to me over and over

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,019
again are you looking after yourself

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,129
are you looking after yourself are you

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,780
looking after yourself and after 12

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,370
months I snapped I turned around to him

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,700
I just finished my contract so I had all

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,470
sorts of

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,870
weird social permissions that come when

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,230
your one foot out the door and I said

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,349
what the hell do you mean by that and he

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,180
sort of looked at me and went oh and

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,410
didn't give me an answer and I said to

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,690
me next time you ask someone that

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,340
question you better have something to

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,960
offer them if they say no and I don't

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,770
know how he literally had nothing to

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,850
offer me it was a pretty dark time I

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,110
felt pretty rubbish I've been working

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,400
four days a week on as an intake worker

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,780
I've been working one day in student

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,020
placement and I've been doing my course

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,600
full-time a little bit stressed as you

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,810
can imagine I was a second year student

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,100
and things were going pretty rough and I

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,080
had a bit of what you would call a

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,910
burnout experience my body started to

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,630
fall apart my relationship started to

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:55,270
fall apart I started to feel like I'd

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,729
made a mistake with my course I felt

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,260
like I couldn't continue and I went to

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,639
school and I spoke to someone who was

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,139
really really fabulous they're the

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,139
welfare counselor it was just this

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,580
really kind down-to-earth no crap kind

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,410
of person who looked at me and said

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,050
you're burnt out this is really common

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,400
almost everyone in this course at this

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,510
point goes through exactly what you're

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,100
going through and I said well if that's

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,100
the case why is it structured this way

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,669
and she said yeah I've been wondering

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:26,260
that too so you know that was both very

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,900
normalizing and kind of weirdly

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,600
structurally frustrating but I got

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,370
through it I then went I left school I

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
have a habit of working in some other

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,340
what you could call the pointy areas of

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,220
Mental Health for three years I worked

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,410
as a grief counselor in palliative care

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,870
and as you can imagine that's pretty

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,940
hard work too I had a similar sort of a

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,860
burnout experience during that and again

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,600
I had a manager who would say to me I'm

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,160
worried about you you need to look after

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,260
yourself I'm worried about you you need

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,000
to look after yourself and the phrase

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,169
I'm worried about you just positions you

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,790
in a kind of crappy way I think so I'm

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,139
here to say today any of you that I'm

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,120
worried about you I'm here to say that I

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,830
think everyone has the ability to work

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,520
really hard and be really stressed and

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,419
still be okay that's actually possible

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,699
you've just got to make sure that you're

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:17,590
fed and what I believe burnout to be is

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,080
what happens when the input that's

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,880
coming in to you is blocked by the

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,620
stresses where the cumulative are acute

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,700
that are coming from the outside world

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,830
and I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,510
about what I mean by that now and this

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,150
is a really strong argument I really

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,680
really strongly believe you need to know

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,450
yourself in order to be able to prevent

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,479
burnout and knowing yourself is actually

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,560
surprisingly hard does anyone in this

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,450
room feel like they know themselves

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,700
perfectly great so glad we've got one

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,960
person in the room is put the end o so

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,229
that person over there they'll provide

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,300
all the advice after this you don't

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,220
really need to hear me anymore so

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,780
there's the important things food water

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,889
oxygen internet all of that basic stuff

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,330
but there's also other things that we

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,860
need in life there's other things that

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,440
the reasons why we go into areas like

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,900
open source programming because you

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,500
don't go into an area where your

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,139
under-recognized perhaps a little bit

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,169
underpaid I don't know you're doing work

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,440
outside of job hours or outside of what

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:20,200
you are being paid for deliberately

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,700
where you might you know you're being

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,410
fed by your passion you're being fed by

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,840
meaning you're being fed by your sense

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,370
of purpose by sense of satisfaction or

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,409
perhaps a sense of perfection perhaps

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,659
it's about being in community perhaps

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,580
because you just love this one thing

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,289
you're working on so much you're just

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,800
really passionate about what it stands

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,409
for

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,059
the problem is is working really hard

00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:43,989
can block your ability to access those

00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:45,279
things sometimes we work for other

00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,080
reasons as well sometimes we'll work

00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,580
that way because we're being told to

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,879
because other people have made a mistake

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,649
because there's just a hole in the

00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,749
project and we have to go way above and

00:07:53,649 --> 00:08:00,309
beyond where we thought we were going to

00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:06,369
go and what happens is the food that's

00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:10,719
coming in and the food that's going out

00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:12,099
falls out of balance so I really believe

00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,199
that you need to keep your resources up

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:17,169
and running when you're working hard so

00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:20,139
there we have my favorite computer game

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,029
of all time Warcraft 3 and it's really

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,800
really important to understand what it

00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,749
is that feeds you what it is that keeps

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,739
you going and what it is that matters to

00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:34,599
you when you're doing this work there's

00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:36,219
an idea that the passion the

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:42,579
satisfaction of the job should be enough

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:44,319
that you should be you should be engaged

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:46,060
enough that you know you need to be

00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:49,540
motivated you need to sort of stay on

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,630
top of of your work you need to maintain

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,130
your own sense of self but I don't think

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,189
we actually get taught how to do that at

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,019
all and what happens is over time either

00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:01,360
you get stressed things get a little bit

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,949
overwhelming things and you start to

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,589
have what I call a cascade failure and

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:07,480
yourself it depends on who you are where

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,759
that starts for some people they start

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,110
losing sleep ducky talked about this

00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,790
earlier about how sleeps really

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,470
important and I believe sleeps one of

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,750
the absolute most important things and

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,279
it's not something that's valorized or

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,730
held up in the programming community

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,220
very well in fact this kind of under my

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,170
partner's a programmer and he like I

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,240
don't know when he sleeps I don't see it

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,689
I think it might happen when I'm at work

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,420
I hope it does otherwise we've got a

00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:36,129
problem but you know there's this idea

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,420
that you know if you're working with

00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,180
someone who's overseas you need to stay

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,339
up all night he works hard he loses his

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,270
sleep and then he starts to feel cranky

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,280
when you start to feel

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,480
here to fix your relationships when

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,560
you're stressed in your relationships

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,990
you might start to make different

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,760
decisions about food when you're

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,200
stressed when you're cranky when you've

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,970
lost sleep you might start to spend

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
money in a weird way you might start

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,330
spending money on stuff that you

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,850
probably shouldn't spend money on stuff

00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,560
on the internet for example and then

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,880
suddenly you don't have enough money to

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,440
be able to pay for the basic things that

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,670
you would otherwise use to maintain

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,200
yourself you end up with a bit of a

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,890
cascade failure is what I like to call

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,960
it as that starts to happen as the

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,180
stress stress to us to go up the body

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,890
has some amazing ways of protecting us

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,440
from cumulative stress or really harsh

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,610
stuff the body has this really great way

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
of going what things are getting too

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,390
much can't do it anymore and so it

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,580
brings down this kind of screen between

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,290
you and the outside world people have

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,390
different words for that I like to call

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,760
it depersonalization which doesn't sound

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,620
particularly compelling or interesting

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,750
but it's when you start to go numb right

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,590
so you start to go now and you start to

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,440
not you know care you start to not give

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:47,170
a frak so to speak things start to get

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,580
like they don't matter anymore you get

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:53,500
up in the morning you go to work you

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:55,030
know like why am i bothering that is one

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,620
of the most important signs in burnout

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,230
both for yourself and for people to

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,130
notice in you or in each other and it's

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,810
one of the most important things that

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,090
managers need to know when they're

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,950
managing their staff I manage a team of

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,360
high-end clinicians who work with some

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,370
of the highest levels of suicide and

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,750
family violence risk in Australia and if

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,590
I see my colleagues walk in like this I

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,580
know we've got a problem

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,140
it's that simple when you start to numb

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,870
out things start to stop mattering

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,450
anymore the things that used to satisfy

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,760
you don't it doesn't matter if you go on

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,020
holiday it doesn't matter if you've got

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,490
a partner who loves you doesn't matter

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,770
if you've got a cute dog doesn't matter

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,830
if you go exercising those things stop

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,540
working it doesn't matter how much gold

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,889
I don't know if you play Warcraft 3 but

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,899
there comes a point

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,929
there comes a point where you have too

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,850
many dudes and so you start getting less

00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:47,499
gold back from your mind and it's you

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,249
know everything starts to go really bad

00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:54,549
from there yeah I take this really

00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,470
seriously but um there comes a point

00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,449
where no matter how hard you self care

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,009
no matter how hard you look after self

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:01,899
no matter how x my manager said to me

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,209
are you looking after yourself the fact

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,919
was giving a 2nd year student

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:08,499
responsibility for one phone line for

00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,809
the entire region perhaps wasn't the

00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:12,999
best decision there are structural

00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,109
issues that create burnout it doesn't

00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,419
matter how hard you look after yourself

00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,649
I could have done anything I could have

00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,859
gone to therapy every day and it

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,119
wouldn't have made a difference the

00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:24,549
other thing that happens as we start to

00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:26,319
make mistakes and the pride in our work

00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:29,079
is one of the most important things that

00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:31,089
keeps us going in our work if you start

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,739
to feel like you're not any good at what

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,850
you do if you start to stuff up if your

00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,439
colleagues are starting to look at you

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,470
over their shoulder and go you're not

00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:39,910
someone I can rely on that has a really

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,459
powerful effect on your sense of

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,589
identity and that can really really

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:47,679
Drive you into the ground if you start

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,910
feeling like you're not as good as you

00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,519
are and I hear there was a talk on

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,929
impostor syndrome impostor syndrome gets

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,339
a lot worse as you start to get burnt

00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:56,829
out because you do start making mistakes

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,629
and those critical inner voices that are

00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:02,290
often there start to get louder and

00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:03,850
louder and louder after a while

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,559
everything falls apart and you have a

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,360
day where you can't get out of bed you

00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,769
can't go to work or you turn around to

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,419
that colleague at work who you know you

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:13,439
don't like too much and you tell them

00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,919
what you actually think about them

00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:17,499
that's not good

00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,110
I had a mistake about a month ago I've

00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:21,819
just come back from holiday thank God

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,739
I just had a two and a half week holiday

00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:25,119
near South Wales which was fantastic and

00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,039
just before that I had a moment about

00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,389
five weeks ago I think when I was

00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,619
talking to my manager and I had a really

00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,929
big rant about something that wasn't

00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:34,289
working at work and she looked at me and

00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:36,399
just went oh you really need a holiday

00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,749
and she came in the next day and said

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,100
I've thought about that talk we had last

00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:41,879
night and I need to say something to you

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,019
you really need a holiday

00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,029
so we booked in the leave and that

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,289
happened I got home last night which is

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,149
why I'm able to do this talk today

00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:51,249
honestly if I hadn't have done that I'm

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,720
not sure I'd be here I probably would

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:56,260
have cancelled my talk on burnout

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,850
because I was burnt out the thing is

00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,920
though if you leave it too long if

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,430
things get too harsh if you take too

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,740
much time it doesn't matter then you

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,270
can't just fix it you can't just take a

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,130
week off you can't just take a day off

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,960
one mental-health day or even five

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,180
mental health days isn't gonna do it

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,310
it's like someone who's stumbling

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,590
through the desert terribly dehydrated

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,320
terribly malnourished and then they

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,850
stumble across an oasis and they take in

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,310
a huge amount of water all they do is

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,600
throw it back up again it doesn't work

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,850
that way when you're really burnt out

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,020
you know sorry it works exactly that way

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,300
when you're burnt out you need to be

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,860
really careful about how you recover it

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,930
needs to take time it needs to be

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,040
systemic you need to take time in your

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,420
relationships and you need to let

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,200
everyone know that you're burnt out and

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,420
you're probably going to be a bit

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:47,470
rubbish for a while and could everyone

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:48,700
be a little bit gentle on you sometimes

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,170
as well there can be a cascade reaction

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,730
where it can just feel like everything's

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,800
on fire you can lose your job you can

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,850
lose money perhaps your partner says I'm

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,260
not sure this is the kind of

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,930
relationship I want because you're kind

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:03,370
of a nightmare to be around this is when

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,870
you're in real crisis point the other

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,250
thing that can really contribute to

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,080
burnout and I was pleased that ducky

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,380
touched on this earlier in her talk is

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,180
about community burnout and about what

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,790
happens when a whole community of people

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,380
start to burnout together being negative

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,760
being snippy I don't know if you've

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,870
heard but people can occasionally be a

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,750
little bit rude on the internet shocking

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,190
I know but it does happen and when

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,690
people get rude on the internet things

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,350
can go out of control pretty darn

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,760
quickly my partner works as a programmer

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,200
I see him working on projects with

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,880
people all over the world and you see

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,260
these emails come through and people go

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
I don't know what that person means by

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,290
that I don't should i be turning on the

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,140
caps lock' I'm not sure probably not is

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,810
the answer and I've also sat on the

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,000
phone literally with hundreds of people

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,820
whose relationships have fallen apart

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,950
because of a text message written

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,440
communication is totally and utterly

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,330
rubbish unfortunately sometimes it's the

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,010
only way we can work I really highly

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,870
recommend any form of Skype

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,950
communication or video conferencing

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,580
where you can actually see each other's

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,440
faces

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,830
the outcomes for that by far and away

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,480
better and also we need to remember that

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,160
when we're dealing with this we can't

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,750
see each other's faces we start to get

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,790
very we start to project our stuff onto

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,990
other people I don't believe that Freud

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,750
got much right but one of the things

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,640
that Freud did get right is that we do

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,380
tend to project our assumptions onto

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,140
blank spaces we have these things called

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,610
schema which are organizing principles

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,779
that help guide our thoughts now they're

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,220
really good ways of making mental

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,510
shortcuts figuring things out quickly

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,520
and understanding what's going on around

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,760
you unfortunately they also make us

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,550
ignore facts distort things and lie to

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,839
ourselves they are really really the

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,880
things that organize us they guide us

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,550
they help us make quick decisions in

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,839
everyday life but they also screw us up

00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,610
it's really important that when we're

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,130
giving critique or giving any sort of

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,810
feedback that we build that on a bedrock

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,910
of hope if you're not telling someone

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,950
you're doing this wrong and the reason

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,449
why I'm telling you this is so that you

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,069
can improve it is so that you can do

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,069
better because I know that this can be

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,010
better then that criticism is not going

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,959
to help it's really really important

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,220
that as communities and I say this has

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,959
someone with an activist past I've

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,309
worked a lot in queer activism where

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,689
people can get very passionate and very

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,490
critical of each other it's really

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:25,660
really important not to call people out

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:28,089
but to call people in to know and to

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,390
have faith in their basic goodness if

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,960
you're not doing that all together

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,800
you're gonna head for some bad times I

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,960
cannot say that enough

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,490
Community Builder burnout is often the

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,490
greatest source of individual burnout

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,970
context switching we talked heard a

00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,350
little bit about that from duckie

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,840
earlier as well but what happens when

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,740
you're doing too many things at once

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,510
absolutely the research would seem to

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,770
indicate that the more you multitask the

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,780
more your brain becomes adapted to

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:58,030
multitasking until eventually you can't

00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,020
concentrate on one thing at all which

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,309
can be really hard if you've got a

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,690
deadline and you need to work for 12

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,610
hours on one thing and your brain is

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,450
literally refusing to concentrate you

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,620
might be someone who otherwise

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,090
identifies as that scope creep sometimes

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,320
the project changes the very thing that

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,270
you found interesting perhaps you're

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,490
working on a on a project that's going

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:19,690
to change you know it could be a library

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,320
it could be a particular collaborative

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,029
project could be a

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,559
conference and suddenly the very nature

00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,149
of that thing changes from out from

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,259
under you it's really important that

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,700
when you work with this sort of thing

00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,990
that you understand what it is you're

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,399
going in for and what you're getting out

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,440
of it if you don't know why you're there

00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,659
then you can't notice if you lose the

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,220
thing that got you there it's really

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:38,009
really important to know what it is

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,630
about the work you're doing that

00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,880
satisfies and feeds you that way if that

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,500
thing is taken away you know it's

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,929
happening and you can choose to withdraw

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,700
yourself for instance if you're working

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,110
in a social justice setting and suddenly

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,399
social justice isn't actually the

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,980
central thing and everyone's getting a

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,320
little bit you know caught up in

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,700
bureaucracy then you can speak up you

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,710
can say please bring it back to the

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,389
topic at hand please let's get on the

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,240
track I saw that there's a code of

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:06,370
conduct up all around the place which is

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,529
fantastic having a shared set of values

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,600
on a project is another really really

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:11,740
good way of keeping yourself on track

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,580
and preventing that kind of

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,879
project-based burnout so when everything

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,929
goes wrong what do you do

00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:21,370
everyone thinks differently one of the

00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,730
things I've noticed is a therapist more

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,500
than anything else is that everyone has

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,610
a unique way of thinking inside their

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,519
own head we all have very similar

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,379
problems but actually the way you think

00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,970
is not the same as the person sitting

00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,919
next to you I've had people come and

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,230
talk to me who literally think in

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,750
pictures in a way that is so vivid and

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,070
so graphic that they can remember things

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,000
from their entire life you tell them

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,470
close your eyes and imagine what

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,519
happened there they've got a play for

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,840
you in front of them they can play out

00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,850
the whole thing for you incredibly

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,350
visually I have other clients I say to

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,009
you close your eyes and imagine a color

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,559
and they say I can't do that like that's

00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:58,809
not that's not something I can do that's

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,580
what do you you know so one of the first

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,320
things I do during my assessments now is

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,299
saying to them how do you think who are

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,009
you how do you think when you when

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,899
you're processing something in your head

00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:10,269
how does that occur do you play it out

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:12,340
between different voices do you think in

00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:13,779
terms of feelings do you have a good

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,269
memory of emotions do you remember what

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,100
emotions feel like if I say to someone

00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,840
imagine being angry some people

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,250
literally have no memory of the last

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,559
time they were angry they can remember

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,970
what they did they can remember how they

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,230
sounded they can remember what happened

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,610
but they cannot remember how they felt

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,899
all of these things are really important

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,670
when we're talking about self-care

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,350
because if I tell you you need to

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,300
slow down and have a rest and you're a

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,620
person who's worked every day of your

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,870
life you never have time off your busy

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,480
you fill your whole life up and I say go

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,730
and sit in the corner and be silent and

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,380
it's not going to work out for you

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,480
people often go quite crazy actually in

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,980
that context it's one of the reasons why

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,600
people who are admitted to hospital for

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,940
mental health disorders sometimes have

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,860
poor outcomes is because the change in

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,830
their routine is just too jarring for

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,620
them to cope routine is very very very

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,850
important holidays you can tell someone

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,680
go on a holiday you need to go on a

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,260
holiday people sang to this to me all

00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,720
the time I was a student I got paid

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,850
minimum wage to do a very hard job I had

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,830
a lot of debts from when I had even less

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,420
work I was paying off my credit card I

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,270
couldn't afford to go on a holiday I

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,200
didn't have time I had assignments it's

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,700
really important to check your

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,890
privileges when you're working on this

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,840
stuff - or when you're supporting

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,660
somebody else to actually get the kind

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,270
of support they need I really believe

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,710
that inside I saw we have a self riding

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,760
impulse something that will reach out

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,560
for the things that we need

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,740
instinctively but we need to get the

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,030
barriers out of the way one of one of

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,240
the things that's really important to

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,770
notice is stigma we all get socialized

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,540
in different ways to believe different

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,620
things about ourselves it's really

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,110
important to give ourselves that

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:54,430
permission to understand ourselves and

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,430
to give ourselves permission to be who

00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:02,710
we want to be now maybe we're not all

00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:04,270
Obama but I think it's also important

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,740
not to know ourselves at our worst but

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,480
also to get to know you when you're at

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,590
your best one of the best things I can

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,730
recommend to you is when you're going

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,900
through a really good period of your

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,980
life and everything's going really

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:17,610
amazing go to a therapist then not only

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,610
is it good for us

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:26,130
a little bit of a selfish moment but you

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,810
can then get an inventory a check-in and

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,700
a reflective process to help get a

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,280
metric about what looks like life looks

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,760
like when you're well when you're doing

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,140
great

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,790
because I don't know about you but when

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,910
I'm feeling really rubbish I can't even

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,980
remember what good feels like it's so

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,420
cut off it's so far away my emotional

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,160
memory is not very good I can't remember

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,760
positive feelings when I'm depressed

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,860
so going to a therapist at that point is

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,360
a really valuable thing to do if you're

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,250
into therapy this is the other really

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,690
important thing I can go around saying

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,340
you need to see a therapist because hey

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,770
it's an important industry because I

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,780
want to get paid but it's also really

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,310
important to say to you that therapy is

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,900
not for everyone a lot of people talking

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,060
about your problems it actually makes

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,040
you feel worse for a lot of people

00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,200
talking you may have been socialized a

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,480
certain way or maybe you just don't like

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,120
the sound of your own voice or maybe the

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,730
way you process your stuff is through us

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,430
through exercise through martial arts

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,590
through friendship communities or just

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,940
achieving something in the world it's

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,500
really important to understand those

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,350
bits about yourself and to understand

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,760
who you are the other thing that's

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,430
really important and this is my final

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,300
thing that I want to say to you today is

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,080
to understand the hard stuff and the

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,900
garbage that we build up inside

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,430
ourselves sometimes bad stuff happens in

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,950
life the big things deaths illness we're

00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:53,220
all going to get old one day and let's

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:55,830
Google fixes that and sometimes

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,270
tragedies occur sometimes for most of us

00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,400
we already have some tragedies in our

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,380
past already I like to think in a very

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,290
mechanical way I like to think about

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,120
myself as a landscape as a map has a

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,070
garden and I like to think about if I'm

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,300
planting a garden and I've got

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,650
everything working I've got the right

00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,790
amount of sunlight over there I've got

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,710
the right amount of water over there

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,540
everything's being fed well I also need

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,190
to figure out where I'm gonna put the

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,910
waste products I need to figure out how

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,050
to process stuff you don't just pour

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,790
effluent onto a garden you throw

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,850
processed fertilizer onto the garden

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,590
and process fertilizer is really really

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,610
good for growth and it's a really tacky

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,460
metaphor but I really like it

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,400
I just really believe that we need to

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,049
take our psychological waste and we need

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,910
to process it we need to reflect on it

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,260
we need to learn and then we can grow

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,809
and there's nothing better than growing

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,820
through a Burnout experience if you go

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,230
through a burnout experience if you make

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,580
it through to the other side and you can

00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,260
get back to your work and get back to

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,870
what you love you will be ten times

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,130
stronger than where you were before

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,690
provided you make it through provided

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,690
you don't get irreversibly scarred

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,630
when you're choosing a therapist as well

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,040
I encourage you to go in if you do

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,090
decide to go and see someone to have a

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,410
talk to someone doesn't have to be a

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,570
therapist it could be a coach

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,490
it could just be a mentor go and see

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,350
someone who has the qualities you're

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,820
looking for figuring out who it is you

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,560
want do you want someone who challenges

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,990
you do you want someone who sits there

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,870
and softly listens and hold space or do

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,610
you want someone who educates you I'm a

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,350
fairly challenging sort of therapist and

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,580
I like to educate my clients and make

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,550
them as much of an expert on what's

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,050
going on for them as I am or at least as

00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,430
I think I am because actually they know

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,290
a lot more about themselves than I do

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,210
and if they don't leave they're paying

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,650
me however many dollars an hour they

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,760
should walk out of there not just

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,810
feeling like they've been heard they

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,040
should go out there feeling like they've

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,900
been heard and like they've leveled up

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,070
like they can spend those experience

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,400
points on something that's actually

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,950
worth having them for so I really

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,140
encourage you no matter what you do as

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,270
you go through figure out who you are

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,380
figure out what feeds you figure out why

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,200
you're doing the work that you're doing

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,130
write that stuff down tell your friends

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,590
get it in your head

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,030
understand what it is whether it's the

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,830
meaning the achievement the sense of

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,560
perfection whether you just like to

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:18,170
nerding out about Python I don't know

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,820
figure out what that is protect it and

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:24,240
when and notice when that stuff gets cut

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:27,200
off it's so important we only get one

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,110
life and this stuff can ruin your career

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,780
burnout is a really serious matter the

00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,130
rates of mental health outcomes in any

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,770
sort of community where people are

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,680
working for love not money are really

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:43,710
really high but so are the rates of

00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,930
transformation of achievement and of

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,040
changing the world and I really believe

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,480
having already spoken to a number of

00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,700
people here today this is an amazing

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,120
community and I really look forward to

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,510
seeing where you guys take yourselves

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,510
