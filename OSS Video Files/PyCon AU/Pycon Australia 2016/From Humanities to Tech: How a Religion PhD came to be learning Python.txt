Despite studying Physics, Chemistry, and the compulsory Maths at High School, I ended up in a Arts degree at University, and from there majored in Studies in Religion and History and continued on to do postgraduate research degrees in Religion. But along the way I became employed in IT and since completing my PhD have been teaching myself Python (among other things). However all these years in the Humanities have resulted in a particular way of approaching learning, one that is not entirely helpful to learning programming. In addition to this, there is also how I can make my new skills relevant to all those years of research and study?

This talk is going to be about my own journey from a STEM high school student, to a humanities researcher, and then to IT, and what I have learnt along the way. It is also about why (I think) teaching children about computers and programming is incredibly important. And also, what I am doing, and planning to do with my new found Python skills in relation to my PhD and potential further research.

Hey so it's Sunday morning and I'm a

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,990
religion PhD don't worry you haven't

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,519
mistakenly suddenly turned up at mass so

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,679
today I'm gonna talk about being

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,890
humanities research are who is now in

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
tech how I got here things I've learned

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,949
along the way and why I think it's

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,970
important people are exposed to the

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,710
possibility of learning to code so I was

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,869
born in the 80s and I grew up playing

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,750
with Meccano and Lego and doing those

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,300
classic building style games in high

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,969
school my maths faltered so I need only

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,850
ended up doing two unit but I did

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,160
physics in chemistry for the HSC and I

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,480
plan on going into engineering but with

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,809
only doing two unit maths

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,710
I'd need a 90 plus there and that just

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,420
wasn't gonna happen so I wasn't really

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,960
interested in doing a Bachelor of

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,789
Science because I wasn't really that

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,460
enthused about continuing on with just

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,559
straight physics or chemistry and no one

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,519
had really mentioned or encouraged me to

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,189
look at computers so and I didn't have

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
one at home until I was in year 10 or 11

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,210
and by that stage I'd moved out of like

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,790
really pulling things apart and putting

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,590
them back together so I decided to go on

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,900
to a Bachelor of Arts where I could

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,590
study the areas of humanities that I

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,890
hadn't really been able to look at in

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,610
high school so my BA was pretty

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,130
straightforward

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,579
I studied some medieval history various

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,799
religions and I went on and did a did my

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,320
honours about a modern pagan religion

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,829
and then in my Master's I began my love

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,350
for religion and popular culture and I

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,409
wrote about the computer game HMF ology

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,610
which is a sides game to Age of Empires

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,140
series so during my Master's that I also

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,240
became a bit more tech aware and

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,100
involved with computers had the

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,469
prompting of my partner I built my own

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,229
computer which was terrifying when you

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,939
push the RAM in and it's really it's

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,689
like it's not going in you think you're

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,930
gonna break it

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,599
and with my subject area involving new

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,950
media I was engaging within your areas

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,989
your fields of research

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,540
I had a year off between my masters and

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:19,849
my PhD and during that time I started

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,500
working in an IT role and in it we

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,300
access parts of their identity imagine

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,620
management system through a command line

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,860
and being shown this my mind Warren it's

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,750
just like magic type things in and then

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,330
more stuff comes up on the screen and

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,660
you talk more and it was just like

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,519
amazing it was so magical so it's

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,030
prompted me to install a bunch or my new

00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,299
laptop

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,610
however is doing humanities PhD I didn't

00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:49,430
really get too much with it and given

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,810
bun to and my race of my referencing

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,200
software didn't really play well

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,299
together and my laptop was extremely

00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,920
heavy I ended up just starting to use

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:04,250
the computers at uni so I continued to

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,930
work in IT casually during my PhD but

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,090
these four years were dedicated to my

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,890
research which was again looking at

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,660
religion and popular culture this time

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,790
looking at three case studies Percy

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,280
Jackson and the Olympians which is a

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,470
young adult novel series a commie a

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,720
Japanese console game and World of

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,450
Warcraft which I assume you've all heard

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,880
of and if you're wondering what exactly

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,660
are you doing in my thesis it was

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,880
essentially this oh look there's a thing

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,799
in the game or novel that's taken from

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,069
real world religions and cultures now

00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,859
let's analyze it and for those curious

00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:44,150
that's a statue of a shark from one

00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:46,609
Warcraft and it's compared with the

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:49,010
Hindu deity Shiva doing a dance that

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,450
will destroy the universe and the second

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,160
is a pillar that you'll find in most

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,190
trial settlements in World of Warcraft

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,829
and it's compared with serpent pillars

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:03,349
from the temple of warriors at chichen

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:05,269
itza okay so has anyone he'd done

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:10,010
humanity is either an undergrad or post

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:14,269
grad okay so a few of you but for the

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,950
others it's like my PhD was very

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,530
hermeneutics based or text based

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,539
research which is what you'll find in a

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,580
lot of humanities but some sections will

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,440
do things a bit differently but in

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,300
essence the process of doing humanities

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,909
PhD is repetitive

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,250
you do lots of research and reading that

00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:32,319
is going through books and articles

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,729
finding those sources to begin with

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,069
writing it all up and then giving it

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,229
over to your supervisor to read over who

00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,030
will then give you feedback and point

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,580
out more stuff you've got a read and

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,440
that's repeat the process as I was

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,120
looking at computer games I also hinted

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,389
great I had to integrate that research

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,270
into this routine as well if we go back

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,530
to the previous slide so I would look at

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,389
various things in the popular culture

00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,039
case studies and then I have to scour

00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,300
sources to find the confirm comparisons

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,129
sometimes it was easy things were

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,039
familiar I was familiar with already

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,349
so like Hindu iconography but in cases

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,479
Mesoamerican architecture I'd spend

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:14,000
hours looking at images just trying to

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,560
find a crossover it's like oh yay people

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,569
have put holiday snaps up on the

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,569
internet from going to Chichen itzÃ¡ oh

00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,379
that's something useful can I find

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,900
something a bit more concrete and I'm

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:31,130
not just you know referencing hey

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,319
someone went there on holiday and a lot

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,639
of the time doing this information so a

00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,409
lot of the time is spent doing this

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,949
information gathering and processing and

00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:41,719
analyzing that information and even this

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,490
it's very human unique style of research

00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:45,979
so different to those who do fieldwork

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,259
but this is how you learn and produce in

00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:52,580
a humanities framework lots of prep work

00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:56,810
then they're doing then the feedback

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,629
from an outside source so towards the

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,659
end of my thesis is over it and if you

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,879
talk to other people who've done a PhD

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:07,639
they feel the same way just at the end

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,759
just just be over I want to move on with

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,330
my life just please do gods be make my

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,430
thesis just be done and it was at this

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,860
point I wanted something new in my life

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,840
and I decided I wanted to explore more

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,810
of that stuff that had really excited me

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,279
when I started my IT job so I figured

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,680
I'd learning some programming after my

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:33,560
thesis was done and my partner suggested

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,419
Python so since October 2013 I've been

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,130
learning Python I started with a

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,570
Coursera course and that went really

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,800
well

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,949
but continuing on from there

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,490
I've run into a few problems firstly I

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,319
have to go back to being a beginner

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,870
after becoming effectively an expert in

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,289
a subject area I'm now back to basics

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,150
and it's this massive disconnect stuff

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,039
I've just been learning I'm teaching to

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,620
teenagers at the girls programming

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,569
network and there are girls in primary

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,729
school that are just so advanced and

00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:09,530
reconciling that with my own stage of

00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:11,690
learning can be confronting and there

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,169
are also lots of resources out there for

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,569
learning the basics so I have the basics

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,099
down variables.less creating simple

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:25,280
functions but where to from here and

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:27,710
what next where's my 201 stuff and

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,370
there's also the whole way of finding

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,840
information and getting help on topics

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,759
well how I would find information for my

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,590
thesis topic is different to how I need

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,199
to go about finding information to help

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,389
progress with coding and trying to find

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,449
and trying to fit it in with other

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,430
problems this also it leads to the

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:49,400
overarching issue of need to reframing

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,650
my thinking about myself and remember

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,650
I'm just starting those 10 plus years at

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:58,389
university don't really relate to all of

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,560
this and I need to relearn how to learn

00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,650
so I came across this little thing of

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,630
fail first attempt in learning and I

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,180
think it really fits well in learning to

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,580
code as you need is you learn the most

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,090
when things go wrong and you need to fix

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,639
them and actually work out how to make

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,190
it do what you want it to do play around

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,819
build things see what's on see what

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,500
works see what doesn't do hands-on stuff

00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:27,940
not sitting there reading a book on

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,099
Python and then trying to do stuff so

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,020
this idea as failing as being important

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:36,260
can be difficult as often we reverse to

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,899
failure it can be confronting upsetting

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,120
and most people don't talk about it now

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,130
this is something that Josh Simmons was

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,560
talking about yesterday and Kate Pierce

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,620
discussed last month in her keynote and

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,829
unrest con we need to be more vocal

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,480
about failure as most of the learning is

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,510
done by failure

00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,800
it's like we learn and we grow when we

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:04,100
fail and it's just something we don't

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,230
discuss there isn't much discussion of

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,840
the weeks we spent staring at or hacking

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,790
on problems wandering what we missed why

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,970
it isn't doing what it's supposed to do

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,360
and then suddenly that realization oh it

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,120
was that thing there was you know this

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,600
thing I mistyped that why did I not see

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,940
that before we talk about successes but

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,510
not the journey of failures that led to

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,950
that success

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,890
but in this style of learning through

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,160
failure you also come across error

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,720
messages which is Tim door born from

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,130
grok learning was talking about the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,670
other month that the Sydney Python

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,810
Meetup

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:48,350
they can be somewhat unhelpful probably

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,930
definitely was occurred there ABS but

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,840
being a new person and just having

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,800
bright red syntax error invalid syntax

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,900
is really unhelpful I was talking about

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,190
this to my partner and they said I don't

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,720
know what you're talking about

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,770
you just copy and paste it into Google

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,690
and you have your answer and having

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,900
working in tech support googling error

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,000
messages was not something new to me

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:18,320
however answers and help you get from

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,680
like Cisco VPN and windows mam errors is

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,110
very different to programming windows

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,860
Aero guides you're dealing with UI and

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,300
navigating that and it's not so bad

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,760
programming answers however start using

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,040
words that I don't know the meaning and

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,050
context of for example of rayon matrix a

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,910
month and a half ago I was talking over

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,290
a problem I was stuck on with my partner

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,760
and they said oh you probably want to

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,020
build an array or matrix and I'm like

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,250
what what's that and they explained and

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,340
when they were referring to what they

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,400
were referred to and I was like oh I did

00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,320
that like two years ago in Coursera but

00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,510
they didn't use that terminology it's

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,980
just something new there's this

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,740
completely different use of language

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,260
involved and searching what these terms

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,190
means can be troublesome as they just

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,260
lead to article

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,990
filled with more technical jargon that

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,070
can be that can be overwhelming and you

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:20,030
see this in old fields so word function

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:22,580
so in everyday use it's like an activity

00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:25,850
that is natural to or the purpose of a

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,650
personal thing a relation or expression

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,200
involving one or more variables now

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,750
that's maths and if we use it as a verb

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,270
work or operate in a proper or

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,820
particular way if we're working to

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,710
program it with regard to programming a

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,780
function is a block of organized

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,180
reusable code that is used to perform a

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,190
single related action functions provide

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,380
better modularity of your application

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,000
and a high degree of code reusing and

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,770
that's not even getting on to the

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,790
definition of functional programming

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:59,030
from the Python Docs website now from

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,340
religion transcendent function religion

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,590
provides medium through which people are

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,840
able to experience God the numinous or

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,260
transcendent and that's one of three

00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,260
uses of function definitions to describe

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,520
a functional religion if you're using

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,840
functional religion as your means of

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,220
defining religion so concepts of words

00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,130
having different uses in different

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,830
fields is understandable but excessive

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,770
use of these words is a problem as it

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:31,100
effectively gate keeps a subject area to

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,680
newcomers and it is intimidating these

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:38,510
these use of words in a way that I'm

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,710
unfamiliar with so I'm talking about

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,910
these problems but what about solutions

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,350
firstly I think we need to normalize

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,820
failure it is a path to learning more

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,160
about what you are doing we learn from

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:57,530
our mistakes and we are always going to

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,670
make mistakes we are always going to yep

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,680
always gonna make mistakes

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,690
on a sidenote and ensures that we

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,540
understand the greats in our field are

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,200
fallible and human we need more plumbers

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,360
and less rockstars

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,120
also I think teaching people different

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,490
ways to problem-solve coming from

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,520
humanities I haven't really had to do

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,680
much hands-on problem solving and how do

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,570
organized information is how to organize

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,030
information in chapters what's going to

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,460
flow best where to put things

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,980
now it's how do I make this code do what

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,870
I want it to do so personally I

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,240
personally enjoyed visualization through

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,390
getting pen and paper out writing bits

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,720
of pseudocode drawing lines to bits and

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,280
pieces and it's like noting to people

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,560
that there are these different ways to

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,630
work through problems talking to a duck

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,450
or teddy bear reading your code

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,580
backwards giving people tools to help

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,770
themselves but also being a sounding

00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,690
board to people providing community

00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:03,000
normalizing things that normalizing that

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,720
things don't always work and that stuff

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,690
takes time and also I think that we need

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,610
to know that words that your field users

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,030
and how they can be simplified or

00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,250
explain in layman's term analogy to make

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,480
it all accessible to those of us that

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,420
hunting you to the field

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,310
this isn't dumbing it down it's making

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,590
the place more welcoming to someone who

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,350
didn't spend the past X years studying

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,540
this field we need to learn and tech

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:37,530
jargon is alienating to people who don't

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:40,110
understand it okay so in addition to all

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,240
of this I think teaching people the code

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,800
is important so one of the things I do

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,450
is I volunteer with the Gould's

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,700
programming network which is based out

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,570
of Sydney Uni and we teach girls how to

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,040
program so this was last weekend but I

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,480
unfortunately didn't make it to that one

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,180
because I was horribly ill and yeah we

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,960
have high school girls or girls from

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:07,530
year 3 onwards turn up and we have a

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:11,340
volunteer thing it's all women and yeah

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:13,110
we teach them so now I might feel that

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,640
this is important because I was not

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,820
taught about computers in high school

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,770
but I also know that if I had I bury

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,110
likely had have had a very different

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,200
journey in life and I might not have

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,720
ended up in tech as the tech world is

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,730
not that great for women and is only

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,490
that I'm here later in life where I have

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,830
a good support network and I'm in a

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,780
better place to deal with

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,570
toxic stuff I come across that I'm able

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,790
to continue on in this path I'm a much

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,570
better place to deal with this than if I

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:46,430
was a 20 year old but I think one of the

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,860
big things I want for people is to be

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,050
exposed to programming early in life so

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,870
they know about it and that it being an

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,480
option for them regardless of what

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,470
direction they might take after

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,750
regarding their studies in career

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,030
knowing the basics of the coding or what

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,100
it is possible to do can help them in

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,800
the future with the Australian

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,570
Curriculum now including programming is

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,070
mandatory subjects from primary school

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,990
onwards this will happen however while I

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,200
believe teaching kids to code and

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,150
exposing them to it I also believe we

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,470
should be encouraging them to engage and

00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,680
understand with various parts of the

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,110
humanities now there are some pieces on

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,280
this and combining them into combining

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,870
humanities and stem or steam and and is

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,640
really important and it is another

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,640
aspect of diversity we need to

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,110
understand and take on we need the

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,000
humanities and stem to come together

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,190
because there is a lot we can learn from

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,270
one another

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,000
humanities peoples are learning to code

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,100
to sift through datasets but where the

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,700
humanities is going to help stem is the

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,890
understanding the human side of things

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:59,080
the article this image is taken from by

00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:03,320
Amy Weber or Sailor Mercury

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,420
discusses this world large historical

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,410
and scientific breakthroughs happen

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,760
because of human emotion and no part of

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:16,880
stem work is free from the human element

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,480
all of your data is biased because your

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,230
algorithms are biased why because a

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,510
human wrote them so there needs to be

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,790
this connection with humanities to have

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:34,070
the tools to analyze and critique this

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:39,410
information so where I would like to end

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:40,970
this is that we are all here because we

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,420
are in some way related to tech and

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,690
coding but please remember that other

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,960
fields bring important things to the

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,870
- so sure encourage people to learn to

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,360
code and use tech but don't do it in a

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,790
way that will discourage them from

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,310
looking at other different fields and

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,350
maybe do something about helping to

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,120
break down those barriers and walls that

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,430
have been built up between stem and

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:19,040
humanities cuz they're really terrible

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:21,470
and toxic thank you okay thank you

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,740
Lauren we have some time for questions

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:33,220
right now so anybody would ask some

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:36,140
questions - Lauren yep what kind of

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:39,320
computational theology or biblical

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:46,100
studies or text your analysis projects

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:51,800
have really impressed you so using

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:54,320
computation and yeah - for in that

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,810
theology context when you were doing

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,620
theology how much were you exposed to

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:03,590
there of researchers using computers to

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:07,840
solve theological problems so that

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,840
hasn't really been happening okay yeah

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:17,480
any other questions

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:19,760
yep one second um I really enjoyed your

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,000
talk I've had a very similar journey to

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,220
you I've come from a biology PhD started

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,960
learning Python a couple of years ago so

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,370
I actually merely sit submitted a very

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,490
similar talk so I'm really glad you did

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,490
it

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,820
what's next for you are you gonna stay

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,170
in humanities are you gonna move into

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:42,380
programming so I have a couple of

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:44,750
projects that I want to do so if I look

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,180
at the field that I did and the stuff

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,120
that I did for my PhD I can't really

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,890
apply a lot of Python coding to what I

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,460
did because it's very visual based it's

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,830
very you need to I ball it but moving

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,059
forward I do want to do some web

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:04,619
scraping and textual analysis and

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:07,279
things like looking at local newspapers

00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:10,169
that are online and actually looking at

00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,599
negative versus positive language use

00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:16,019
when particular religions are mentioned

00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:19,139
and then also correlating that with the

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:21,419
demographics of that area and also just

00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:28,590
general perceptions that come out of

00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:32,399
that area regarding religions and come

00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:37,169
to you later hi thanks for that I

00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:39,769
appreciate your comment about women who

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,089
coming into tech maybe later in life

00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,799
perhaps being better prepared to deal

00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,239
with tech and you know having a better

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,889
support network I think that's a really

00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:53,190
valuable insight because there is so

00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:55,559
much focus on throwing more girls into

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,139
the funnel as Russell talked about this

00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,739
morning do you know of any programs in

00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:03,929
Australia that are targeted towards

00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:06,989
women like maybe doing a career change

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:18,509
or like a little bit older transitioning

00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:20,369
into tech I was just wondering if you

00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:23,099
are familiar with the software carpentry

00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,239
stuff aimed at research scientists and

00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:27,210
whether something like that could

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:37,619
potentially be adapted for humanities

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:42,239
research and it's like it is like we are

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,950
seeing like an uptick in use of code and

00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,869
things in things like sociology because

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,419
they've got those datasets and stuff

00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:50,669
that they need to go through I know

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,099
someone that's moved from like doing

00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:55,109
sociology of religion stuff and they're

00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:58,589
big teaching themselves are and Pythian

00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:02,219
so I think that that kind of thing would

00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:03,960
actually be quite useful I'm sorry just

00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:05,639
to add to that the University of

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,799
Melbourne has a research platforms which

00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:09,629
teaches digital humanities and you can

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,170
do software carpentry courses on natural

00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:15,250
language processing

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,930
and various other tools and tips and it

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,030
was started by someone who did a PhD in

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:31,570
Roman history and then taught herself

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:34,150
Python and our um thanks Lauren that was

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:37,420
really inspiring

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,540
um just a quick comment for the person

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,750
who asked about support networks for

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,930
women getting into coding and um I'm in

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,720
the same boat in Melbourne there's a

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:54,880
fantastic organization called geek girl

00:22:49,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Academy which is about encouraging girls

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:05,080
and women to learn about all things

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,530
coding and simulated in Sydney we've got

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,150
well I think this is more general women

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:15,940
who code have chapters in different

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:19,330
cities and there's also geek girl

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,180
dinners which I've been to a few of in

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:26,230
Sydney and the girls programming network

00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:29,890
that Lauren and I and Amanda and a few

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:33,030
other people here volunteer at in Sydney

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,730
is looking at expanding to other states

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,260
I know that they've talked about

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,840
organizing it in Canberra and Brisbane

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,620
I'm not sure if anyone in Melbourne is

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:49,270
interested in supporting that as well

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:51,580
but there are definitely some movements

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,810
now to support more more women who want

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:59,050
to get into what's been very

00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:04,110
traditionally a male-dominated field so

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,110
thanks yeah anyone else

00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,880
nope

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:13,090
said it okay Lauren one more thing yep

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,250
on behalf of PyCon Australia 2016 I'd

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,670
like to present you a small gift for

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,670
your talk

00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:25,270
yep thank you for your time one more

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,270
