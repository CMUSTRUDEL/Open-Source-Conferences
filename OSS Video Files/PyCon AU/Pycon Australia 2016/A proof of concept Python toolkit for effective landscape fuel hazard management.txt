Since the 2009 Victorian Bushfires there has been a major funding increase to allow fuel reduction burns in national parks in NSW. The first recommendation (Review of performance targets for bushfire fuel management on public land 2015) is that the government moves towards a risk reduction target rather than the current hectarue target. An evidentiary method of proposing burns based on ISO 31000 Risk management - principles and guidelines (2009) was built into a manual workflow using Esri's ArcGIS suite. The next step was to automate the process as much as possible. To do this we built a suite of tools using Python in ArcGIS and in Pandas. This meant that we could spend more time making sure our calculations were correct and we understood the data rather than spending time re-creating ways to read tables and perform calculations.

In this talk we'll cover the suite of tools we built and a workflow for a user, and what this means for environmental policy in the department and NSW. We'll talk about ways we step between automation and using tools like Excel which our Environmental managers are very familiar with, but which don't always lend themselves to consistent input. And we'll talk about how building this suite not only does the calculations for us, but also records the metadata at every step along the trail, so we can provide evidence of how we made our decisions.

so our next speaker is a hurry wall sure

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,679
i hope i pronounced it up correctly and

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:13,280
he had he hits the spatial vision

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,900
enterprise gia s development team

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,430
designing developing implementing and

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
supporting especially based software

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,699
systems and in his spare time can we

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,939
passionate about GIS button and spatial

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,820
technology so you really love your job

00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,189
so please welcome Henry and histo John

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,320
starting fires in national parks a

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,420
proof-of-concept python toolkit for

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:46,739
effective landscape fuel hazard

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:49,039
management all right I reckon hear me

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,250
wonderful all right so we all know

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,350
Australia is a fire prone country so

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,859
thanks to nathan from the speech

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,449
beforehand but certainly from my

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,539
experience these are a couple of the

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,539
examples

00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,830
now we all have a personal connection to

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,480
fire the community in Australia I'm i

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,840
think luckier than most i've been

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,360
involved in in some way at least three

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,490
major fires have had significant effects

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,270
on my life so when I was growing up

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,440
quick little personal history for me

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,880
just before I started University I was

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,670
down here in Melbourne on holidays over

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,370
the Christmas break and the 2003 camera

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,180
bush fires broke out now again I'm very

00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,190
lucky so no one in my family was hurt no

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,740
one was harmed no one lost their homes

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,330
but I know other people that did and I

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,380
had a profound effect on me because I

00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,510
could still remember the day that I

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,980
tried to call home find out what was

00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,660
happening and couldn't get through on

00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,460
the telephone line you know that's

00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,390
that's always stuck with me and that's

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,010
been a long time since so when I started

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,180
my first job I was working at Geoscience

00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:07,580
Australia back up in camera as well and

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,380
in 2006 there were again over the

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,650
Christmas break Australia you know the

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,050
convenience summer we had fires down

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,830
here in Victoria in banana and again I

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,959
said I decided that if anything I could

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,730
do I would and it turned out that they

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,250
needed some volunteers to come down and

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,110
help out with bushfire mapping so being

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,870
a GIS person being a bit of a map third

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,360
and being someone than there was you

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,700
know at least interested enough to get

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,700
involved with the whole process and

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,160
wanted to see what I could do to help I

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,040
came down and I spend some time with the

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,830
vibra gade or the cfa up and Piniella

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,480
helping the map fire extents during that

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,400
bushfire event and of course I wasn't

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,870
the only one there and it wasn't

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,520
organized by me was organized by

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,440
Geoscience Australia but it was a really

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,200
valuable experience for me I really

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,250
shaped the way that I think about

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,000
emergency management and disaster

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:05,690
management in Australia so flash forward

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,430
to the 2009 black saturday bushfires of

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,930
course still at the time I was up in

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,970
camera but I was involved in a group

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,430
called the maps group which was the

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,840
mapping and planning support which is

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,700
just a volunteer organization in the

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,440
acct and we worked with the emergency

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,849
services to

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,319
provide mapping assistance when it was

00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,030
needed so we worked with search and

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,890
rescue and with fire brigade in the acct

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,700
and of course the black saturday

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,900
bushfires obviously was a huge event

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,420
it's a tragic event because so many

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,340
people lost their lives so I volunteered

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,459
and I came down to Victoria to help with

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,569
the recovery event and this is my photo

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,580
but it's one of the very similar images

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,780
to what my memory of those events were I

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,360
came down to help with the recovery

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,280
effort with operation worlds so I didn't

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,830
see the fire myself i sat in a police

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,269
station up in King link I saw a lot of

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,980
burnt trees and truly had a I won't say

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,910
happy experience or exciting experience

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,400
but it was a very enlightening

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,620
experience and again it's really shaped

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
the way that I think about dealing with

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,260
fire and thinking about dealing with

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,500
emergency management and it really is

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,819
something that I'm passionate about and

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,340
in a very real way it's the reason I'm

00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,750
here today because without the 2009

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,389
fires I wouldn't have moved to Melbourne

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,740
after that point I decided that no it

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,380
was time for me to move on I came down

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,030
here moved to Melbourne started with DSC

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,100
before moving on to a consulting so I'm

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,710
here to talk to you about starting fires

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,410
in national parks which is an exciting

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,669
topic and probably pretty controversial

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,140
one of the big things in Australia is

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,810
that fire is an important part of our

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,000
natural landscape it's part of the life

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,070
cycle of our native forests and many

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,830
species in our native forests actually

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,150
require fire regularly to reproduce if

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,250
we didn't have fire in Australian

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,500
forests then we wouldn't have Australian

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,120
forest so we have some banks ears for

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,190
example which require the heat of the

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,840
fire to drop their seeds and to

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,030
reproduce we have species of eucalyptus

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,470
they require the soot from the fire the

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,990
smoke to actually trigger the

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,810
reproduction cycle and then we have

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,370
others species again which will rely on

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,070
the ash in the soil for the seed

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,430
germination so it's an important part of

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,289
our natural landscape and obviously we

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,479
can't prevent fires all together there's

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:28,780
two main courses in a fires in Australia

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,430
we have naturally occurring fires which

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,500
tend to come from lightning strikes and

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,330
then we have the human occurring fires

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,889
and those we can do better at preventing

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,900
in

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,580
Hazel's we want to in other cases which

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,780
is what I'm talking about today we don't

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,749
want to so what I'm talking about today

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,539
is hazard reduction burning now has a

00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:53,379
reduction burning is an important step

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:56,169
in forest management in Australia so one

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,460
of our projects this year with the

00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,439
company that I work for now spatial

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,599
vision we've been working with Parks and

00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,400
Wildlife near South Wales and one of

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,169
their responsibilities among other

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,389
departments in New South Wales is to

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,680
perform a hazard reduction burns hazard

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,250
reduction burns if you don't know what

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,169
they are are a very controlled way of

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:19,000
reducing fire fuel load in the

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:20,680
environment the idea is that by using

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,330
the knowledge that we have of the

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,650
natural environment as well as our

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,110
knowledge of the fuel loads in the area

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,789
we can send teams in to reduce those few

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,159
loads so if there is a fire later in the

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:35,919
year during fire season that fire won't

00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:37,599
have as much of an effect the idea of

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,219
the definition of a controlled burn and

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,319
we'll read this out or I'm sorry I can't

00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:43,900
ever get these things memorized is it's

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,210
the controlled application of fire under

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,789
specified environmental conditions to a

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,180
predetermined area and at the time

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:54,159
intensity and rate of spread required to

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,479
attain planned resource management

00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:00,250
outcomes so the basic idea here with any

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,909
hazard reduction burn is it's an

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,830
efficient way of reducing the fuel mass

00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,149
within a particular region and in

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:12,370
general we're looking at of course

00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:15,370
national parks in the acct sorry in

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,719
Australia not the acct so legal

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,669
responsibility for hazard reduction

00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:21,909
burns essentially the New South Wales

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:23,469
Fire Act 1997 outlines the duties of

00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:26,199
public authorities and owners and

00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:27,819
occupiers of lands to prevent bushfires

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,500
but essentially there are four main

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,539
agencies in New South Wales that have to

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,159
deal with hazard reduction burns and

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,889
bushfires you have obviously the office

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,360
of environment and heritage you have new

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,490
south wales National Parks and Wildlife

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,930
Service you have the Rural Fire Service

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,669
in New South Wales and you have fire and

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,009
rescue New South Wales who are the

00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:47,220
metropolitan fire service agency in

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:50,100
Sydney and in the surrounding region

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,200
and one of the big things in your South

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,510
Wales particularly recently is that

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,680
there's a ongoing commitment to hazard

00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,300
reduction burns in a way that allows new

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,480
south wales and as well as you know any

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,890
other states that adopt this practice to

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,620
minimize the loss of property minimize

00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,730
the loss of life from an unplanned fire

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,900
event so you have for example

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,760
recommendations from the one belong fire

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,440
inquiry to the New South Wales

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,940
Government which essentially says that

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,220
the new south wales government must

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,650
supply funding for hazard reduction bill

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,650
burns across New South Wales to reduce

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,300
risk to life and property a lot of this

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,130
came out of the fire up in the blue

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,050
mounds which we saw the video of earlier

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:38,490
and but also of course the results of

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:41,880
the 2009 bushfire royal commission so we

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,830
have best practices in bushfire

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,360
management and it turns out actually for

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,150
us in Melbourne the best practices are

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,280
here in Victoria one of the biggest

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,710
things in Victoria is obviously after

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,670
the 2009 bushfires we have the bushfires

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,960
Royal Commission and a lot of the Royal

00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,520
Commission results have been implemented

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,920
here in Victoria and we have a lot of

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,080
ongoing studies a lot of ongoing work by

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,020
very dedicated people into how we can

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,700
manage bushfires effectively so Victoria

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,440
the inspector general for emergency

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,990
management has recommended risk

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,420
reduction targets as the most effective

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,910
form of performance target for bushfire

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,460
fuel management and this is as opposed

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,589
to just a simple hech hair target for

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,690
burn management so originally New South

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:28,020
Wales New South Wales has a current five

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,030
percent target of burn management so the

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,920
idea is that for all national parks in

00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,960
New South Wales they want to burn five

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,350
percent of the area of those national

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,750
parks every year to reduce fuel the

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,640
problem is at the moment at least in New

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,430
South Wales there hasn't been enough

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,410
work into looking at the areas they're

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,660
burning to reduce risk the air is they

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,950
burning it's worked by the different

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,240
management units in the different

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,040
regions and I'll show you just how much

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,790
of an area we're looking at in just a

00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,720
moment but unfortunately because there's

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,209
no true risk analysis method there's no

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,569
method that they can use any other Wells

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:09,899
to say to people okay this is why we're

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,699
burning this particular region what's

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:15,209
tended to happen is that the high-risk

00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:17,730
areas the high areas which people from

00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,930
their knowledge of the area from their

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,029
understanding from their work in the

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,040
field have dealt with before 10 to get

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,170
bird over and over again as part of that

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,120
five percent fuel reduction load and we

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,509
don't want that because surprisingly

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,269
forests tend to grow and as far as screw

00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:34,949
more fuel is produced so I give you a

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,529
quick look at the scale of the area

00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:40,459
we're looking at okay so this is

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,279
obviously new south wales all of these

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:47,250
orange and blobs are essentially burn

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:50,430
unit areas so every National Park in New

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,930
South Wales is made up in terms of fire

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,930
management from the Parks and Wildlife

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,519
perspective at least of a series of burn

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:03,269
units so in these Burnett's there are if

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,860
it helps 14.5 thousand burn units across

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,600
New South Wales these are managed by

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,990
different fire management groups there

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,620
are 89 thousand square kilometers of

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,949
land in New South Wales so that's not an

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,160
insignificant area ok these are defined

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:23,129
as asset protection zones ap Zeds

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,139
spazzes or strategic fire advantage

00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,949
zones and land management zones and

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,209
really for us here doing this work now

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,639
what those actually mean don't matter

00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,709
too much but what they are is

00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,009
essentially areas of increasing

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:39,209
importance so a apz is an asset

00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,699
protection zone which basically says

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,829
this is the zone around your house that

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,360
you need to have clear with minimized

00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,569
fuel so that when there is a fire that

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,839
comes through your house is at a much

00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:54,329
reduced risk a spaz is essentially the

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,639
same thing for other assets whereas a

00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,949
Land Management zone tends not to have

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:04,500
as much strategic importance attached to

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:06,240
it so what do we do part of the role of

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,240
bushfire unit managers is to classify

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,610
risk so if you're in an area that is

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,439
prone to fire or if you're managing

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,520
these national parks you need to be able

00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,490
to say which

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,680
areas of these national parks are more

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:23,010
at risk of fire and how can we control

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,140
it and how can we use our limited budget

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:30,660
and time that has a reduction burns to

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,050
do our burns or do the work that we need

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:39,570
to do as much as possible and the basic

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:43,320
idea here is to rank burns oh so that we

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:47,100
have or back burn unit boundaries rank

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,780
burn unit boundaries so that we can say

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,340
this burning in a boundary at this

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,920
particular time with this particular

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,650
fuel load is of more importance for us

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,110
to control to manage then this other

00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,740
burn unit boundary over here and of

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,210
course this is very subjective but it

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,890
does come from a very hard science

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,660
background we have very good models

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,050
large scale models across New South

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,090
Wales of fire fuel loads obviously we

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,130
have very good simulations of fire fuel

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,960
loads as well or the spread of fire the

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,400
likelihood of the spread of fire and we

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,020
have a very good idea of the

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,530
environmental risk as well as the

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:26,070
strategic risk of particular zones so we

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,600
can rank things and in general a very

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,980
easy way to rank things from a risk

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,800
modeling perspective is a simple

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,500
one-to-five scale basically one is

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,690
low-risk five is high risk and we can

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,760
combine any two particular combinations

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,220
of risk for example strategic value

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,500
which says you know is this particular

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,810
piece of land more important to prevent

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,700
having an uncontrolled fire event than

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,250
another particular land piece of lab and

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:54,630
fuel load to give us a simple ranking of

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:58,830
1 to 25 and so we get something like

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,030
this so get a simple risk matrix now if

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,530
you've done any risk management before

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,110
this should be probably pretty familiar

00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:05,910
to you and the values here are pretty

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,770
arbitrary down the left-hand side we

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,400
have the likelihood the strategic value

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:14,210
will be achieved which basically says

00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,490
based on the amount of fuel in this area

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,100
5 being lots and lots of fuel 1 being

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,140
not as much fuel if that stays the same

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,490
what is the likelihood that the

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,140
strategic outcome or no rug burns is

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,610
going to be achieved and

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,380
the top we have the impact on strategy

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,030
outline so essentially this is the

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,250
lowest strategic value to the highest

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,930
row teaching value do we care about this

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,340
piece of land as much as we care about

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:47,850
it on the piece of land okay and based

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,090
on that simple 25 scale 1 to 25 scale we

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,790
can go further we can classify fire our

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,190
fire risk levels into essentially levels

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,200
that are acceptable risk it's a

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,590
conditional risk or it's a completely

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,530
unacceptable risk so the idea here is to

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,480
have a look at the areas that we have

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,520
and an unacceptable risk says that

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,580
within the next fire season within the

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,460
next cycle we would prefer all this

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,410
should be have a fire reduction fuel

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,510
management burden take place where as a

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,100
conditional is if possible we'd like to

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,740
do some fire management fuel reduction

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,480
burns and an acceptable risk is of

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,730
course somewhere where we don't actually

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,470
need to prioritize a fire risk burn at

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,150
this time so you can start with some

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,930
pretty sensible cut-offs we can actually

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,700
do some very simple calculations okay we

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,850
can have a look at statewide values for

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,280
fire risk so we have fire risk from 12

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,440
23 here because that's currently based

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,910
on current modeling what fire risk is in

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,920
national parks in New South Wales within

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,870
these billion years and we can make some

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,050
reasonable assumptions we can say that

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,290
you know a fire risk level of 11 or

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:59,700
below is probably acceptable at a fire

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:01,920
risk level of 21 or higher is almost

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,710
certainly unacceptable and we want to be

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,330
able to do something about that so you

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,460
get a very simple modeling here although

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,440
I think the numbers are a bit out thank

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,650
you so we have a divide between

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,730
unacceptable conditional and acceptable

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,220
so I haven't mentioned any Python in

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,020
this talk so far I've mentioned all

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,690
policy and a lot of decisions about

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,460
science but I'll start talking about the

00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,290
Python now and the reason that we want

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:33,120
to start talking about the Python now is

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:35,190
because currently to go from a simple

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,630
risk model with two values in fact we

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,190
have several different models of risk

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,620
for environmental values strategic

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,060
values fuel values and so on there's

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,450
actually a 16 step manual

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,510
us to actually get through from a risk

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,640
model through to a planned and evaluated

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,530
burn program for the next three years

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,920
which is the way that New South Wales

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,750
parks and wildlife works okay and you'll

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,550
note there sixteen is a bit of a lie

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,460
there's a few more than 16 because we

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,860
have things like 6 a-6 basic see but

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,050
really what we're actually doing here in

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,120
this project is to try and reduce the

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,070
overhead and reduce the likelihood for

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,210
human error for mistakes when we're

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,530
actually doing these kind of risk

00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,960
calculations we want to make this as

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,700
simple as possible and in a sense run

00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,160
simulations so we ought to be able to

00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,660
take a look at different scenarios say

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
that this level is unacceptable this

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,690
level is acceptable do this quickly

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,220
without people having to sit there in

00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,420
front of a computer manually typing in

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,130
numbers and doing these manual

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,870
calculations ok so I'll give you a quick

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,350
squiz now this is the bit of mind

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,050
everything it's a bit risky come on work

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,210
yes ok so i can show you a tool that's

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,800
running this is the first part of one of

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,060
the tools we actually built in arcgis

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,590
there we go this doesn't run very long

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,670
this is actually around the barrera

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,830
Valley State Park New South Wales and

00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,940
you can see here the based on a couple

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:02,460
of simple risk levels what we've done is

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,140
write a quick solution and hopefully

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,590
this little read role correctly come on

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,310
yeah there we go we've run a very quick

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,800
solution that calculates an acceptable

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,420
unacceptable and conditional values

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,610
based on the user input so you'll note

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,490
there that took about 10 seconds to one

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,870
that was just recorded on my laptop here

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,780
so this is not a particularly difficult

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,330
calculation to perform but it is an

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,220
issue where if you're doing it manually

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,810
it's very time consuming if you can do

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,460
it in an automated way it's actually

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,010
very very quick because you can do it

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,770
repeatedly it's really simple and the

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,760
reason we're doing this human error is a

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:43,500
problem so human error is us saying that

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,850
I want someone to sit down in front of

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,830
the computer I want someone to sit there

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,630
and record what these burn units are I

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,850
want someone to sit there in something

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,920
like Excel which is basically what

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,810
people have been using up to now sit

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,900
there in Excel and say okay based on

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,120
this risk level based on

00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,100
based on this strategic value based on

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,650
this environmental value this is what

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,380
the overall risk of this area is is this

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,790
acceptable unacceptable conditional and

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,980
one of the biggest issues there is of

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,970
course that that's not repeatable

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,190
depending on who's doing on any given

00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,170
day you have someone sitting there who

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,150
might say that this area is unacceptable

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,610
and they might say that it's conditional

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,900
the next day we need to be able to

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,420
repeat that and that's part of what the

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:30,150
tool that we built was aimed to do so

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:34,830
part of what our outputs excuse me from

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:37,260
this tool have been to record the input

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,330
metadata and that's a key in any kind of

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,890
scientific application but one of the

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,960
key outputs is to record that metadata

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,000
so that any time that they run a model

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,030
any time that someone in that group

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,160
produces an output that is recorded and

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,700
that can be repeated again and it's

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,860
justifiable in terms of the science so

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,560
how do we do it well the first thing to

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,950
remember is that spatial is not special

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,600
as a GIS person I like to think it is

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm a big fan of maps I love playing

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,590
with maps but really it's not actually

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,020
that special from a data analysis point

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,750
of view you look at it spatial data is

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,490
stored as a table so it's pretty much

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,710
like any standard table in a database or

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,890
an Excel the only difference really is

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,120
that we have a geometry on the side so

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,010
we have some piece of location

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,580
information along with it but really all

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:30,480
that is is another data type and for the

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,860
majority for non GIS people to give them

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,070
access to these tools we want to make it

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,870
as simple as possible as an interface so

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,460
we don't want people who don't

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,750
understand how to deal with the spatial

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,480
data how to deal with the tools like

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,760
ArcGIS which you know is huge it's a

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,310
very powerful tool but also has a very

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,060
high barrier of entry we want to make it

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:55,530
as simple as possible so we use thank

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:58,380
you how does we have people still

00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,930
writing their calculations doing their

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,220
initial work in Excel because pandas

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,450
reads and writes Excel very easily and

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,890
it's a very simple way of working with

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,300
tabular data it is the library for it

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,650
we have people I'm more than happy to

00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,270
have someone sit there and do cut their

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,040
own calculations prepare some data in

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,660
Excel and then read it into a system

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,940
like ArcGIS and pandas i would much

00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,140
rather did that in a system that they

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,170
were familiar and comfortable with

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,080
because again that's going to reduce the

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,180
likelihood for human error and one of

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,120
the nice things is if you're familiar

00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,360
with arcgis the primary scripting

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,730
environment of arcgis is python has been

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,880
for many many years now it's Python 2.7

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,410
sadly actually is pro which is the next

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,130
version has Python 3 but at the moment

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:49,070
we're dealing with Python 2.7 but ArcGIS

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,520
10.4 came out late last year around july

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,710
and I've g OS 10.4 for the first time

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,060
has included pandas as one of the

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,060
standard Python libraries that comes

00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,280
with arcgis so we can actually really

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,260
easily incorporate our tools that use

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,230
panders to read tabular data from excel

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:11,270
into our system for GIS data processing

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:13,460
in action is so if you look at it there

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,110
are really four main calculations we

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,750
have a simple calculation for

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:20,990
manipulating GIS data we have some

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:23,150
simple calculations for reading excel

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,430
and csps and then we can classify an

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,230
aggregated data and join join the

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,540
results together now I think I'm

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,770
probably going a little slow soil might

00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,720
pick up the pace quickly but i'll show

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,270
you the only bit of code that i'm going

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,680
to show you in this presentation has to

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,520
be done i'm in a Python conference so I

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,710
have to be able to show you a piece of

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,210
code but this is all the code that you

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:47,840
need to take a arcgis a spatial data

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:50,690
object that is read by the gos arc by

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,540
library and transform that into a usable

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,700
pandas dataframe and as soon as you've

00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,250
got that as soon as you've got a

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,440
dataframe there is a gist up on github

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,050
that I posted I think on Thursday or

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,220
Friday last week so get the address

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,760
there's a bit more error check in the

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,440
gist but take this you can use this and

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,060
then as soon as you've got some data in

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,560
ArcGIS and soon as you got some tabular

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,730
data from somewhere else you can

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,890
actually start to mash it together using

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,660
panners and that's everyone here as

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,120
Python developers knows this this is out

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,890
of the box it's pretty easy to join data

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,080
into minute polite data and pandas

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,260
doing it this way allows us to do that

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,200
really quickly and really fast okay and

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,790
it you know very quickly I won't go

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,440
through the output too much but we

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,450
updates facial features we can symbolize

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,980
it we can update Excel table so we can

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:43,200
log things out to a file so I'll give

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,540
you a quick example of exactly what

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,550
we've done I'll have a look at the proof

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,100
of concept that we did up in New South

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:53,310
Wales for the browser and national park

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,900
so what we have here is per hour these

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,760
are the burn unit sin barreras the dark

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,760
orange points so this is just north of

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,020
sydney this is about if you were to

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,810
drive there it's about an hour and a

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,850
half drive from sydney central up to

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,410
barrera and that's sort of in reasonable

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:12,090
traffic so it's not a long way from the

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:14,880
CBD okay we know that for example we

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:17,040
have current risks New South Wales parks

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,810
and wildlife service updates file fuel

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,700
load estimations on a regular basis and

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,160
it's a very simple way to convert that

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,170
from all that fuel load measurement tool

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,430
one-to-five scale basically you can

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,860
think of it as anything with more than

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,530
12 tons of fuel per hectare gets a 5

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,940
risk that's a lot of fuel but obviously

00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,920
depending on the type of vegetation you

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,280
can get more than that so anything above

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,410
that is a huge risk and of course NPWS

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,610
has their own strategic values for all

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,780
of these burn units as well they've

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,190
already been classified they've known

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,620
about this data for years so we want to

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,110
just make this as easy as possible we

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,930
can see here in barrera this is the

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:56,040
simple one-to-five scale red bean risk

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:58,310
risky green being not so much of fuel

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,120
loads and we have here strategic values

00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,850
so if you remember the graph I showed

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,110
you before we can do the same thing we

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,190
can calculate our risk values very

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,670
easily and this is one of the outputs of

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:12,630
the tool that we built five minutes okay

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,370
really to push on through so we can very

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,750
easily calculate just the current risk

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,240
level of this area and we can calculate

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,190
a baseline risk as well this is by the

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,960
way the one two three unacceptable

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,130
acceptable condition based on this and

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,220
this is just the first part of the

00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,190
process but we can also calculate

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,630
baseline risks so we can say that you

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,340
know assuming that every where nothing

00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,780
has been controlled for years assuming

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,640
essentially anything nothing has been

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,419
burnt in that area for ten years we'll

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,739
give you the maximum

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,600
amount of fuel in that region and

00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:41,460
therefore everything units of five so I

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,919
can also compare we can say okay

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,499
compared to our original current fuel

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,359
load what is the baseline risk of course

00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:51,179
we can do that with historical data as

00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,289
well and as well as our predictions one

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,029
of the nice things about doing the tool

00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,519
the way that we did it because we did

00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:59,669
with handlers because the guys on the

00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,639
team not me I'm standing back give them

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,869
the credit who did all the actual work

00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,070
do this so quickly did it so efficiently

00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,629
and because panas is a really easy

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,100
library to work with we actually had

00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:09,389
some extra time in the end which meant

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,090
we could extend that to little bit as

00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:14,970
well which is nice so we can actually

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,519
let people budget for this as well sort

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,710
of the other key outputs for any

00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,999
organization like NPWS when they're

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,629
doing these burns is that these bones

00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:26,249
cost money their risky they take time so

00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:27,899
using this tool instead of them having

00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:29,489
to then sit there with these risks at

00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,840
risk areas and say this is how much

00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:32,999
money is going to cost me to burn these

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,879
areas off I can just be a standard apple

00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:38,279
to the tool as well so the key take

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:41,279
homes basically simple code gets good

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,830
results we make it as simple as possible

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,029
we don't want ownership we want the

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,009
people at Park South Wales to have

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,149
ownership we give them the code they use

00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,759
the tools they're going to be using it

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,230
every day and we don't want people who

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,570
don't have a lot of technical experience

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,850
in writing code or having to write these

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,850
tools you know we don't want that to get

00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,529
in the way of them doing this work the

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,409
other thing obviously maps get people

00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:06,960
talking and we can reduce the time that

00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:08,789
the tool runs from hours to minutes you

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,190
know a manual process takes hours of

00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:15,269
days drop your down takes minutes ok now

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,950
we could of course extend little

00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,509
extending the tools very easy because

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,669
again pandas are very flexible and

00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:22,169
powerful library and dropping in

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,090
something like that fuel calculation

00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,859
sorry the cost calculation is very

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,419
simple to do and we can go back and do

00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,859
other things as well if we decide one

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,210
day that we don't like that five by five

00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:32,220
risk matrix that doesn't give us enough

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,539
detail or it might give us too much we

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,980
can change that because that's just

00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,350
stored as a table it's just soared as a

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,700
table on within the Python file so it's

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,590
really really easy to change it what all

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,960
we're doing is using pandas to do to

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,690
match Taylor up it's what are the next

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,749
steps okay so this year New South Wales

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,879
is running a pilot project for national

00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:53,369
park management areas across New South

00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,840
Wales going to have this same risk

00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:58,049
process run when they're calculating all

00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,970
the bones and the basic idea is we want

00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,139
to get later of people's desktops into a

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,690
database we want to make that azz

00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:06,749
repeatable as possible and we can do

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,859
that with Anders with Python and we can

00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:11,029
do it with simple automation of these

00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:14,249
tools and finally a couple of things

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:16,379
Donnie Kyle from New South Wales Parks

00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:20,070
and Wildlife from the brow routine jeff

00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:21,480
mike tom give a wave and anastasia for

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,549
actually doing the hard yards I get to

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,419
stand up front and look important they

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,519
actually have to do the work and

00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,580
obviously the team behind pandas and

00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,249
last but not least Hannah my wife who

00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:38,359
would kick my ass if I didn't think her

00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:38,359
this presentation any questions

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:53,760
okay I think we have time for one or two

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:57,539
short questions anyone thanks to the

00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,710
great talk no I is there any appetite

00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:03,450
for like a web-based see ideally I mean

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,590
one of the one of the things is that

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,520
there's obviously a key spatial

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,750
component for these kind of tools so for

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,250
the pilot projects they've already got

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,169
up g is within their organization so

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,120
they've already got the heavyweight GIS

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:17,700
application but you want to make this as

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,809
easy easily accessible as possible so

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,510
there's no reason that you couldn't for

00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:23,309
example put that data into a web so make

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,370
a nice little map and let people upload

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,960
a table there so I'd say there would be

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,360
that would be much easier for people it

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,520
will access there's not yet we need to

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,590
run the pilot program first with across

00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,750
the obviously the national parks to say

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,159
that yes this worked no this didn't this

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,669
is what's going to change but once

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,669
that's down then yeah absolutely I honey

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,919
do you know the only member of every you

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:51,570
know the i kamap you know the company

00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:55,380
and she was quiet you know the explosive

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,990
very limited of function / arka map to

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,240
python and the right now though you know

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,980
the they're more serious about the

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,230
Python you know that i have been for a

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,480
number of years so every introduced

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,309
Python inversion line it's very lockdown

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,539
as a basic scripting environment you

00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,250
could do some calculations you could

00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,360
manipulate a bit of data you could run

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,159
the tools that they already had in the

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,840
system now you can do a lot more and

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,030
every time they released a new version

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,740
they open up more of the set of the

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,409
underlying system to python and the

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,330
reason is is basically because pythons

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,770
accessible you don't need to sit there

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,990
and compile you don't need visual studio

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,030
to write in arcobjects so for ESRI

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,880
they've got a much much larger uptake of

00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,860
Python in arcgis than I think even they

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,970
were expecting so they've just been

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,559
opening up more and more which has been

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,059
really great to see so you can see that

00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,770
they've been including other libraries

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,600
all sorts in there and the libraries

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,890
these days are actually quite powerful

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,690
we can do things like symbolizing data

00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:51,360
properly all the rest okay I think we

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,440
run out of time we thank you once more

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,990
time on

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,990
