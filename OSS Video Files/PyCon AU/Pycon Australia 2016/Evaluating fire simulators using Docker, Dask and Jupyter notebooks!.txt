Bushfires are one of the most destructive forces in our environment. A major responsibility of the Bureau of Meteorology is to provide information on weather conditions that could make bushfires difficult to fight. Fire agencies then use simulators of fire behaviour to inform finer grained warnings to protect the Australian public. Objectively choosing the best performing simulators, or indeed the best versions of the same simulator, with respect to end-user requirements is a difficult task that requires a large amount of computation. 

The introduction of new tools like Docker, Dask and Jupyter notebooks make the task of large scale computation much easier! The Bureau of Meteorology is looking at these technologies to help modernise its legacy workflows and processes, one example is our recent work in the area of fire simulators.

This talk will work through the approach developed for a reproducible environment (using Docker) and then how we form workflows (jupyter notebooks) that execute fire simulators on a small compute cluster of both windows and linux hosts (Dask, Distributed).  Finally, we will work through an example of scaling up an experiment and demonstrate a process that is easy to replicate and follow for fellow scientists.

yes we have Nathan sajan he joined the

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,450
Center for Australian weather and

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,000
climate research in the strolling Bureau

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,860
of Meteorology to work on the

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,380
development of a national forecasting

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,630
system but now he's working in a weather

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,820
services branch on developing bushfire

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,000
predicted services so i ask you to

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,310
welcome Nathan and his talk evaluating

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,099
fire simulators using docker dusk and

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:33,780
Jupiter notebooks thanks everyone it's

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,190
extremely difficult to follow a really

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,260
good keynote so you'll have to give me a

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,550
little bit of attraction on my talk

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,559
today don't know if people realize this

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,329
but I think like you know it feels like

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,590
every time I come back to Pike on about

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,090
a third of the audience's from the

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,230
Bureau of Meteorology so I can see a

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,289
whole bunch of them sitting over there I

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:57,600
work in the weather services part of the

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,760
bureau it's composed of a few bits I

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,289
thought I'd just throw in a slide to to

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,610
basically say what this view where the

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,189
program is that I work on so I'm a part

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,100
of severe weather services that's part

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,890
of a program we basically define

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,630
forecast policy and services that that

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,790
go out through other divisions and it

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,180
developed by other divisions to provide

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,500
services to the public the part of the

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,729
severe where the program I mean is

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,460
actually responsible for tropical

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,200
cyclone services the fire weather

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,229
program that's that's where I sort of

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,049
fit but also severe storm services this

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,590
is actually just a small amount of what

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,070
we're responsible for by the way today

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,869
the talk i'm going to give you is about

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,030
fire predictive services and how we're

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,420
looking at fire simulators particularly

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,020
fire spread simulators in australia's

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,729
this for that are sort of used by the

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,130
different fire agencies and the bureau

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,920
is interested in how these simulators

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,259
perform because we have a sort of

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,229
obligation to provide weather

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,180
information to these service providers

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:10,229
so that they can help provide really

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,880
good warnings to their public so the

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,280
fire agencies for example

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,500
in Tasmania used a simulator called

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,050
prometheus to simulate fires it's come

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,550
from Canada it's actually because a lot

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,380
of the forest and things like that in

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,600
Tasmania fits pretty well with the

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,830
Canadian forest environment their models

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,960
work really well in Tasmania sorrows

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,110
that develops and fire spread simulation

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,060
models there's a framework called spark

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,100
we're looking at that too there's also

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,450
Phoenix which is particularly popular

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,180
was developed by the University of

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,490
Melbourne that's used in just about

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,020
every part of the fire service around

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,610
Australia except for Western Australia

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,560
where they have their own different

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,030
model called australis that was

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,180
developed by the University of Western

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,350
Australia is basically a slightly

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,150
different approach to modeling the

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,590
spread of fire models so yeah I mean

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,320
severe weather service's I'm not a

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:13,270
research guy or a systems guy but I

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:15,070
dabble see ya y phi is important well

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:20,050
there's a few obvious reasons I think

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:23,020
one they impact the community ok in fact

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,310
in the last couple of years you could

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,080
argue because of climate change and

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,540
things we've started to shift towards an

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,390
environment that's conducive of huge

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,700
wildfires an example I've got up on the

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,000
screen here which was graciously

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,390
provided by David Ross Ron is a photo of

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,740
the blue mountains lithgow fire just

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,220
some interesting facts that that fire

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:49,300
built for about 10 days but 55 thousand

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:53,530
hectares and on a single day it ran more

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,630
than 25 kilometers okay that's

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,160
terrifying I mean if you were in in this

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,510
Township here and you looked at that

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,110
mountain you'd probably run the other

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,530
direction as quickly as you could write

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:08,170
so we need to get better at determining

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,390
when the weather is bad how likely is it

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,370
that an event like this will occur and

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,840
the bureau's in the game of providing

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,880
the weather intelligence to the fire

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,620
agencies and the fire agencies are in

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,910
the game of picking up the simulators

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,950
and the weather intelligence in and

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,919
saying hey everybody we should evacuate

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,510
that town or or at least we should be

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,000
thinking about the possibility of events

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,440
like this occurring

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,139
I've got a nice little video that I've

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,780
picked up from catalyst which sort of

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:37,389
hammers home again why it's important to

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,470
start thinking about fire behavior so

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,070
I'll put it on now and hopefully the

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,560
audio and everything is good I apologize

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,889
for some of the language in this

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,139
presentation but you'll understand why

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,950
the guy says the thing is that he says

00:04:50,139 --> 00:05:05,280
oh let's see if I can make this thing

00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:05,280
play doesn't want it just one sec

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:24,150
if everybody could get off the internet

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:26,160
that would be great Oh someone did at

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,800
the bottom of the mountain directly

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,810
below the clouds of quieting ducts and

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,639
lounge

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,400
with the ground cleared around his house

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,320
Jim barova feels safe enough to arm

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,130
himself with nothing more than a video

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,539
camera passes

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,030
anyone got a chance it's something like

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:49,880
may you know I haven't got to treat up

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,250
to the house things like that so I

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,680
thought I'd be following but then it

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,180
when they're for my car it was nothing

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,180
all like I expected it to

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,970
always show more trials

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,050
if like all the trees were exploding

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:29,260
from heat people say is to leave to know

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,780
the heat of the ordinal a big lips and

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,850
just got off a network gasps going off

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,760
to burning like crazy the gases from the

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,460
evil industries are escaping so quickly

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,889
that they race upwards mixed with the

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,020
air and explode

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,750
the five is feeding itself

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,740
the flames four times the height of the

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,740
20-metre trees

00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,010
as a staff climbing up the hill just

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,290
starts accelerating faster and faster

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,660
just builds up his momentum it's just

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,090
eating everything in why it was just

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,080
like you in real a hurricane it wasn't

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,880
our account but it was on fire so this

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,830
debris going everywhere it was not

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,450
bolted down or something was in the air

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,450
flying around it was going to hit you

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,130
the fire tornado is now developed

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:28,160
ripping through tens of acres in seconds

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:31,490
and we'll be on 1000 degrees it makes an

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,190
other of Earth and there

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,640
this firestorm can now kill from 200

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,640
meters

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,229
just to be on the brick pillar out there

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,709
and there's no way if you pretend like

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:58,089
that remember it just it was like a

00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,089
premium in front of our furnace

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,510
I realized there was a problem with the

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,540
air Ellsbury I wasn't breathing properly

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:12,780
the fire is less than 300 meters away

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,780
gyms in danger not of being burnt to

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,969
death but of suffocating

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,309
but he's go back up man

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,360
and also I've got to get out of here and

00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:25,969
I've got to get to the Parker

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,590
I to step out into the storm with my

00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,629
back to it it's all hitting me on the

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,870
back and I walked past the side of the

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,860
house into the bunker I shut the door

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,909
whatever was going to happen was going

00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,909
to happen I could have stopped it

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,510
the fire sweeps over Jim and he survived

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:53,420
jim was very lucky and possibly also

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:58,760
extremely stupid for putting himself in

00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,490
that environment so just flip over to

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,380
the next thing so that video I think

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,810
should give you an impact of of why it's

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,760
important to understand fire behavior I

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,250
mean there were some things in there

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,490
that we can't currently still define so

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,320
fire tornado how does that form how to

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,860
describe the physics that's around a

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,779
fire tornado if you have all these

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,490
different types of heterogeneous fuels

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,640
like different trees they burn at

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,170
different rates they generate actually

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,560
they can generate their own weather and

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,410
they can influence the fire again fire

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,400
simulators are about trying to pull some

00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,400
of the the knowledge that we've

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,589
developed over the last 50 or so years

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,000
into an automatic I guess framework I

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,110
guess you could think of a simulator as

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,420
a bag of fire models and automating the

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,250
process that we go through to

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,200
effectively sort of war game what's

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,450
going to happen if the weather's bad and

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,670
the fire starts where will it spread how

00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:00,100
quickly will it spread how many people

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:02,029
will influence fire simulators model

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,670
characteristics of fire spatially

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,589
they're still pretty simple and and

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,420
there's a sort of development of the

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,910
science that seeing us want to include

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,100
more weather in how the simulators

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,800
actually work so that for example in the

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,000
future we might have whether numerical

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,640
weather prediction model that actually

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,959
burns fires inside it but at the moment

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,370
we're sort of at the point where we have

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,529
a numerical weather prediction model

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:29,140
generating weather and a simple

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,140
simulator generating fire spread outputs

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,930
you know the figure here you can see for

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
a particular fire I think this is around

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,730
creswicke where the developers of

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,070
Phoenix actually operate out of and you

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,390
know if we start the ignition point at T

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,310
equals zero which you can sort of see

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,070
that little blob in the center of the

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,720
Google Earth picture there if we let

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,579
that run for six hours you can see the

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,639
impact of simulation

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,309
physically spreads hbu kilometers and

00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,319
the right the red points are properties

00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:04,970
of fire called spotting so basically

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:07,309
when a fire burns it can throw fuel up

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,410
into the air and that fuels on fire that

00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:12,829
propagates down a couple of kilometers

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:15,199
perhaps it starts another fire so yeah

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,209
there's this process in there that the

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,459
rate of spread of a fly is actually full

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:23,389
of a bunch of complex things that are

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,619
actually very difficult to model so for

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,509
the bright white slide but I'm guessing

00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:30,230
it will wake you up the the underpinning

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,029
mathematics and things for the

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,449
simulators at the moment isn't actually

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:38,179
that complicated okay there's a few

00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:42,529
schools of thought around how to model

00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,879
the propagation of a fire front some of

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,499
the most successful ones are quite

00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,170
simple geometric models that basically

00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:50,269
say if you know what the type of fuel is

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,699
that you're surrounded by and the rate

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,759
at which it burns you can step in a

00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:57,739
particular direction and you sort of

00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,669
keep on updating that step over time and

00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:03,230
you get your simulation output the the

00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,660
west australian model uses cellular

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,459
automata which would be familiar to a

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,679
computer car that's a pretty popular

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,049
approach for modeling the rate of spread

00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,339
of diseases and things like that with

00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,019
that with fires they just have a

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,189
probability of ignition type thing where

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,779
they say okay you're going to propagate

00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:22,309
into the next cell if you've got enough

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:25,220
fuel to burn for example that's one

00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:27,470
component of a simulator there's lots of

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,149
components it's taken people decades

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,679
literally to come up with the

00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,040
underpinning models that plug into these

00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,509
things very much a case of standing on

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,019
the shoulders of giants you know that

00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:41,119
one of the most influential guys in this

00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:45,860
place was called MacArthur basically

00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:49,270
burnt a large chunk of Canberra to try

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,380
and come up with these geometric models

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:58,180
I won't say any more about MacArthur

00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:00,220
brilliant man so this talks about

00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:04,180
evaluating fire spread models what's an

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,520
evaluation so an evaluation is obviously

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,020
a process of picking up something

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,810
looking at it and making an assessment

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,820
in this in this case it's an assessment

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,910
of quality the Bureau of Meteorology

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,980
doesn't actually run simulators itself

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,410
they're run in the fire agencies and

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,360
we've been contracted to do this way so

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,560
we have to go out and talk to the fire

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,170
agencies and understand what they

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,850
defined quality is okay and there's a

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,130
lot of questions you ask when when you

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,540
do that one of the key ones is well

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,860
what's your forecast process how do you

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,720
actually use these simulators to make

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,380
decisions their decision support tools

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,780
okay so we've gone we've consulted with

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,280
with emergency services we sort of

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,420
understand the questions they ask of

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,740
simulators broadly and we're at this

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,630
point now where we're staying to ask

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,550
yourself questions like how do we

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:55,210
measure these things how do we define a

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,770
measure of quality the figure on the

00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,180
left here is just an example of a

00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,010
forecast process that happens in

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,750
Victoria where they have an automated

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,240
system that generates fly simulations

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,250
they have a co-located meteorologist

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,570
they have a fire behavior analyst and

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,980
they try and come up with predictions of

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:14,110
where the fire is going to go that

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,970
basically works with this so in the

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,530
context of the bureau and what we've

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,870
been sort of engaged to do it was an

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,330
evaluation well and in value an

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,680
evaluation for us is given our

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,990
understanding of quality and these

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,130
metrics that we should go and calculate

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,070
given that we know that we've got four

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,440
different simulators in Australia how

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,810
are we going to go and and evaluate all

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,780
these metrics and well it's it's a

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,880
computational task ok you you've got

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,160
four black boxes essentially which are

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,020
the simulators you've got a bunch of

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,730
fire events which are known the

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,280
significant events that have occurred in

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,780
the past and what we want to do is

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,840
figure out the sensitivity of the fire

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,640
simulators to its inputs and the quality

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,950
of the outputs that result from very no

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,320
sensitivities so the figure on the left

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,080
is just sort of like a explosion of

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,100
simulations type diagram that says if

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,380
you wanted to

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,740
and the sensitivity for example of this

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,410
Phoenix emulator to wind direction

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,300
change common approaches that you

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,400
perform sensitivity analysis you just

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,200
take the wind input and you very it

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,760
between a particular range that

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,590
generates a collection of outputs and

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,560
you figure out what happens when you

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,770
twist this knob at one end to the output

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,850
at the other end so with that output at

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,070
the other end you have to compare it

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,870
against something the gold standard at

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,270
the moment for us is line scan so it's

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,670
literally a plane flying over the top of

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,080
the running fire at a particular point

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,690
in time we get a snapshot of where the

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,120
fire progressed to its extent is defined

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,560
people literally draw polygons and say

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,410
this is what the shape of the fire was

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,210
at this time so we take the simulator we

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,070
run it to that point in time and we can

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,020
pair what the simulator generated to

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:57,250
what we observed and we calculate a

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,960
metric and there's a lot of metrics so

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,490
this is a programming conference so I'm

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,450
going to get to some of that eventually

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:07,360
say you know what supports an evaluation

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,030
okay I think there's three components

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,580
and underneath all of this is people

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,850
okay there's a lot of communication

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,550
understanding about what quality

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,990
actually means but I think the key

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,460
things and I'm really happy to be

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,930
involved in this session of talks

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,610
because I I'm going to talk about

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,710
reproducible science okay one one of the

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,290
key things is a reproducible environment

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,180
okay we're going to be doing these

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,860
experiments we're going to be sort of

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,840
kicking these fire simulators and

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,250
generating outputs and I want people to

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,990
be able to repeat those experiments

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,000
after the fact if there's new case

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,680
studies or something like that it should

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,310
be easy for people to increase the

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,770
sample size for analysis you know

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,480
obviously there's some software that's

00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,370
associated with this we have to make an

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,860
evaluation framework or a tool that

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:01,380
someone can kick to generate the outputs

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:04,150
generate the graphs generate the reports

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,880
sort of underpinning all of this is the

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:09,550
the tool the Jupiter notebook that we

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,460
use the sort of our framework for

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:16,880
reporting I guess I sort of use it as a

00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:19,850
workflow execution tool that's how

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,530
describe it to people at work it's an

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,160
interactive report but it can execute

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,449
code on clusters and things like that so

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,240
that's how I've sort of been selling it

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,460
the bureau the figure on the right shows

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,550
my sort of 10,000 foot view of what's

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,500
actually going on we have these Jupiter

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,470
notebooks which describe workflows they

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,000
are just experiments the experiments

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,320
have to do things with simulators

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,900
simulators of these horrible

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,370
heterogeneous blobs right there they are

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,620
implemented in different programming

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,880
languages I didn't mean to say they're

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,170
horrible they're not actually horrible

00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,860
they're beautiful they're fantastic

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:58,010
things but from a from a software point

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,390
of view they're just they're all colored

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,490
in different ways i use different pieces

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,290
of technology one might be a web

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,690
application one might be a dotnet

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,390
application the other could be some GPU

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,890
enabled binary thing that you don't have

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:15,770
much control over so we took Python we

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,020
wrapped that as the i guess the throw

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,300
rug over all of that that gave us a way

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,940
to execute the simulators and then we

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,740
use Jupiter as an environment to kick

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,420
that obviously because we have you no

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,710
need to execute these things many times

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,420
if we're performing a sensitivity

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,850
analysis we have to have some compute

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,520
power let sit underneath that just a

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,370
cluster of computers and that's you know

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,400
comprised of windows virtual servers and

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,080
Linux virtual servers you know you could

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,920
plug a supercomputer in there like NCI

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,810
for example as well and then we generate

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,900
lots of output because we generate lots

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:56,450
of simulations and simulations are just

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,550
stored at the moment on disk but they

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,250
could go to a database there's a lot of

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,020
simulation output as you could imagine

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,270
it's also a lot of curated weather data

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,360
that we have to collect so we can feed

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,830
the simulators and run them so now I'm

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,470
going to start getting to the technical

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,870
discussion and I'm going to expose

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,090
myself as not much of a docker expert

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,800
okay I thought the best way to do that

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,210
was to just go directly to the docker

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,120
website and pull some of the information

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,860
off there's a summary and then to say I

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,360
use it and it's fantastic and it's great

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,990
and I'll give you an example of how I'm

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,040
using it but you know ask myself the

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,530
question last night how do you

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,810
describe what doctors to people and I

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,370
googled it and I found a few times where

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,350
people were calling docker containers

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,660
lightweight virtual machines and then I

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,460
found a whole lot of hate around using

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,900
that terminology to describe docker so I

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:50,120
decided to go straight to the dr site

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:52,460
and pull out what they say I look at

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:56,020
dhaka in this process is just an enabler

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,550
right so doctor is a tool that I use to

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,220
completely pinned down my evaluation

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:06,190
environment so what does that mean that

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:10,520
means well I'll show you what it means

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,960
it means on github for example but I

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,960
probably should show you what I mean

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:21,920
escape out of this on github I can share

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,840
my environment with people so that if

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,130
they want to replicate the experiments

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,870
of performed they can start up my my

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,400
docker container which contains all the

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,760
libraries and all the things that I need

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,720
to run the simulators you know you know

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,250
in a very simple to use way now the

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,760
environment that we use is is a

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:47,690
composition of a bunch of containers I

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:50,810
guess in IT lingo there's this thing

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,730
called orchestration and we basically

00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,140
take a bunch of these docker containers

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,240
and we connect them up and they provide

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,000
services to us that's all we use for

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,590
that is doc you can pose I'd encourage

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,350
people to have a look at this if you

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,110
like but essentially all it is it's it's

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,700
a way of us describing exactly what the

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,120
services are that sort of underpinned

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,010
the evaluation framework and the pieces

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,010
of software that support it so the

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,230
libraries you know to get into more

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,170
detail I'm happy to do afterwards it's

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,850
basically simple use of a centos virtual

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,190
I don't wanna say virtual environment

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,500
centos based environment with the

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,370
Anaconda Python distribution that sets

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,370
up notebooks and things

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:43,560
so they ask is also in the title of this

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:45,690
talk I used ask once again I'm not an

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,360
absolute expert i use a subcomponent of

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,430
dusk so the thing that i make the most

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,120
use of is the distributed component of

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:57,090
dusk the way I sort of look at dusk is

00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,000
it's a tool that enables you to scale up

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,370
and scale out ok so if you've got some

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,250
computation that is particularly

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,790
amenable to you know shifting on to some

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,110
classroom and simulators are because

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:13,410
simulations are independent of each

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:17,190
other so i used ask for the simple task

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,600
of task farming basically i get each of

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,340
the simulators wrap them in a little

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,720
function throw them off to the cluster

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,000
the cluster goes and calculates that

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,250
independent thing sore as a result and i

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,680
can pull it back I've got a I've got a

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:32,160
notebook which is an example of that so

00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:38,130
I'll just escaped out of this and give

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:40,500
you a quick demo of what what docker is

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,320
actually being used for and into how

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,570
we're using dusk so I described asker's

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,830
and and the combination of dusk and

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,800
Jupiter notebooks is a web-based

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,200
distribution distributed execution

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,000
environment which sits pretty well with

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,620
people because a lot of these things

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,480
seem really complicated if you go to a

00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,310
supercomputer and if you've got to learn

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,770
how to use a job scheduler and all of

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,270
that that's a bit daunting whereas if

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,310
you just opened up a webpage and click

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,160
to play a few times that's not that

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,990
daunting so the technology that sort of

00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,870
underpins this you know these dhaka

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,120
containers we've got a docker container

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,770
for a notebook server we've got a docker

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,500
container for a scheduler which is the

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,910
thing that controls all the dust jobs

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,100
we've got a bunch of distributed workers

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,660
they go and talk to these simulator

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,340
containers because simulators are these

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,690
heterogeneous things they'll have

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,780
different environments that they need to

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,100
set up and then we've got some document

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,800
a nurs so all this stuff is all

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,450
orchestrated occure compose it all glues

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,130
together you can start and stop it you

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:44,250
can run it on windows around on a Mac

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:46,200
running in Linux so just a typical

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,460
example of what I'm doing without going

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,330
into the detail of the

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,159
simulator execution is a pretty

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,620
straightforward workflow of loadings and

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,270
data cleaning it analyzing it and

00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:02,700
storing the result okay and so this desk

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,470
sort of delayed decorator that the

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,870
provided a delayed function allows you

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,440
to create a graph that you can basically

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:15,919
apply to the composition of functions

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:18,270
and then execute so it's quite simple

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,770
okay this isn't particularly inspiring

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:23,220
in terms of what we're doing here we're

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,779
just sleeping a bunch okay but the idea

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,909
is you define a couple of functions and

00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,220
you chain them together and then you use

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,710
this thing called delayed to turn that

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,690
chain of functions into a graph which

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,260
then gets sent out to your cluster and

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:45,960
calculated okay it's as simple as that

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:48,270
to give you an example if we take that

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,190
chained workflow right which consists of

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,950
five hundred of these load clean

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,409
analyzed store sort of sleepy functions

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,230
I guess and we throw them off to this

00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:59,850
thing called an executor so in the

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,440
context of an executor that's something

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:06,360
like a similar interface to the

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,570
multiprocessing concurrent futures type

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,210
in a face that exists in Python right

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,649
you can throw these functions along and

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,169
it and you get the single to future

00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:18,450
future basically says I promise you that

00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:20,610
I'll go and calculate this function and

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,520
it it does that using this distributed

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,140
sort of machinery distributed has this

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,580
really nice interface it allows you to

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,159
look at the progress of your work in

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,399
notebooks if you go the distributed

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:36,330
website you'll see some of this stuff if

00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:37,980
we run it something should pop up you

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,929
get these sort of progress bars give you

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,350
an idea of what's shuffling its way

00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:45,380
through the queue behind all that

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:48,149
there's actually also a really nice

00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,159
interface based on this bouquet plotting

00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:55,740
library that that you can use to see

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:57,059
what's happening you know mileage varies

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,080
with this a little bit depending on how

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,080
big your workflow is

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,970
often I'm confronted with questions like

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,100
why I use open source one of the really

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,620
good examples is i was using task to do

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,200
simulator execution ran into a brick

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,940
wall basically one of the simulators is

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,160
a windows simulator and i couldn't set

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:23,520
up task workers so i contacted the

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,520
author and I said cross-platform workers

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,290
don't work I can't connect and I got

00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,780
this horrible exception I don't know

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:36,570
what to do with it within about five

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:39,630
minutes it was fixed so you know at the

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,580
time I was the lone lone wolf developer

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,590
I guess pulling together all of this

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,720
framework all of a sudden it felt like I

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,680
had a team and it was and it was great

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,360
so I've used this as an example to my

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,730
managers to say well hey you know

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,320
there's some real benefits to using open

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,110
source software and having access to

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,340
this environment in real terms to them

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,880
it just means they got some work done

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,950
for free and they love it you know for

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,190
me I like the idea of being involved in

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:12,150
the community and that's really great so

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:15,330
what's some sleep back there was a

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,740
comparison of dust to spark you know

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,930
someone asked a question about this the

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,330
other day I pulled it straight off the

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,690
website people can read the slides if

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:27,000
they want I just look at dusk in

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,610
comparison to spark is a much much much

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,270
simpler framework to use you can peep

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,860
installed ask okay you know and you can

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,780
peep install distributed and you can

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,140
just set it up in like a heartbeat takes

00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,090
no time at all my experience with spark

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,800
basically boils down to a word counting

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,440
exercise that I played with ages ago and

00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,640
that's it so I'm not going to say

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,490
anymore about spark we used Jupiter

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,230
notebooks we use them to generate

00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,020
reports we use those reports and

00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,260
presentation material that sort of comes

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,900
out of the documents at conferences and

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:09,420
things like that it's the Swiss Army

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,860
knife for us you know essentially in

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,420
terms of the simulator execution

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,600
environment it's sort of a front end to

00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,090
distribute code

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,490
to distributed code so it's how we kick

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:22,150
the simulator executions off it's how we

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,419
make sure they're running we've actually

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,630
paid a person to convert Jupiter

00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,650
notebooks into Word documents

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,350
automatically we have a tool to do that

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,679
by the way which is fantastic for us

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:38,220
because we write lots of Word documents

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,570
we do a lot of methods development I'll

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:46,210
escape out of this and just give you an

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:49,000
idea of of what happens you know we do

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,490
things like visualize data in notebooks

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,030
we look at fire scars we mess around

00:28:51,490 --> 00:29:00,159
with and this is all interactive may or

00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:01,750
may not zoom in well that soon didn't

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,390
completely the wrong direction but

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,370
anyway the point is we do a lot of of

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,220
work in notebooks to look at the outputs

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:12,039
and sort of the path that we have is we

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,780
do a lot of sort of bespoke analysis

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,270
work that eventually becomes do it

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,950
functions in modules that then reduce

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,840
the amount of content that we have in

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,480
the notebooks which is probably not a

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,940
bad way of going it also has to go

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,549
through in our testing path as well so

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,020
that notebooks I sort of think sometimes

00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,820
I like the Wild West like you can

00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,409
basically open them up and put anything

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,380
in there and it's fantastic and you get

00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:36,940
some result and I think that disconnects

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,640
people from good software development

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,330
practices and yeah I'm encouraging

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:51,130
people not to do that my team so if we

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:53,650
go back pretty close to finishing no I

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,200
know the next few talks about

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,659
reproducibility and science and all of

00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,730
that and I just want to say a few things

00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,080
about where we're going next with the

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:06,370
evaluation project in terms of

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,539
technology right I really strongly feel

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,929
we're following the recipe for

00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:13,990
reproducibility yeah I want someone in a

00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,760
year or two years after I'm like you

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,440
know working on something else or

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,970
thinking about something different to be

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,870
able to pick up my project just push

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,890
play and regenerate the results okay

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,290
there's a few bits of technology that

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,780
support that

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,210
one piece of technology is github for

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,640
example having the code out there and

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,240
open and you know interrogator ball by

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,310
external people is a good thing it's

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,370
never a bad thing I'm going to staff I

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:43,110
promise the other thing that we have to

00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:44,670
think about using is reproducible

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,830
environment making that available to

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,800
people i use docker hub it's a free

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,080
service it's really good another service

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,780
that we make use of mostly because it's

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,070
free and fantastic is Circle C I so you

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,260
know any of the unit tests that we've

00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,670
written for the evaluation software gets

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,770
funneled through circle see how it's all

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,940
wrapped into our build process and

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,940
