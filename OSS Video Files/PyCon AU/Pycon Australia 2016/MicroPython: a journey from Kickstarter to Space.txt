MicroPython is a lean and efficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a
reduced standard library, and brings the awesomeness of Python to computing
devices with few resources, such as microcontrollers.  In this talk I will
detail my journey in building MicroPython and the various projects that it
has been used in and the people who are using it.  I will talk about running
a successful Kickstarter campaign (actually two of them!), circuit board
manufacturing, working with the European Space Agency, working with the BBC
on the micro:bit project, and the challenges of managing and funding
open-source software.  There will also be some live demos!
