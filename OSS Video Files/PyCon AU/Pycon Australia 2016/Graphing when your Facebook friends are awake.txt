Look I’m not really sure why but I think I made a thing that makes graphs of when people are online on Facebook. It sounds kinda creepy and uh it is. We'll talk about the struggle of finding a good graphing library, so come along and roleplay as  the NSA. ˙ ͜ʟ˙

hi everyone finally we have Alex hope

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,700
alex is a kid with a laptop and a pocket

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:15,120
full of memes currently he's a security

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,890
something at Atlassian which is a little

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,580
bit like being an adult but with more

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,130
ice cream

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,590
he makes dumb novelty websites as a

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,930
substitute for getting out more please

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:32,790
welcome Alex and his talk graphing when

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:35,219
your Facebook friends are awake hi

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,390
everyone I read that buyer very late at

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,550
night and I didn't know they were gonna

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:48,149
read it out huh it's too late now

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:50,340
also not clicking that's fine so um hi

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,980
I'm Alex I work on the security team at

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,730
Atlassian and somebody let me know I can

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,219
do it it's fine

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,250
yeah and somebody let me do a PyCon talk

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,390
so here I am so here's a picture of me

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,769
and my pal

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,970
bears this is an act you might be able

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,860
to tell this isn't actually a real

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,720
picture of me and Obama my arms not that

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,790
big but I tried my best

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,310
recently somebody wrote a news article

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,530
about me and they referred to me as a

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,530
hacker who goes by the name Alex

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,190
so that's my hacker handle now and

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,570
there's nothing I can do about it but

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,710
probably like a double bluff no one

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,490
would ever expect that I would actually

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:40,869
make my hacker name a real name so

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,520
gotcha come on you can do it okay oh

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,350
yeah so as part of this talk if you have

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,450
any like questions or if you have any

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,640
like if you think I'm wrong or if you

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,690
have any stick heckles or anything or if

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,440
you just want to say something just do

00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,149
it just yell at me

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,920
I have no power over you I'm just a kid

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,119
with a microphone so please do it and

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,170
there will be a dedicated heckle break

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,740
later in the talk if you want to wait

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,640
for that but otherwise just go for it

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,590
okay so let me tell you about a thing

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,330
happened to me recently one day I was on

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,920
Facebook calm

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,030
if you don't know Facebook it's a

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,709
website where you can keep up to date

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,160
with the means that your friends are

00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:14,280
commenting on and I was didn't worry

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,070
about those backups that'll be fine and

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,900
I was looking at the sidebar because

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,510
it's a chat feature on facebook.com and

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,800
has this sidebar look at it and it's got

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,180
a whole bunch of people's names it's

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,980
also got these little green dots next to

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,350
them and it's got a little time a little

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,670
18 minutes next to someone else and I

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,519
was wondering well what's the deal with

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,769
these green dots these green dots what's

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,470
the deal with them and so I wanted to

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,340
know I wanted to know what the site was

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,510
doing I wanted to know what Facebook

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,670
talk on was doing like under the hood

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,670
wanted to be a mad hacker like this guy

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,190
this guy's walking around in this guy's

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,860
walking around in a flooding Java so you

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,730
know who's that guy

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,860
anyway turns out it's really easy to be

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,019
hacker I found this really easy two-step

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,650
process step one is to right-click in

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:06,800
your browser

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:08,750
step two is this guy right here yeah

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,060
right click inspect element it's good

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,380
stuff if you listen really closely you

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,319
can actually hear the air horns in the

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,610
distance when you press that button

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,470
andressa once you do that you get this

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,489
stuff at the bottom which I assume is

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,310
the source code to facebook.com/

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,319
probably and you can see what's going on

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,579
on the side and so you know you're

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,630
hacking because once you go into the

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,540
inspect element you get this message

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,040
from Facebook which says stop if you're

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,079
in here this is the JavaScript console

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,880
and anyone can run any code they want so

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,230
if someone told you hey you can be a mad

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,700
hacker by right-clicking and going here

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,650
then copy pasting this code that's

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,269
anything on your cookies don't do it so

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,700
obviously some people have had some

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,260
problems where the friend tells them hey

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,220
I think you should go to Facebook I

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,720
think you should right click inspect

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,299
element and just copy and paste this

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,700
JavaScript code that I wrote it so now

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,030
Facebook has a big red big red stuff

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,840
that says don't do it anyway sorry back

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,250
to hacking so here we are looking at the

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,569
network tab so you can see all the

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,980
network requests of all the different

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,410
stuff that Facebook is definitely trying

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,579
to load as it loads facebook.com and I

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,660
don't know how I found it I was just

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:10,040
kind of clicking through these randomly

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,489
instead of going to a party or something

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,470
and I found this thing this so

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,359
facebook.com slash pull and then a bunch

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,070
of stuff in there and I clicked on it I

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,889
was like what's in here what what what's

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,680
this what does this URL return and I got

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,210
this stuff this random JSON and it was

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,740
really fun to like reverse-engineer and

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,330
try and figure out what it does and so I

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,220
guess what you guys get to do it what is

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,950
this so I want to tell me what is what

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,900
does this thing mean yes the type of the

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,139
message nice see it's easy what's this

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,229
thing easy sequence number and what's

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:45,680
this thing it's a user ID who's user ID

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:48,550
is it yes my is it that's my user ID if

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,550
you want to add me on Facebook

00:04:50,720 --> 00:05:02,970
just go for it yeah it's my user ID and

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:03,870
what's this yes

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,640
so some people are saying it's a

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,550
timestamp some people are saying it's

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,330
someone else if you didn't have a lot of

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,830
friends in high school you might

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,290
recognize that as a UNIX timestamp

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,720
because it starts with one four and then

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,980
that's kind of the time but actually

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,030
this is one of my friends being a

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,380
massive troll I didn't choose this

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,990
example anything it just happened and

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,460
this friend's user ID looks a lot like a

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,660
UNIX timestamp the first two digits all

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,650
right it's got the right number of

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,940
digits but no this is actually my

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:36,630
friends user ID gotcha and and this one

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,670
this la thing what's this yeah what it's

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,110
a time but yeah that's right it's the

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,240
last active time so it's the last time

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,430
they were on Facebook services or

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,660
Facebook Messenger or something last

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:54,150
active time nice and what's this stuff

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:55,770
yeah I know this is if you know that's

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,720
great maybe you should tell me I still

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,890
don't know if you don't maybe you can

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,110
tell me but whatever we're not gonna use

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,250
it I also found this other bit of JSON

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,600
or somewhere else I don't remember where

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,520
and I'm just going to tell you what this

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,800
is easy mode here's some ones here's

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,950
your friends user ID and it will tell

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,470
you about that friend what their status

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,200
is whether they're online offline online

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,630
idle or active and on which platform

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,250
they are so there's like facebook.com

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,419
there's messenger app there's actual

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,610
Facebook app which is separate to the

00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,620
messenger app and there's other I don't

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,240
know what other does and it's also this

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,040
overarching one called status which like

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,630
that decides whether you get a green dot

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,890
or not the status is available you get a

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,510
green dot if it's not thing you don't

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,650
get a green dot and it like come by and

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,730
so the other ones somehow I don't know

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,140
exactly yeah but it's too late now we've

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,940
already found out that stuff and I was

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,320
like well that's interesting but there's

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,419
an API there you can just get that I

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,100
wonder if maybe I should just what if

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,660
that like you guys remember these green

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,010
dots what if what if there's somebody

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,410
who was like always watching the green

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,100
does what if there was someone what if

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,750
they're someone with a pen and paper

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,500
like looking at the green dots and like

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:03,560
writing down what's happening well so I

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,660
wrote this code to you know do that too

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,139
what's happening with that API just

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,260
forever just be running all the time and

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:14,570
here is um some some little some data

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,340
that I have and it's got the time and

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,979
then it's got just the raw JSON so it's

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,120
got what they were whether the person

00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,979
with online offline invisible and all

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,300
the different platforms and like you

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,949
might notice that I'm doing a head - 10

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,970
there so it's only ten lands I got a lot

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:30,290
of these files if if you have you have a

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,760
lot of Facebook friends oh you do if

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,850
you're a put your Facebook ID and you

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,660
talk like I do and like there's a lot of

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,639
these log files and they're just

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,500
constantly downloading and I was like

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,430
this is great now it can be really

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,880
creepy I don't really want to do that

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,240
but I guess it's possible so I needed a

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,889
way to put this oh no sorry don't let me

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,210
get head of myself it's time for the

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,010
heckle break anyone got any anyone

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,010
anyone have anything to say anyone oh

00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,710
yes if somebody who was organized

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:07,820
wouldn't know the answer to that but

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:09,470
we'll find out yeah only your friends

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:16,700
can see this about you as far as I know

00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:18,050
maybe as far as I know yeah I have no

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,070
idea and if someone could tell me that

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,450
would be great I tried to figure it out

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,599
sometimes you're invisible sometimes the

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,020
offline I have no idea okay fine heckle

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,260
breaks over

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,090
you had your chance anyway so here's all

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,410
the data I have and I need to make a

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,880
blog post about this so I can impress

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,560
everyone I can use so need to make a

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,659
graph out of it and I was like okay

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,289
let's go I just want to have the data

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,120
turn into a graph this should be easy

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,740
um so okay I just been doing my honors

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,240
thesis recently so it's like okay

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,470
matplotlib it's how you make graphs

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,450
let's make a graph let's go

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,860
okay math awesome calm got a Google map

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,270
up there how do I get this ok have to

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,310
pimp install it all right let's go back

00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,010
this is a site okay and then you get

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,779
this this is elegant code right here and

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,339
so you got an import the thing and you

00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,510
alias leap it something else cuz you're

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,300
a data scientist you do have time to

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,440
type the whole thing and then then you

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,640
make this figure object which you're

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,950
gonna need but then you make the access

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,330
object and you put 1 1 1 in there that's

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,640
binary 4 7 that means it's really lucky

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,440
I think

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,090
and then you got to plot the data and

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,060
the little ro thing there's a little

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,740
mini language that means red circles and

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,940
the dash means something else I don't

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,950
know what it is so you get this like

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,330
crazy text-based language for what shape

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,280
you want you have to be and then

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,080
obviously you got a okay that's still

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,190
the same thing organized slides okay and

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,630
then obviously you gotta set your major

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,250
formatting function because you want the

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,110
x-axis to be the right units otherwise

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,280
no one will look at your graphs and no

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,900
one will read your blog post and then

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,370
you have this one massive line of code

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,540
which is like hey don't forget all these

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,800
magic numbers that you need otherwise

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,670
it's not going to be a graph and they

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,990
got it and then here we go we we did all

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,830
that we did all this code and we're

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,880
gonna get something like this that's not

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,380
the exact code that comes from that

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,210
graph this is just some weather that was

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,150
all example code from a pot live.com so

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,380
whoo and so now you get this graph I

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,730
can't go to heck and use with this I

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,320
can't put this in a blog post no one's

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:04,750
not gonna happen so okay nope moving on

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,600
so I was like I was googling like what

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,520
is better than Matt but Lib please help

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,810
and this library is called pocket I

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,180
think that's how you pronounce it and

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,190
here we go it's got a website it's got

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,720
some CSS okay it's got some pictures of

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,510
graphs maybe this will make the graphs

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,760
for me it brands itself as a map for

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,790
labor killer so all right the stakes are

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,440
low let's go and so this is what you get

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,400
the API is exactly the same as my pot

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,870
Lube so you don't have to change your

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,280
code that's that's kind of one cool

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,410
thing and this doesn't generate a

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,740
picture this generates HTML and

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,780
JavaScript out of your data and I wanted

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,580
the graph to be interactive and so this

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,080
thing gives you this this tool panel

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,550
thing and you can like customize which

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,970
tools you went up there with even more

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,830
code and you thing is like you can click

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,180
the move tool then you can move then you

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,560
can click the zoom tool and then you can

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,480
scroll we can't advise at the same time

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,890
and luckily that's like two different

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
zooms it's like the resume where you

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,820
draw a box and there's the thing where

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,280
you scroll and it was very stressful to

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,710
use and so I didn't want to put that on

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,240
anybody and also it's not that pretty

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,630
I mean it's okay it's too science he

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,020
needs to be something you know web 9.0

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:14,790
so no and then somebody said I think it

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,790
was Einstein that you don't

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,320
now that you don't generate graph

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,910
service out anymore the cool new trendy

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,510
way if they don't take a photo of that

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,510
oh boy huh

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,220
yeah the cool new trendy way is that

00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,630
your server generates the data and you

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,430
just send the data to like the browser

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,810
and then the browser just has the data

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,120
and can generate the graph over once

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,750
that's the new spicy way and so okay

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,930
somebody said I should use env d3.js Jas

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,490
is in green and so here we go it's not

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,860
got another website it's got bootstrap

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,690
themes all right and I'm ready to go in

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,089
and get this new feature of graphing and

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,320
so I was wondering if this what I want

00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,610
is this a graphical happy for me this is

00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,810
the third one and I'd like to really

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,520
write the blog post and not find more

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,230
graphing libraries but okay so it's a

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,660
graphing library and it ends with da je

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,970
s and it depends on another thing that

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:14,750
ends in je s so that's that's the good

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:15,589
stuff yeah so everyone's got to be like

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,180
what do you mean you weren't already

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,529
using the thing it depends on obviously

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,399
everyone's using that C might as well

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,260
use this thing because we're all

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,149
operating stuff I put this on Hacker

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,560
News and somebody like somebody in the

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,029
comments was like no but really how

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,770
you're not using the new how are you not

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:29,060
using this weird JavaScript library and

00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,370
if one there's this long discussion

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,250
about the how important it was that

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,110
everyone uses d3.js which NB d3 depends

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,070
on and I think some of them after that

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,709
they read the blog post or something

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:46,010
um yeah west pad that's very different

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,390
talk anyway well after all that after

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,980
three graphing lobbies we got this and

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,260
not even that good like it's pretty good

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,279
but like I wish it was I wish I didn't

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,290
have to do anything which were just

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,660
magically pretty oh well

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,459
and so remember this is what I have at

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,050
this data and I want it to be beautiful

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,810
I want people and I can use down fated

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,120
and so what you do is you take your data

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,160
and turn it to a CSV so this CSV is like

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,899
the time and then for each status like

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,490
like a zero is offline and three is

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,740
online so I turn it all into this form

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,300
and then all I have to do is just put it

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,220
into the front end right then it's easy

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,600
you just put this data into you into

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,250
like your HTML page and then the

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,130
JavaScript will turn it into a graph so

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,029
you get this stuff to turn into a graph

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,350
you get this and it's really easy to

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:25,809
follow what's going on because you just

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,679
put code

00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,879
and so actually this didn't solve the

00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,259
problem at all right there's just like

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,399
outsource the problem to the front end

00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,759
now the front has to do the spaghetti

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,809
code thing so I don't know what I

00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:38,329
learned is it's hard to make grass no

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,920
matter what you do maybe maybe I'm too

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:41,179
naive for hoping there to be like some

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,529
easy way to make grass maybe grass

00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,240
should be Duda or something instead of

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,009
code I know if any of you write a

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
graphing library please tell me what I

00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,869
should be doing but no I de struggled my

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,059
way there and made mediocre graphs oh

00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:55,369
well time to look at some graphs so now

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,720
I've got a couple of graphs from people

00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:58,369
who have said I can use their graph of

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
their face books in my slides and so

00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,529
we're just gonna have a browse with them

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,189
and you know stalk them whatever

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,720
casually ok so here's somebody I don't

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,389
remember who this is and let me explain

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,160
what's going on in this graph so on the

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,540
bottom firstly we're zooming into a

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,339
certain section of the graph and the

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,279
bottom axis is time this is from like

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:19,459
9:01 a.m. to 9:41 a.m. that's what this

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,050
graph is and up here we have how on line

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,220
they are this was kind of a hard thing

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,619
to visualize and this is what I came up

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,939
with I hope it's okay so like the very

00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:27,290
bottom is off line in the very top is

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,800
active but there's like idle and it's

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,269
invisible

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,199
sometimes you invisible sometimes you

00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,029
off line I don't really know how it

00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,249
works and that each of the colored lines

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,809
is a different like platform so there's

00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,360
like one the blue one is like status

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,619
which is the main one and then the

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,699
orange one is like facebook messenger

00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,660
the app and there's a different one and

00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,459
so on and if different lands for

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,360
everyone and so this is not that

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,249
interesting you can see that use

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,799
Facebook from like twenty past nine

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,939
until nine thirty five issue and they

00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,329
were kind of on and off on a few things

00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:56,209
all right but because hello

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:59,059
click okay but you can zoom out on this

00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,679
and see their bigger picture and so now

00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:02,449
you can say okay here's um here's

00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,490
somebody's graph and you can see that

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,319
they're on line until like the on line

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,579
on and off in a day and then suddenly at

00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,549
about midnight they stop being offline

00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:11,929
they stop being online and I mean there

00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,339
could be any reason for why their stuff

00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,660
to being online at midnight that's

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:18,379
probably because I went to sleep on this

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,610
day right at this time approximately and

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,879
then they suddenly become online again

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,410
at about nine o'clock and so like I mean

00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,089
it's only a Facebook it doesn't actually

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,499
tell you what they're doing but like if

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,790
you're the kind of person who is like

00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,110
looks at Facebook right before they

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,910
sleep and looks at Facebook shortly

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,679
after they wake up then it really

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,149
conveniently just makes this pattern of

00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,220
when you're awake when you're asleep

00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:40,269
even though you didn't mean to like

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,930
hours to Facebook II I kind of did a

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,529
special shout-out to Facebook for

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,529
sponsoring this event

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,069
and so he's a he's the little here's the

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,389
idea you can kind of put lines and guess

00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,769
that like I mean this is probably not

00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:57,079
exactly when they lost consciousness but

00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:58,399
it's probably close to when this person

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,970
with a sleep it's really creepy you're

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,910
saying that stuff out loud but I guess

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,990
this is my talk now so anyway but you

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,360
can just do them out even more if you

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,589
want and here is somebody else's graph

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,759
this is not zooming out in the same

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,459
graph it's cheating don't tell anyone

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,560
and so here is me like lazily putting

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:17,480
these awake asleep lines on where the

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,379
where the activity stops right and so

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,579
you can see people kind of using

00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,860
Facebook in the day and they're stopping

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,629
and then going back on and so because

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,339
you can see the width of the asleep

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,720
thing change right like the first one is

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,970
kind of short the second one's kind of

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,470
longer you can see that the person has

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,389
like slept for less time than the first

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,399
one and the second one or was on

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,379
Facebook so it was off Facebook for less

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,000
time so in the first one it looks like

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,939
they're asleep from 4:00 a.m. until 8:30

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,809
a.m. and that's what why can I tell that

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:45,800
about people who are my Facebook friends

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:49,879
anyway I'll put this code on github like

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,470
a responsible person would do and so I

00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,750
had a whole bunch of people making

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,420
issues there's 17 issues okay good

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,250
this is a recent screenshot so and I get

00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,600
all these people being like people like

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,819
on github issues or people in real life

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,410
being like hey yeah I'm trying to stalk

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,640
my ex on Facebook but I can't figure out

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,799
how to put the thing in there maybe you

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,010
could help me and I'm like maybe you

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,010
should

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,209
yeah the instructions they're like I

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,620
kind of left out like one of the

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,670
important parts like how to get your

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,949
Facebook cookie what you need to put

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,510
there and a lot of people having a lot

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,740
of stress with that and they were like

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,730
hey I'm just gonna stalk my friends on

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,959
Facebook guys wondering if you could

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,580
provide Python to support and I'm like

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,050
no anyways so you don't have to just

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,070
make graphs and there's you can make

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,300
yeah obviously you have one graph for

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,640
everyone it's not just one graph you

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,740
could also like look for like for a

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,700
certain person like like guess how long

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,140
they've been asleep each night and then

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,270
like find a night where they sleep more

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,920
or less and be like that's weird or I

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,590
haven't haven't done this but I think

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,970
it'd be fun you just make a like make a

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,380
thing to scrape this over all of your

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,090
friends and then like it emails you

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,230
every morning or like every day like 9

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,520
o'clock be like hey these people in this

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,450
lecture like 5 hours last night and then

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,920
you see them in real life and you're

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:04,940
like oh you look sleepy don't actually

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,940
do that by the way that's really creepy

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,140
you people anyway that's so why does it

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,490
why can't I do this like what why can't

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,020
anyone do this why did this happen and

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,150
it's because there's this secret

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,650
undocumented Facebook API so like the

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,300
flesh pull thing that's the global

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,170
endpoint that although Facebook on me

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,150
this to load all they're like

00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,470
asynchronous stuff but on what's the

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,720
sides have these like you know they have

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,580
like a web api that their front end uses

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,440
but it's not like an official API or

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,150
anything like it's just it's there for

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,370
it's there for like internal years but

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,350
it's externally exposed and those api's

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,429
tend to go under less scrutiny because

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,040
they're not official right they kind of

00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:40,500
just sneakily they're and so if you're a

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,610
developer you should like consider that

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,929
someone's gonna find your secret

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,070
undocumented API and they're gonna

00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,330
figure out what it does whether you

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,420
document it or no that doesn't mean

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,770
don't document your API is but and also

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,880
if your hacker and you want to find some

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,830
stuff maybe you should like look around

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,050
for these secret api's maybe you'll be

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,100
the first one to find it you're happy

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,110
wondering can I stop you from doing this

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,790
to me good question the best way to do

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,970
it is to not add me on Facebook but too

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,050
late for some of you you can also I

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,760
found out recently I thought there was

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,550
no way to stop this I found out recently

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,530
that you can somewhere hidden away in

00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,690
the settings i think it's facebook.com/

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,179
but not the messenger app or something

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,130
one of the things is you can turn off

00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,870
chat I think it's called and it turns

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,310
your chat into like email so like you

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,350
can't see when anyone's online and they

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,370
can't see when you're online and so you

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,450
just say my student

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,830
and I think you don't have the same

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,870
messages for EJ either it like takes

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,010
away their presence functionality so

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,360
that will keep that won't make it so

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,860
people can do this to you but also you

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,860
can't see when they're online so it's

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,630
like a trade-off also as a coincidence

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm always online because my thing is

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:43,800
always running collecting stuff so

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,140
that's one way you could do it I don't

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,520
recommend it if you like this talk you

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:52,730
might like this site you might find that

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,430
it has some material relatable to you

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,140
and this talk this talk has been mostly

00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,100
about like you know internet stuff and

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,050
seem it you might be wondering like

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,240
where the Python content wasn't this for

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,510
me if I'm a path in person thank you

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,510
very much

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:23,219
anybody have questions so I think like

00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:26,039
many people I mainly just ignore privacy

00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:28,259
kind of 360 days a week and then like

00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,089
the five-day 360 days a week and they're

00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,249
like five days a year I just kind of

00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:33,779
have existential panic because I'm kind

00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:36,389
of fully aware this kind of stuff is

00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:38,879
possible and it just like mostly doesn't

00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:40,679
happen very much and like mostly doesn't

00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:43,190
affect people but I'm sure it affects

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,070
some people and like what should I think

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:50,639
to written what should you what should

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:53,639
you think what should you think Wow too

00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:55,440
real with the five days a year thing so

00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:57,509
I mean it's up to you like it's kind of

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,950
like so when you put stuff on the

00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:59,759
internet like on like your Facebook

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,830
profile and stuff

00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,629
most people think like oh my friends can

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,519
see it but actually it's like well

00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,279
everyone who works at the company that

00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,359
you're putting it on can see it and

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,399
sometimes there sometimes people don't

00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,809
think about the fact that some things

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:14,580
are public like Instagram it's by

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:16,830
default public and with all these photos

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,200
all over the place and it really depends

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,279
on now was the one way to think about it

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,379
is it depends on how interesting you are

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,820
right it depends on whether someone's

00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:26,309
going to go to the effort to stalk you

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,960
to find out something about you if

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:29,700
you're just a regular low profile person

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,969
not like a distinguished icon speaker

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,200
then their people from way that's

00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:35,429
probably like there's a lot of people

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,499
out there to stalk the people probably

00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,789
on average when she's you but if you

00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:40,919
like somebody really famous like

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,429
somebody who's a big deal like PyCon

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,899
speaker then then maybe you're gonna

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,919
have that one really creepy fan who's

00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,059
gonna do this to you and they're gonna

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,869
like I don't know stalk you and bad

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,320
things are gonna happen to you in real

00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:51,749
life

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,249
so I guess it's your risk to take but it

00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,580
depends on how likely you think someone

00:21:53,249 --> 00:22:02,909
is to do this to you thank you for a

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:05,909
very entertaining tour the privacy

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:09,089
settings per friendship you can set

00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,320
friends as acquaintances and you can

00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:12,899
follow them and other things have you

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,469
found any ways to essentially say these

00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:19,440
people cannot see but others can not on

00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:21,929
chat and not on the facebook chat not on

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,549
the messenger part like the the online

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,020
offline things for a facebook messenger

00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:26,280
that's just everybody who

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,300
you're friends with can see you and I

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,890
don't know the way to change it maybe

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,300
you can there's a lot of settings I have

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,130
known people who can make who have made

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,420
Facebook lists you can make like lists

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,220
of Facebook friends like custom lists

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,410
yourself and make lists called soft

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,280
delete which is like you can't see me

00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,140
and I can't say you but we're

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:51,030
technically still friends have you

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:56,220
explored locations can you mind that

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:58,080
through this if you want to stock your

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,550
friends for location what's the best way

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,120
you found oh yeah yeah my friend wants

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,320
to stalk my friends yeah okay so the

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,790
answer is you used to you used to be

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,840
able to do that on Facebook Messenger I

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,460
don't know if you remember that you used

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,590
to like on Facebook Messenger if you're

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,580
using the mobile app people you get a

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,620
message from someone and I would say

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,330
sent from this suburb they don't

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,650
remember that yeah people nodding and

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,710
that's because by default

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,970
facebook Messenger used to send your

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,170
location with every message that you

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,280
send and that was like full GPS

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,020
coordinates as well not just like a

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,710
general thing I don't know why that one

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,060
city foe but it was and then somebody

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,140
made a Chrome extension called marauders

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,060
map you guys might have heard of it

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,040
which goes and mine's your facebook

00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,540
Messenger history and makes like I put

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,500
like a Google map and puts shows you

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,120
where your friends were and where they

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,560
move to and stuff so you can see like

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,210
exactly where they were like where they

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,530
live and everything and then Facebook

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,060
chains are setting to be not the default

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,980
but I think you can still turn it on if

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,270
you want badan or maybe there's some

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,570
secret API out there that has that I

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,570
don't know

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:10,159
I I'm a security engineer at Facebook hi

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,150
nice talk by the way

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,559
basically I'm not nothing here it's

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,510
likely a security breach so you were

00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,919
using our cookies to get that for your

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,440
friends so they are actually exposing

00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,029
information so just the answering and

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,650
request actually we removed the

00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:24,510
coordinates from the messenger faith so

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,789
you can't even turn into them anymore so

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:34,200
so you can't anymore people's location

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:35,250
anymore oh just say hi maybe I'll come

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,490
and talk to you after this or maybe I

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,490
went away

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,409
hey great talk

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:47,880
I was wondering as a consequence of this

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:55,740
you have more or less friends I'm not

00:24:47,880 --> 00:25:05,010
like about so I haven't checked anyone

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:07,590
else do I have more or less friends have

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:10,140
you played with dynamically changing

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:13,140
your security settings so you can switch

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,299
on the relevant settings to retrieve

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,919
data about your friends and then switch

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:20,970
it off again straight away so that they

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,529
can't see you I think the way it works

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,980
maybe if someone for Facebook could tell

00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:26,680
you

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,050
if that you can only see other people

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,850
while while you are in line at the same

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,050
time so if you wanted to record everyone

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,970
all the time you have to be online all

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,710
the time so I don't know but maybe that

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:41,890
maybe that's not true I don't know maybe

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:50,440
you should ask um an expert anyone else

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:51,730
Nichols so you say you can see when if

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,250
you're online and you're running your

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,950
script you appear permanently online you

00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:00,600
could use your script to see if there's

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,890
anyone else of your friends stalking you

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,080
because they don't make it always online

00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,640
and never asleep yeah maybe I'm not sure

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,260
I think I'm not always online but

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,370
because I bet I get random messages from

00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,260
people at 4:00 in the morning being like

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,730
why are you online and I'm not write it

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,380
after the script but I don't think it's

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,820
I don't think it's all the time and I

00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,610
haven't checked because it's hard to add

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,570
yourself on Facebook to be like to do

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,830
that you'd have to make a fake facebook

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,910
account which violates the Terms of

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,910
Service and so I wouldn't do that

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,990
would it be possible to make an app

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,180
which would allow people to actually use

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,420
this as a legitimate sleep tracking up

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,610
for themselves hmm that's a good

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,930
question haven't thought of that because

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,260
it's automatic right the data is there

00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,420
for free I had a brief look I don't

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,390
think like Facebook apps or pages or

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,800
whatever can see this about you like for

00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,270
example if I could the app the way the

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,410
way that I know that it works is you be

00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,180
someone's friend and then you can see

00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,170
whether their online offline but for

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,340
this app that you're talking about the

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,690
app would also have to be able to see

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,060
you because you can't spy on yourself

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,170
you can only only someone else can spy

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,450
on you if you using the same thing as me

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,980
so you'd have to find a way for the app

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,240
to be able to see your messenger status

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,490
and maybe that exists in the Facebook

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:21,100
API is officially or unofficially bad

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:28,720
inner question feel free to just like

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:29,950
heckle me just go for it all right thank

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,980
you give him another round of applause

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,980
