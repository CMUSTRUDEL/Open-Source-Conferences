Title: Turning stories into websites
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2016
Description: 
	Donna Benjamin
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/65/view_talk
The user story sits at the centre of most agile development methodologies. 

But what makes a good story? and where do stories come from? What do we do with them once they've been estimated, prioritised, re-sized and broken down? How can we maintain our sense of the big picture when it's broken down into tiny puzzle pieces? How does that help us build good products?

This talk puts the focus on the "user" telling the story to understand their requirements for the product. It then turns back to the team to look at how we hear and discuss those stories in order to bring them to life to build the product, and build it right.

the open australia foundation please

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,609
welcome Donna and her talk turning

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,609
stories into websites

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:54,850
stories transform us stories connect us

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,960
stories make us human I'm going to talk

00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,739
about turning stories into websites I'm

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,770
a web therapist people tell me about

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:18,310
their websites and I help them make them

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:21,009
better so doesn't want to nope something

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:27,460
is not happy with my moving things

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:29,860
forward so that's me who are you I'm

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,550
making some assumptions but I would like

00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:39,039
to test these hands up if you're a

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:41,920
developer most of you hands up if you're

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:45,789
a project manager or a scrum master

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,610
something like that less of you maybe 10

00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:53,039
percentage what about a business owner

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:56,170
or a website owner even fewer of you

00:01:53,039 --> 00:02:00,630
something else other kinds of roles in

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:06,729
the software space yell out a couple

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:11,170
student scientists other things so I've

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:16,209
got a mix but primarily developers how

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:18,730
many of you work in teams most of you

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:24,640
very cool so hands up if you're already

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,050
familiar with agile use user stories not

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,700
quite everybody let me do that the other

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,290
way around hands up if you have no idea

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:35,980
and I've never heard of an agile user

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:37,629
story a couple of you okay so how many

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,980
of you are actually using agile

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:45,370
methodology in your day-to-day work sort

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,090
of half ish and some ish scrum meesh

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:54,670
waterfall scrum scrum foolish okay cool

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:56,040
thank you that's useful so let's start

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,340
with the basic

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,740
stories in particular user stories

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,950
what's a user story and what are they

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,900
for so there's a common pattern many

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:14,310
people use when drafting user stories it

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:21,490
goes a bit like this as our user I

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:25,600
require so I can familiar right here's

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,180
an example as a goat I require a /

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,470
programmer who can help me out so that

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,709
the work gets done with multiple

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,770
perspectives thanks to go to user

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,390
stories for that one it's silly but this

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,910
is the thing is i think these use a

00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,070
story kind of Temple that has kind of

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,930
gotten a little bit old we might have

00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,430
started taking it for granted and we

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,350
might have forgotten what user stories

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,760
are actually all about and that's where

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,490
I wanted to sort of get back to that

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,650
essential that essential quality of a

00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,300
story that I started with that stories

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,270
are actually fundamentally part of who

00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,550
we are and what we do as human beings in

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,700
some ways user stories have replaced

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,330
traditional requirements at least that's

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,610
the great hope the reality is that that

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,489
just kind of become a different kind of

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,250
requirement but let's again let's try

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,790
and you know reel it back in and say

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,519
well what is the story for the I require

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,620
is a key part of it so if there's a kind

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,530
of a clue that right we still need to

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:32,400
know what our users need what they want

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,320
and what it is they think they require

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,150
so how can we find out what our users

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,950
what how can we find out what they want

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,510
if they don't even know which is common

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,760
so there's a few methods that I have

00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,160
kind of been directly involved with or

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,630
aware of or etc and I imagine that

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,180
they're going to be familiar to many of

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,910
you I want to kind of get a sort of

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,470
vigorous nodding if you have been sort

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,760
of a direct either participant or

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:06,010
perhaps victim of one of these methods

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,720
the good old workshop right workshops

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,780
are a great way to create shared

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,540
understanding and agree

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,280
of people great way to sort of get a

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,740
sense of where we're all out to share

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,250
knowledge to make it visible workshops

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,610
are a good one what about interviews all

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,919
right one-on-one interviews are a really

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,990
great way to go deeper to have a real

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,260
conversation with someone to under to

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,270
sort of uncover what their underlying

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,460
requirements are to ask them why to get

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,010
them to explain to put it in the context

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,380
to really drive it back to the value

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,410
that you meant to be delivering then

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,540
there's surveys who's used surveys yep

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,980
great I mean this is a really good way

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,090
of getting that kind of super valuable

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,070
quantitative data as opposed to the

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,860
qualitative data you might get in in

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,630
interviews it also is really nice and

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,070
graphical so that you know when you're

00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,780
wanting to communicate that back to

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,850
stakeholders about the value or the

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,900
reasons why you're doing things you can

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,000
make pretty graphs and people go ah then

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,110
there's competitive analysis I don't

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,410
know that I'm using the right word here

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,270
so I kind of think this is like where

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,640
you go and see well who else is doing

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,440
this in our space what are they doing

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,720
how they approaching these challenges

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,150
perhaps take screenshots of the websites

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,830
get a sense of the lay of the land use

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,560
that as a way of saying well here's our

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,990
shopping list of things we want to build

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,370
anyone do does that yeah few knots and

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,620
then finally you have no idea you have

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,360
no idea what your users want or need you

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,460
have an idea that you think they might

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,600
want or need so prototype it build it

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:48,590
test it share it and iterate yeah then

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:53,060
you've got this list of requirements

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,169
right so it's you know it's tested and

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,669
you've done your surveys and you've done

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,960
your workshops you've got this long list

00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,539
of requirements which is really great

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,460
now how do you now take that next stitch

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:05,840
from the shopping list of things to

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,330
build into a beautifully groomed product

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,510
backlog that you can make a start on how

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,610
might you do that who turn of invest as

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:18,800
a way of breaking down requirements is

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,409
this new excellent okay so this was

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,500
actually a minimum active elip by a guy

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,300
called bill wake

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,610
he's been working a lot in this space

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,150
he's a senior consultant at industrial

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:34,710
logic and he came up with this nice way

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:38,030
of looking at character or getting into

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,740
our user story so I is independent

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,540
stories should be independent they

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,160
should stand alone you should be able to

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,920
build them in any order they should not

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,560
have dependencies on other things n

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,850
negotiable at the stage where you've got

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,910
to use a story and it's written down

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,560
it's not written in stone you should

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,230
still be able to negotiate the details

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,870
they should still be a communication

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,970
process around that story and you should

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,230
be able to figure out the acceptance

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:12,570
criteria and this should be a

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:14,820
conversation and negotiation valuable if

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,190
the story that you're building is not

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,050
about delivering value in some way or

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,930
another directly to the product the

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:26,870
business customer whoever why are you

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:31,830
doing it this is a fundamental one small

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:35,120
can you do it within a sprint within an

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,240
afternoon before lunch is it actually

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,229
oversized that's achievable within the

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,370
arbitrary allotted amount of time that

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:48,960
you have it needs to be oh I'm sorry I

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,990
must be confusing you that's meant to be

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,570
e in the estimable I'm jumping ahead

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,089
estimable can you estimate what's

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,850
involved how long it's going to take do

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:03,480
you have the skills etc and then you've

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:07,910
got school sorry about that so all I

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,760
just said about that and then T testable

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,180
can you actually test that it is doing

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,330
what the customer client citizen who

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,860
ever want it right can you test it do

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,690
you have acceptance criteria is there

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,250
something to test or is it all a bit

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,990
kind of vague and hand wavy no one's

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,700
ever going to be able to test it well

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,860
that's a good red herring Rick sort of

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,690
good red flag that you haven't got a

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,259
good solid story to start with invest

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,360
it's a good one I think yes

00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:43,139
15 minutes oh wow okay I've got a rush

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,059
so if any of this stuff is new to you

00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,579
then I really strongly recommend you

00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,769
look at user stories applied by Mike

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,149
cone even if it's not new to you and you

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,149
haven't checked this out it's kind of

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:57,509
like this Bible of how to do usual story

00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,480
so very very strongly recommend having a

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:03,619
look at that but when we talk about user

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,360
stories it's really easy to get lost in

00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:08,910
in the details and to lose sight of that

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,579
incredible internet important big

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,689
picture so one way to avoid that is by

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:17,970
using story mapping use a story mapping

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,829
by Jeff patent is a really is a great

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,480
another great book filled with practical

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,209
examples on how to make sure that your

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,249
user stories fit into a big picture and

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,379
are tied back to the objectives that

00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,689
you're trying to achieve in a you know

00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,860
for the for the project as a whole

00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:34,199
perhaps for the organization as a whole

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,399
so this is a really good way to kind of

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:41,220
make sure you keep your eyes on the

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:45,869
prize so you've got your user stories

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,970
you've um estimated how you know you've

00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:50,009
made them all really good user stories

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,009
and buildable how do you actually then

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:55,980
take the very next step now most of you

00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:58,049
said you work in teams so it's probably

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,339
no surprise that teamwork might be part

00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:04,649
of the puzzle so what do you do with a

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,769
user story do you just go off into a

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,689
little cubicle and start coding or do

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,149
you have a conversation and this is

00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:13,920
where I want to again let's get away

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,959
from the template and the product

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,029
backlog and all this scrum terminology

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,670
and get back to the idea of good

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:25,559
storytelling do we understand who the

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:28,529
protagonist of the story is are we

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,119
talking about faceless icons as users or

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,040
do we really know who the people are

00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:34,499
that we're building it for can we have a

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,420
conversation about them so teamwork is

00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:38,639
really important we tell each other the

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,009
stories we estimate the effort involved

00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,569
together do we have the skills do we

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:48,499
have the shared understanding of what

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:50,719
we're building group dynamics

00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:52,819
is part of it when we talk about the

00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:55,159
skills we also need to know that we have

00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:57,169
skills that we are complementary that we

00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,319
have the right mix that we have people

00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:01,369
who are strong in some areas and maybe

00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,709
understand the others but can work

00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:07,009
together who's heard of tockman's model

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,989
of group dynamics the forming norming

00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,149
storming performing so it's more nods

00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:13,129
there right you know we've got it you've

00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,469
got to know where you are in the journey

00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,329
so as a team kind of understand where

00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,439
you're at have you just been are you for

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,729
new people who've been brought together

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,019
for the first time and you have to

00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:23,119
figure out who you are and where you fit

00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,799
or have you been working together for a

00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:27,349
long time and already have kind of got

00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,299
established a groove this matters to the

00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:34,459
way you can actually implement things

00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:37,429
and then there's telling stories I sort

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:40,279
of preempted this a little bit by

00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:44,179
actually having at that time within the

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,979
team to talk about each user story each

00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,139
requirement but actually telling the

00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:50,599
story about why we're building that

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:52,669
feature and for who and is it valuable

00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:54,519
that we have that in a conversational

00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:57,439
narrative kind of way it's not just a

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,629
shopping list you know of stuff to build

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,339
there's got to be a reason why and the

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:05,449
next we are beginning a middle and an

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:07,399
end the estimating effort do you sit

00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:09,349
down do you agree are we in agreement

00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,509
that this is easy are we in agreement

00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:14,269
that this is no way we can do this in

00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,949
the sprint building the shared

00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:18,409
understanding of exactly what we're

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,419
building is really important it is the

00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,220
only way we can move from the shopping

00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:25,519
list of requirements or user stories

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,720
into a whole product or website or

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,849
whatever it is that you're building

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,369
prioritizing what's important working

00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:36,439
with stakeholders and each other to

00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:42,470
focus on delivering value to the user is

00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:44,449
why we play with user stories one of the

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:48,439
ways of kind of having that conversation

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:53,449
is to think about the habitat there's

00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:57,229
this great Welsh world can even can Evan

00:13:53,449 --> 00:14:00,649
is a model for sense making it was first

00:13:57,229 --> 00:14:02,360
developed by Dave Snowden in 1999 in the

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,510
context of knowledge management

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,100
and organizational strategy it's the

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,320
word sort of signifies the multiple

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,620
factors in our environment and our

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,910
experience that influences the ways that

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:20,829
we behave within that environment it's

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:25,360
for sense-making not for categorizing

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:31,570
there's obvious or simple there's

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:35,540
complicated there's complex chaotic and

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:40,670
disorder I'm just going to go back to

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:45,019
the map whoops one too many obvious or

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,700
simple complicated complex or chaotic so

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,740
you're looking at a list of things and

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,510
you know you get some of them to go I

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,399
know what that is I can build that I've

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,950
done it before I have the knowledge have

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,630
the skills have the tools I can just get

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,250
on with it we can deplete we can employ

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,000
this practice here because it's a known

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,220
quantity this is complicated you may not

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,899
know but you know someone who does or

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,519
someone else in the team or someone else

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,610
in the organization or you can bring in

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,310
an expert easily to kind of uncover it

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,959
and make it clear complex the rules are

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,910
quite different you don't actually know

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,110
you're going to have to do some tests

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,640
you're going to have to experiment a

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,640
little bit first to find the right way

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:27,740
you might be developing good practice as

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:31,850
a way of doing that chaotic is almost

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,440
like disaster zone stuff your your

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,600
relief workers going into a disaster

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
zone you just have to act you have to

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,660
react you have to respond you don't have

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,470
time to do planning and thinking and

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,180
testing and in the middle is disorder no

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,160
rules apply there's not enough data are

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,370
you can't really make sense of what's

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,990
going on tricky down here you can't

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,380
quite see it but you can always slip

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,760
from the obvious simple into chaotic if

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,490
something changes perhaps the server

00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,350
goes down so this is Kevin it's a really

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,420
good way of just sort of beginning to

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,610
get a sense of the big picture and where

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,250
things might fit within it who's heard

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,470
of that one before another new one

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,760
awesome okay sorry now going to fast

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,250
forward complex chaotic disorder so

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,080
getting down now more into the specific

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,530
what are we building what do we want to

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,110
build ah clicky clicky is not loving me

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,330
today alright conference website I think

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,560
we should all be familiar the conference

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:33,410
website yes good accounts one example um

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,540
what about a media sharing website

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,820
something where you upload and share

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,320
videos of stuff has anyone heard of

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,540
something like that before that they

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,640
might be familiar with okay so that's

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,840
another thing or a research agency

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,820
website something where you're getting

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,800
have to put a lot of data of one kind or

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,600
another probably some of you are

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,660
familiar with this so I move you perhaps

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,870
less huh well you know who's using these

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,890
kinds of websites personas so again

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,560
getting back to that storytelling

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,760
remember what I said about do you know

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,380
who the protagonist in the story is

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,819
personas are a good way of making

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,079
faceless user icons into real people so

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,750
let's use one of those examples

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,680
conference website nice and easy we're

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:23,209
all familiar with that adds a potential

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,670
delegate I want to know the date of the

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,250
conference so I can see if it suits my

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:32,300
schedule this year or perhaps as a

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:35,060
future speaker I want to submit a talk

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,280
proposal so that I might be invited to

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:43,360
speak at this conference achievement

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:45,950
unlocked as a conference organizer I

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,560
need to review and evaluate talk

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,390
proposals so we can create a good

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,930
conference program so you see that

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:58,550
familiar template assigned to different

00:17:52,930 --> 00:18:02,540
types of users which kind of fall very

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:06,050
nicely into user roles or I think in say

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,330
Django user groups role-based access

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,590
control and sort of broader PHP all

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,230
sorts of different systems have

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,600
different ways of managing this so

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,390
there's anonymous users our potential

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,980
delegates authenticated users our

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,050
speakers admin users our organizers now

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,060
conveniently Drupal 8 which while I'm

00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,850
familiar with and its standard install

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,230
profile has those sorts of three roles

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,150
just handy

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,520
out of the box eNOS I think was what was

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,669
said on Friday as a good way out of the

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,100
box has these three roles built in and

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,600
then you can get into sort of granular

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,010
permissions so you've got to figure out

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,049
what's that user doing what value are

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,730
they creating what do they need to be

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,860
doing there on hide stuff from them they

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:53,900
don't need to access you can assign one

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,890
or more you know permissions to one or

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,570
more rocks Django has some similar stuff

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,549
as do most systems and frameworks at

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,500
least to some extent so so far so good

00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,450
we've had a bunch of speakers submit

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,400
talks we review reviewed proposals

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,660
accepted some and published our program

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,000
her are all good right huh we've got

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,640
some pesky speakers though I've come

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,700
back to us and said so I want to like

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,030
promote my talk on social media can you

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,520
make that easier for me I'm a harried

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,380
conference organizer sure I can do that

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,040
and we can hack our system and Eddie

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,470
things at this stage not anyway I'm as a

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,410
speaker with an accepted talk I'm going

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,880
to share my talk on social media so that

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,950
people will come to see it put all of

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,400
you you're here fabulous so this also

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,460
must have worked so we've identified a

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,470
user need here right let's do some

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,850
competitor analysis to refine that

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:56,090
requirement this is a working example

00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,410
from lanyard about the session well not

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,690
this session but when I did this talk

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,210
once before we could ask our users

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,790
stakeholder so did you want something

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,380
like this so let's just keep it simple

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,360
and say yes clicking on each logo should

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:16,130
pre populate a post with the URL

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,720
insertion details kind of like this yeah

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,030
this is a model that works so this is a

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,250
sort of tried and true pattern so we can

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,919
get this down into the sort of simple or

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:30,410
obvious phrase of key area of Kevin so

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,460
then if I was to get into implement it

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,280
I'm going to go through this really

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,380
quickly choosing a right contributed

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,080
module in a Drupal world is kind of part

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,400
of the dark art of how it all works

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,260
fortunately the drupal association did

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,760
some work to kind of make that easier as

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,400
a resource guide

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,260
um his website that I had been working

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,190
on at some point that you know has an

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:55,760
input implemented this get in under the

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,890
hood get some clues you know something

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,420
in there I see service links okay so

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,640
that gives me a clue that I should look

00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:07,310
at the service links module which kind

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,600
of does exactly what I want so I brush

00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,520
through that very quickly all right so

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,620
to kind of bring it all together the

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,650
general kind of a jolly world we have

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,170
these user stories we need to kind of

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,660
make them make sure that they represent

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,220
what our users want we need to work

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,440
together to understand that we're

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,040
building the right thing that we can

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,870
build it that it's doable and we

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,730
ultimately their need to implement this

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,710
within one of these systems that we use

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,710
whatever they might be whether it's

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,770
Python PHP Django mezzanine wagtail

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:42,770
something entirely different the process

00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,730
should apply regardless so who here

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,690
knows has heard of the agile manifesto

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,540
most of you so I'm not going to read it

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,900
out you know what it is I kind of

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,680
distilled it down into this its people

00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:01,160
who collaborate that make products

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,010
evolve this is how we can bring stories

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,380
to life by working together and by

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:14,540
understanding the people who are at the

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:16,250
heart of those stories I have a bunch of

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,030
references i will put the slides online

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,630
so you can go and get details and that

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,630
is all i have to say

00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:37,690
Taniya yes Thank You Donna that was

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,389
really good and I think we're going to

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,820
have lots of reading to go and do as

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:45,460
well as some nice new terms like

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:50,019
cinnamon can even can even that's all

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:53,590
yeah um one of the things you mentioned

00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:55,029
was competitive analysis and I was

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,610
wondering if you have any more advice

00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,499
about how to go from we should have this

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,350
feature because our competitors do to

00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:04,090
something that is perhaps more

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,820
user-focused look I think that's an

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,830
incredibly good question how do we kind

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,200
of break that thing of like everyone's

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,749
got this so we need at two and then

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,919
bringing it back to we'll hang on what's

00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:17,529
out how does that meet our objectives

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,149
not just because it's the Joneses have

00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,700
it but how does it meet our objectives

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:24,519
what are our users want have any of our

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,070
users asked for it is just push back if

00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,450
I mean it's easy to say that sometimes

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,460
you're not in an environment where you

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,830
can but kind of working towards that

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,749
again that teamwork thing of saying wait

00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,809
wait wait let's make sure every single

00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:40,269
thing we build is moving towards one of

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:41,860
our objectives and that's what the Jeff

00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:43,690
patterns use a story mapping one is

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,879
really good you might remember in that

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,519
picture there were four blue kind of try

00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:50,679
um diamonds at the top that was their

00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,179
kind of organizational objectives and

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,159
every single thing that they were

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,049
building within that story map aligned

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,879
back to one of those objectives and I

00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:59,799
think that's a really powerful idea

00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:01,299
because we do often get stuck in the

00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,590
details of building this little thing

00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,820
because we think we sure door because

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,249
it's the next thing on the list it's

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,470
like wait wait wait where is the value

00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,940
and if you can get that conversation

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,759
happening in your organization then

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,049
you're going to be a long way towards

00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:20,200
preventing that kind of let's build it

00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:22,059
because they've got it I am how granular

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,559
should you get in the storyteller in

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:28,450
telling the stories it's about they also

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,190
when I sort of messed up the order of

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,659
those but they should be small but not

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,879
too small if you can do it in five

00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,169
minutes probably a little bit too small

00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:37,359
for a user story and they might want to

00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:39,160
bundle up a little collection of them so

00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,260
you want to kind of keep it at a

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,120
reasonable sense but there's a lot of

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,800
stuff going on in the agile world where

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,480
it gets very much about the method and

00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,310
the process and less about the building

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,530
and the doing make it something

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:54,940
realistic and and you know kind of um

00:24:52,530 --> 00:25:07,150
satisfying if it's too small and bitsy

00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:08,830
it's not kind of deliver does that just

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,270
for the recording yes you can spend an

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,370
awful lot of time at the beginning

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,350
creating all these user stories without

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,970
really getting down to the work one of

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,070
the other kind of you know rules of

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,990
thumb is at the beginning you can have

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:24,340
very big undefined Christians or apex

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,410
only get down to the details when you

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,930
need to otherwise you might never ever

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,330
get there so keep it big until you need

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,280
to multiple process yes if that's her

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,900
out exactly and i think that one of the

00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,760
really nice analogies i saw is you kind

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,590
of have this think of it as a map that

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,850
you know you want to zoom right in and

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,410
get to the details when you're just

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,940
around the corner but when you're trying

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,800
to get to the outside from Melbourne to

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,620
Perth you probably don't really want

00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,130
that detail so be in the right place at

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,860
the right time good question yes I'm

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,530
just on the topic of you know making

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,900
sure that what you're producing has the

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,940
most business value that's really your

00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,960
ordered product backlog that's where

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,340
that comes in so for it yeah I am just I

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,450
was worried if you had any advice on

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,040
like as an agency of a larger business

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,930
we've got about 30 staff members we've

00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,260
got maybe four in the marketing team a

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:22,000
couple of IT guys the sort of umbrella

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:24,310
agency has probably 30 people in their

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,260
marketing team to maintain a website so

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,270
our marketing people look at that go we

00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,520
need that but it's like well we don't

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,390
have the resources to do that say when

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,610
you're looking at the competitive

00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:37,360
competitor analysis other ways to curb

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:39,160
expectations and try and bring them in a

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,440
little bit that's a really good question

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,650
Gavin and I don't think I do have a good

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,590
answer on that one that is that's kind

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,660
of yeah you you will get unreasonable

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,780
requests that don't fit in but again I

00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,850
guess like I said to to Brianna

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,760
is that if you can tie it back to the

00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,610
you know some objective rather than just

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,380
this is shiny and we wanted then maybe

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,350
that's a way through is just just bring

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,990
it back to business value or customer

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,910
value whatever it is to just try and

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,340
have that conversation and rather than

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,350
kind of be reactive perhaps it's like

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,210
well why why do you want that I know

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,620
they've got it in its shiny but what are

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,510
you trying to achieve with it maybe we

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:27,580
can do it in a different way and that

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:29,140
takes the conversation somewhere else so

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,490
although we never really talked about it

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,620
in these terms there's a lot of

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,860
applications here in research but

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,570
they're the the stories are extremely

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,060
iterative and so I was wondering if you

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,080
could comment on how to apply the sort

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,880
of model where you're talking to your

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,860
collaborator and they want to do this

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,570
and then you do that and then you get an

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,950
answer and then that informs the next

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,280
step of the experiment and it just sort

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:53,740
of continues sorry I I always like to

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,250
try and apply things that don't fit it's

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,600
always fun but I think in some ways the

00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,040
can even model is probably really

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,840
interesting there in terms of the

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,210
complex side of things where you're

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,260
actually wanting to do Tet you it that

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,790
whole model is about test probe and do

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,340
safe to fail kind of experiments you so

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,380
well did this work did this get get us

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,120
there and probably also fits in the

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,440
prototype and iterate kind of space

00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,240
where you go well let's build it and see

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,880
how that goes and do that kind of

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,610
hypothesis and test so it's not it may

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,380
not necessarily be doing the kind of you

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,660
know building a product backlog but much

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,550
more immediately iterative so I don't

00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,110
know that you need to necessarily bolt

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,210
it on but I think the general principle

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,190
of have the conversation and work

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,230
together productively as a team should

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,030
still apply does that help I don't think

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,330
I answered that question but I'll get

00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:46,960
away with it for now maybe one more

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:49,870
question I don't want to hold you from

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,400
morning from afternoon tea alright so my

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,180
question is when you have a project that

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,950
has a lot of technical stuff going on

00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,080
sort of kicking along below the surface

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,510
you often end up with us what seems like

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,040
a very small user story of a small bit

00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,190
of thing for a user which ends up having

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,289
a huge number of technical

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,779
things I need to be achieved yeah how do

00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,669
you reconcile that against user stories

00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:16,330
when you want to make your user stories

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:17,919
estimable and small when a small thing

00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,200
for a user ends up being a huge thing

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,120
for the development team look I don't

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,250
have a good answer for that one I'm

00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,809
sorry and there are variations of that

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,000
question that have come up every time

00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:29,710
I've done this talk and that is the

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,210
other one is like we've got technical

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,730
stuff we need to do which isn't

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,799
represented for the user it delivers no

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,720
value it from their perspective so what

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,450
you do need to lower say well why are

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,179
you doing it like will it make the

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,789
platform faster will it mean we can

00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,549
respond more quickly and effectively in

00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:50,409
the future but to try I mean sometimes

00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:53,049
it's just not possible and I accept that

00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:54,429
and you have to kind of do that but you

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,710
know sometimes you just have to try and

00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,240
find a hook into it so it's more about

00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,769
when you're actually splitting it up

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,450
when trying to estimate something for

00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:02,590
your development team if you want a

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,779
great your estimates based on user

00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,159
stories you have one user story and that

00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:07,809
might be a really important thing that

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,029
you definitely that definitely provides

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,860
a heap of value but you still need to

00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:13,000
split it up so you can estimate it so

00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,610
when you're entering things into your

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,039
ticket tracker what are you putting in

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,320
well is if it starts as an epic and you

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,450
need to break it down it can be there as

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,889
an epic and you can say well how might

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,470
we break it down and there are lots of

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:28,539
different things I mean I talked about

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,100
invest there's also another kind of min

00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:31,450
am on it called smart and I can't reward

00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,059
that is off the top of my head but

00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,399
things also like crud so you know is

00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,899
there a technical way of kind of slicing

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,190
this onion if we cut it this way we get

00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,320
rings if we cut it this way we get

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,200
wedges to actually just start to attack

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,330
it and say how can we make it find out

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,519
the components or they call decomposing

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,830
and epic and I think there's a real dark

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,529
art involved in that and you bring you

00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:56,620
know the full kind of diverse strength

00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:58,210
of your team to the problem when you get

00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,340
a really gnarly one like that especially

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,529
when it's got lots of user value then

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,779
you really invested in trying to get it

00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,330
right good question I don't think that

00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,740
answered it but really good question can

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,070
we please get down another round of

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,070
