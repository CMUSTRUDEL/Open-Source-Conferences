Title: Mental Health in Development
Publication date: 2016-08-15
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2016
Description: 
	Eloise Macdonald-Meyer
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/179/view_talk
This talk will explore the various mental health pressures and impacts that development can have, as well as the strategies developers, and their workplaces, can use to deal with them to support those who may be suffering.
Many conversations have been started about mental health in technology, and it is important for these to continue. Parts of the development process can sometimes lead to situations where looking after yourself can be difficult and it is important not only to be able to minimise the risk of these, but to be able to recognise them and find ways out of them. 
On the other hand, the amount of technology to help combat mental health is increasing, and what better demographic to test, use and further develop these technologies than developers themselves. This talk will also discuss the rise and continuity of technology to assist in mental health.

alright for welcome back and for the

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,900
last session in this block I'd like it

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,309
says here Eloise but this is ducky she's

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,440
a computing student she works part-time

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,870
as a web developer at a Tasmanian

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,190
webbing web agency take flight her main

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,570
technical interests are in games

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,609
technology human-computer interaction

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,100
geographic information systems and any

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:31,320
way she can combine all three everyone

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:35,430
please welcome to stage ducky hello hi

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,250
there's a lot of you um I'm ducky I just

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,230
want to do a quick check does anyone

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,329
have any kind of vision impairments like

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,100
you're on see everything on that slide

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,140
very easily like shaky hand if you can't

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,899
otherwise i can like describe what's on

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,320
the screen for you later no oh good

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,590
awesome so as Russell read out I like

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,440
and do many things probably things that

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,120
you might like or do too so you know we

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,780
should talk sometime maybe after this

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,540
talk I'll be around for afternoon tea

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,610
something I don't do i have is i am not

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,010
a health professional i do not have any

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,810
qualifications in that area so that's a

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,580
bit of a disclaimer and why because as

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,890
you may already know i'm going to be

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,930
talking about mental health and i'm

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,390
going to be talking about its currents

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,520
and effects in the technology and

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,439
development kind of spheres so hopefully

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,340
something that you might all be able to

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,320
relate to in the tech department so yeah

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,750
because I'm not a professional this talk

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,939
is basically a compilation of personal

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,270
and shared experiences that I have from

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,810
myself obviously personal and from other

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,479
people lots of anecdotal evidence and

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,460
lots of papers I've read because I like

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,729
to read papers in my spare time some

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,960
reason so first a bit of foundation for

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,670
the top what is mental health so after

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,460
here we've got a great quote from food

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,000
as its most simplest kind of form is the

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,310
capacity to work and to love the more

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,129
kind of broad definition from Wikipedia

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,550
there a reliable source it is is a

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:15,760
mental health is a level of sight

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,430
logical well being so the World Health

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,400
Organization says that this can be

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,240
subjective too well being perceived

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,950
self-efficacy autonomy competence and

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,040
international intergenerational

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,270
dependence as well as self actualization

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,050
of one's intellectual and emotional

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:40,150
potential among a lot of other things so

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,380
this I got actually admit it can be

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,260
affected by a lot of things like

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,060
cultural differences so other subjective

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,400
assessments and competing professional

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,170
theories I think that last one comes

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,250
into play a lot when we're talking about

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,930
the technology and development so one

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,030
important thing about this is mental

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,250
health does not mean mental illness

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,460
mental illness is a part of mental

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,080
health so mentally risk is part of poor

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,480
mental health and can lead to lots of

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,720
things like physical symptoms as well as

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,450
wider effects on people's lives so why

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,170
are we talking about mental health well

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,870
it's has a bit of a stigma which I like

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,610
to think is it is being slowly December

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,560
tires thanks to lots of people talking

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,170
openly about it education and awareness

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,760
of it is generally increasing but I

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,340
still think it's really important that

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,290
we talk more and more about it so that

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,730
we can help each other and find out

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,410
better ways to how we can help so

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,160
obviously if we have more awareness in

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,350
education that will lead to more good

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,510
mental health which is the smiley face

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,600
whereas poor mental health can lead to a

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,340
range of more negative emotions and this

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,630
is slightly inaccurate because good

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,450
mental health does not mean that you

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,980
can't be sad and have other emotions you

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,770
can still be perfectly a mentally

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,370
healthy and experience a wide range of

00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:07,360
emotions just the negative ones in poor

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,120
mental health can be even worse so yeah

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,489
that's why we're talking about it and

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,730
another really important thing is mental

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,890
health is not just depression there are

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,799
so many parts of mental health lots of

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,180
different symptoms so just keep that in

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,630
mind when we're talking about some of

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,840
the strategies that we're going to

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,930
discuss

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,070
through help this talk yes meant for

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,080
mental health can come in many shapes

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,850
and sizes so why is it important in

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,190
development obviously our development

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,620
processes aren't directly tied into our

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:46,570
brains yet yes maybe one day so for in

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,220
development there can be some risks I

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,260
mean we do use our brains a lot in

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,750
development or at least I hope most of

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:58,600
us do sorry I found with tech a lot of

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,760
us have tech as a hobby and our jobs and

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,139
that means a lot of us can be really

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,510
passionate about this and that is

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,790
wonderful like it's been really

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,620
inspiring coming into technology and

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,690
development because i still feel quite

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,930
new I only into this when i first

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,720
started University but that can also

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,820
lead to some downfalls so as Russell

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,180
said I'm really interested in games in

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,650
the games industry in general and

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,030
recently I think in the last year

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,669
there's been a few people in the games

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,350
industry who came out with long essays

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,650
about how if you're not passionate

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,240
enough to work non-stop no sleep no

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,490
breaks then you shouldn't be in this

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,889
industry and I really disagree with that

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,930
I think work-life balance is really

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,430
important and I think all the evidence

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,910
with mental health are really backs me

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,110
up there so while we're a lot of us are

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,300
really passionate and how this is a

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,070
hobby and our job and that can maybe

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,080
seem like our entire lives it's

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,060
important to be able to take steps back

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,300
and balance that with the rest of our

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,910
life so there's some other things in

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,320
development for people who might not see

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,060
technologies their entire life which is

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,450
good it's really good to have other

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,570
disciplines involved things like crunch

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,120
time has has anyone ever gone through a

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,780
development cycle that has ended up in a

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:22,560
crunch time oh that's good that's not

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:25,479
good okay so crenshaw may have been

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,870
difficult straining very stressful I

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:31,180
imagine I try not to have crunch times

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,099
but I definitely do it in university

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,979
assessments a lot I definitely leave way

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,659
too much the last minute and yeah that's

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,460
something that a lot of Delta life

00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,380
cycles try to avoid but

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,560
there are a lot of reasons that in

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,150
technology we still get there another

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,729
thing in development is there's a lot of

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,770
freelancers so I looked up some stats

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:52,479
for this or at least I had a lovely

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,789
helfer in the audience Thank You Adam

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,530
look up some stats from the ABS from

00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:01,990
2014 not the most recent census and

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,199
found out there's about there's nearly

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,789
20,000 freelancers in Australia that's

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,039
just Australia alone which makes further

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:11,440
up for about ten percent of the ICT

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,380
industry and that's that's quite a lot

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,960
of people so freelancing in technology

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,030
and anything comes with its own trials

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,830
and tribulations and I imagine there's a

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,020
lot of strain there just in open source

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,599
communities just when you have people

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,530
maintaining things in like smaller and

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,139
smaller groups that leads to a lot of

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,330
risks for the mental health as well so I

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,820
want to try this audience participation

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,280
thing because as you're just just soo

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,169
ins talk and I really liked it can

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
anybody else think of some risks in

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:52,210
development that might lead to some

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:54,460
mental health problems frustration so

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,680
frustration with trying to get something

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,930
working trying to get a piece of code

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:06,550
you just can't figure out where that bug

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:09,639
is anything else applied pressure for

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,289
management so I guess a lot of the time

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,030
we might be working with people who

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,099
don't understand what we're doing and

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,199
how it works and they might not

00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:20,469
understand that they're putting on time

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:30,130
pressures that really can't do it so

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:32,500
that's a really good one yeah excellent

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,029
so sitting for a long time when we're

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,919
developing a lot of us are probably

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,149
sitting down those standing desks are on

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,149
the rise and

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:54,620
I didn't even mean that I swear whose no

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,200
pun intended um so yeah prolonged

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,760
sitting there are so many papers out

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,500
there right now it's telling us how

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,420
prolonged sitting is really bad for us

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,430
there there are a few jesting that

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,470
standing isn't super great Ethan's

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,260
that's too without posture and I am

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,050
definitely bad with that there's lots of

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,180
treadmill desks hopefully one day via

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,410
that's definitely anything also if we're

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,770
encouraged to work longer and longer

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,870
hours that doesn't help that either can

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:27,050
anybody think of anything else yes

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,820
multitasking ah how many I have about

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:34,190
two monitors who has more than two

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,870
monitors I am so jealous babe if you've

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,700
got through more than two monitors you

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,740
probably got lots of different things on

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,660
the screen so multitasking when you've

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,520
got to try and move your mind around all

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,270
these different things that could

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,280
definitely cause a strain cool so as you

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,670
can see there's lots of risk factors in

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,570
development and technology so what can

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,130
we do it just won't go away well one of

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,589
the things we can do is talk about it

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,690
try and D stigmatize it because a lot of

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,450
people think if they talk about it they

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:09,350
could lose their jobs other people might

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:12,110
judge them in a negative light so I'm

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,440
trying to do my bit by talking to you

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,290
guys and hopefully this helps but

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,810
there's more things we can do so as

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,690
individuals we could go to the talk

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,730
that's in this very room after afternoon

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,560
tea because I hear there's going to be a

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,589
great one about phone out and strategies

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,980
to do with that p.s self-care is a

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:36,800
really big part so recognizing things

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,570
that make you tick and like what when

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,730
you're about to take a downward turn

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,880
because nobody knows you better than you

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,770
know yourself so finding out finding

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,630
talks like this and going through the

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,280
internet to find other things and

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,260
recognizing the signs within yourself

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,459
for when you think things are about to

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,769
go downhill and don't

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:59,579
don't be afraid to put your health

00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:01,649
before a project so especially in open

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,119
source lots of people might think lots

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,040
like everyone's relying on you you're

00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:08,220
the only person who can do this job it's

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,160
okay to take a step back without you

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,279
being there and being healthy then

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,869
that's not going to get done anyway and

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,079
there are lots of people on the way in

00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:22,379
the world that can help so asking people

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:26,670
to help and putting yourself your self

00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:29,910
and your health first I'm also going to

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,480
try a little practical exercise right

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,470
now so there's this a very popular kind

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,529
of notion at the moment called

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,350
mindfulness and it's it's a type of

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:42,540
meditation and a mental state which can

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,559
be achieved by focusing your awareness

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,399
on the present moment while calmly

00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,249
acknowledging and accepting your

00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,709
feelings so feeling that you might be

00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:57,149
stressed or anxious like if you're

00:11:52,709 --> 00:12:00,329
giving a talk and just focusing on that

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:02,879
and just being okay with that that is

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,769
happening to you it's there it's not

00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,129
going to be there forever and it's not

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,379
actually hurting you right now so I'm

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,269
gonna try one of these exercises I

00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:16,079
actually do this one sometimes when I'm

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,939
trying to go to sleep and I've somewhat

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,799
found it useful I know a lot of people

00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,679
find a lot more useful than I do because

00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,600
I don't do it very often but hopefully

00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,959
it might help some of you so I'm gonna

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,019
ask you all to close your eyes I promise

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:36,899
nothing bad will happen to you and I was

00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:40,949
in the room so just close your eyes now

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:44,610
I just want you to breathe in and out in

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:47,420
and out now I want you to draw your

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,079
attention down to the soles of your feet

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,929
maybe one foot maybe both foot just feel

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,589
the soles of your foot ah soles of your

00:12:54,929 --> 00:13:02,160
feet now maybe move up to your toes feel

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,169
your pinky toe don't try and move it or

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,580
tense it or anything just just feel it

00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:10,710
it's there

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:14,720
I hope now move up to your big toe it's

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:18,090
also there and move up your ankle ankle

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,260
it might feel a bit inkling so you're

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:25,590
just feeling your ankle now slowly move

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,830
up your car feel your calf muscles try

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:36,540
not to tense them will move them be with

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:39,900
them up to your knees and then I'm gonna

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:45,360
get you to open your eyes cuz otherwise

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:48,390
the talk will go over time so hopefully

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,340
that's got your heart rate down maybe

00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,500
you're feeling a bit relaxed at least

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,260
you don't have to be on stage and you

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,080
can just be calm and listen to the rest

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,400
of the talk so that's one exercise you

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,740
can just do that and travel up

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,000
throughout your body down again can try

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,030
and challenge yourself and do like both

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,950
arms and both legs at once I'm still

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,710
down to just one leg in one home at a

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,170
time um there's another exercise but we

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,940
won't do but you can try if you're

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,940
feeling really stressed or anxious maybe

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,400
look within yourself and try and find

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,850
where that feeling is so a lot of people

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,680
if you're suffering some sort of poor

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,900
mental health symptoms if you're feeling

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,390
really anxious you might feel that in

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,920
your throat or your chest or wherever

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,440
we're all individuals are all different

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,540
so you might be feeling that somewhere

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,210
else so try and focus in on that feeling

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,930
and close your eyes and breathe never

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:45,240
forget to breathe and just like try and

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,220
visualize what it sounds sometimes it's

00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,590
really good to do it in pairs so you can

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,960
be explaining to someone what that

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:55,560
feeling looks like and how it feels and

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,330
just try and go inside the feeling so

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,150
i'll leave that up to you to whether or

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,580
not you want to try it so meditation is

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,730
a really good strategy for helping with

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,770
your self-care but how do we help other

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,470
people around us we can't meditate for

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,690
them so i hear there's some other things

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,920
that maybe you can if you're either

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,050
really juice or something you could try

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,090
and pray for them but there's some more

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,000
hands-on approaches don't actually

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,730
involve hands-on

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,810
at all so other people are like your

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:29,020
family your friends your co-workers team

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,510
members and things and some of the

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:36,040
things you can do has anyone heard of ru

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:38,200
ok day yep so as you might be able to

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,450
tell it's it's basically asking people

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,850
are you okay but it's a little more than

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,160
that so there's actually a website with

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,020
much more detailed instructions but if

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,300
you're going to ask someone are you like

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,040
are you okay in more than just a small

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,410
talk manner you've got to really listen

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,270
to them and then it's not just about

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,340
that one individual interaction it's

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,410
about following up making sure that

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,780
that's the same sometimes people won't

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,080
be okay and one of the best things you

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,310
can do is to be there and listen and

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,210
understand that maybe you don't

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:12,010
understand sometimes is very useful and

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,500
a really positive thing that I really

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,460
love and I've seen Katie do this several

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,820
times Thank You Katie um is saying thank

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,950
you and complimenting people so I want

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,850
to say thank you to Katie for thinking

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,160
me and being lovey all the time and

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:37,510
planning my hair how awesome of these

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:40,420
flaps I Kim your dues closer um so yeah

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,160
maybe take your time some time out of

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,570
today to thank someone if you've met

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,370
someone and they taught you something

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,800
you've never known before just be like

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,250
hey that was awesome thank you for

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,110
teaching me that um moving on to walk

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,510
workplaces because we all want to level

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,180
up our water cooler chat I don't know if

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:00,220
you all have water coolers but uh some

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,260
practical things for these spaces might

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,050
be if you're in a management position or

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,060
some sort of authority in the workplace

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,730
maybe you could organize a breakout

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,920
space so when people are feeling like a

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,600
little under the pressure feeling all

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,470
the pressure and stress maybe they can

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,819
go to a quiet room this I don't know how

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,740
I feel about this but a lot of people

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,420
find a lot of comfort in coloring books

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,850
so there's lots of adult coloring books

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,449
and it's just something totally kind of

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,730
mindless that you can do and focus on

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:32,210
something I do on a personal level is i

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,140
watch Korean

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,450
promise because I can totally just don't

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,039
have to care just watching this mindless

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,630
thing and at the end of the series I

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:47,029
feel like I accomplished nothing I

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:49,039
didn't but I finished so yeah just

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:52,760
having these sorts of things around can

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,770
be really helpful there's also activity

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,840
therapies so coloring is one of those

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,549
but you can have kind of group activity

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,490
therapies kind of like team building

00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,740
exercises but may be good for mental

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,620
health as well instead of trust

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,020
challenges um and the biggest thing

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,669
everyone can do and especially in my

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,600
places is have some empathy and

00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:16,429
understanding for the people around you

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,490
just doing that could really help some

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,529
people's job satisfaction and that

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,970
really helps retain good workers and

00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,220
produce good work like there is no

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,080
downside to caring about your workers

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,080
mental health because it's going to get

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,570
you a lot better results and being

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,860
self-employed doesn't change this being

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,409
a maintainer an open source project

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,330
doesn't change this you've got to look

00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:40,730
out for yourself as well and sometimes

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,130
we are our harshest critics so if you

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:47,140
are in charge of managing yourself maybe

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,789
make a nice activity for you to do

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,610
there's also kind of wider communities

00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,250
and I think the biggest thing we can do

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,620
with those is awareness and promoting

00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,690
the D stigmatization of this and there's

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,909
really some really great resources like

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,190
very developer focused there's prompt

00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:07,640
which is in this and initiative from the

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,649
Travis Foundation which is all about de

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,809
stigmatizing these and getting people to

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,610
talk about it more there's also some

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:16,940
great hashtags out there for anyone on

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,039
Twitter hashtag depressed get to a lot

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,690
there used to be a great website with

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,010
that as well but unfortunately it's

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:27,590
going down since i first wrote this talk

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:30,049
be it there's also like if you are a

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,260
particularly great like if you have lots

00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,240
of friends maybe talking to them and on

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,010
this level you're all my friends now I'm

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,570
talking to you all about mental health

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:44,809
so I hope you're like hey but technology

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,720
isn't all bad and this is what i really

00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,640
really want to talk about

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,330
there's tons of things that technology

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:55,020
is doing to help with mental health so

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:58,890
who here owns a smartphone Wow not

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,870
everyone that's really interesting so

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,960
there's lots of little apps to help you

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,340
manage your own mental health so there's

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,590
apps that have so many different

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,050
features there's panic buttons there's

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,390
journals and mood tracking there's

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,700
exercise tracking and some really cool

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,860
stuff that I'm excited about is the use

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,470
of different senses so there's a lot

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:23,070
more research coming out about how

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:24,660
different physiological responses can

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,750
indicate how where you are with your

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,570
mental health so one of these is heart

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:35,040
rate variability so some people with

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,020
bipolar disorder it can help if they're

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,390
different rates of the heart can help

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,630
track whether they might be about to go

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,200
into a downward swing and so the sensors

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:49,050
on our a lot of higher later models of

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,600
smartphones can track this and so they

00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,670
can find out if maybe they're about to

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,700
go on a downward turn which is really

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,520
cool there's a lot of indirect tools as

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,710
well so just the internet itself is

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,830
helping promote awareness increase

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,810
education and as you may have seen from

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,720
the talk before this one there's even

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,910
tools to help research mental health so

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,740
psycho pyar is helping with experiments

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,960
and that will be really helpful for

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,620
mental health and finding out more about

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,970
what we can do and what causes it and

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:25,320
yeah just generally how we can look

00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:27,570
after ourselves and yeah we can all talk

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,250
to each other on the Internet hopefully

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,310
so there are some great open spaces

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:36,090
where people can share stories and make

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,340
sure that no one feels alone so I hope

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,110
that's been really helpful and I hope

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,040
you can all keep talking to each other

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,710
about this be open about it and other

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,950
than go to the talk after afternoon tea

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,130
in this room I hope that's what you can

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,130
do and say thank you to each other

00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,130
thanks

00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,849
so before Russell or asks you for

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:15,739
questions if you don't have any

00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:19,389
questions we can play sleeping tie guns

00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:24,950
so just I just thought I'd like annoyed

00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:27,259

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,519
much ducky as a fantastic talk yeah if

00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:30,169
you if you're keen to play a game of

00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,369
sleeping Tigers I've never played

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:38,599
sleeping Tigers so yeah cool if there

00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:42,049
aren't any questions yeah my sleeping

00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,249
Tigers it is you can talk to you

00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:45,289
afterwards if you do you have any

00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:47,690
questions I do actually have a list of

00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,039
resources sort of for this talk this is

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,080
the second time I've written this talk

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,700
and say I have like a long list but

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,979
there they were on a different computer

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,859
and I didn't back them off but I I'll

00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:59,330
get them if you want them um sorry who

00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:04,039
here has played sleeping tigers or Lions

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:06,080
or ducks Wow so I'm gonna take you all

00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,279
back to primary school and then I'm

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,710
gonna take you in further back to

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,359
kindergarten so this is a great game

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,339
that I think teachers mostly like to

00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:17,809
play to make us quiet basically you all

00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,479
kind of get into a comfortable position

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,999
and pretend you're sleeping tiger so you

00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:28,239
don't move if you move you're out that's

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:30,769
that's the game and and I deeply

00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:32,740
contemplated just making this entire

00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:35,650
talk

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:40,059
because what better than to have a nap

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:41,530
time instead of talking about it sleep

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,610
is very important for mental health by

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,470
the way you don't get enough sleep

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:49,000
things get it you're gonna have a bad

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:55,270
time cool so do you guys wanna play

00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:00,700
