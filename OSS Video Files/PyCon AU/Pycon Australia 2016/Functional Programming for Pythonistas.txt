Rampant side effects. 
The shifting sands of mutable state beneath your feet.
Enter Functional Programming.
Functional Programming helps you write more clear, maintainable and testable code.                   
This talk will cover the core principles of functional programming, how they relate to techniques you probably already use, how to apply them in python, the benefits they can offer and how to introduce them to other developers.
