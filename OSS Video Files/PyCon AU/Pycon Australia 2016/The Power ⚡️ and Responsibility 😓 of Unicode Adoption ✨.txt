Communication is difficult.

Whether it’s between humans or machines or a combination of the two, trying to translate meaningful information is a lossy process.

Converting languages to use the new Unicode standard is hard, but once it's in place, you get this marvellous feature-add: Emoji compatibility. No longer do we have to make faces with symbols, or be forced to platform-specific emoticons! Rejoice in the extended character set!

Emoji has a rich history as a way to allow the communication of ideas in a reduced amount of data, and dates back to a time where this was important: SMS communications in Japan. However, as social networks feverishly try and clamber into this bandwagon, their implementations of the standard create more issues with miscommunication that aren't already possible with a 12x12 pictograph. 🤔

From the technical to the social aspects, mojibake and UTF-{8,16,32}, this talk will cover why the extended character set provided by the Unicode standard needs to be treated with responsibility by users and platforms alike.

This talk is not just an excuse to see what parts of the conference stack can’t handle Unicode, I promise. 😇

um okay so next up we have Katie

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,890
McLaughlin who is here to talk about

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,320
emotion she knows many different things

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,670
where's many different hats does

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,510
JavaScript Python PHP everything

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,189
basically she's pretty amazing and

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,580
according to this print out the name of

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,500
her talk is the power lightning bolt and

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:34,170
responsibility square of Unicode

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:37,890
adoption square is that right that's

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,730
right no okay cool okay so everyone

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,730
welcome Katie McLaughlin

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,110
hi I'm Katie and I really like emoji I

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,900
love how broken it is now TLD I only

00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,660
have half now because computers we have

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,700
Unicode unicode is extremely powerful

00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,070
for allowing us to communicate between

00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,130
nearly every written language that ever

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,680
has been and nearly every angle every

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,050
language that ever could be it means

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,610
that you can send things in whatever

00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,259
language whatever types that you want as

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,869
long as its defined under you decode

00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,910
there are a million different characters

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,509
that we can have under Unicode and we

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,400
can represent them using different

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,869
syntaxes this is for a 16-bit which i'll

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,390
be using a little bit throughout this

00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,190
talk but if we want to go full unicode

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,770
we need to define the 32-bit

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,759
representation which takes a text a

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:39,670
decimal characters so a let's start at

00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,140
the beginning a is represented with this

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,420
thing which just happens to be exactly

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,700
how its represented in ASCII which is

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,310
quite cool you can also represent the

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,290
Japanese are in Unicode using a

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,110
different code point we also have the

00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,479
option to combine certain code points we

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,000
can have II and we can have an accent

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,780
and then we can combine them to make and

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,020
eat with an accent and this works mostly

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,820
if I was to write up something in French

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,290
or in Russian with the specific

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,850
characters of those languages use and

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,890
send it to you if you're using Unicode

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,769
you should be able to receive it you may

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,850
not be able to read it and translate it

00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:20,590
into English but you should be able to

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,480
receive it by four byte the problem this

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,600
doesn't work for the Japanese not

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,560
Japanese the Japanese Unicode has

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,870
katakana kanji and hiragana but what it

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:37,660
doesn't have is emerging well it didn't

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,160
see back in the 90s the Japanese they

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,750
love their mobile phones they all had

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,660
this very close network sort of like how

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,250
AOL used to be and the engineers there

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,810
decided to use some of the extra space

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,959
and their character encodings to have

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,400
little pictures and this was cool Emma

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,830
that you could send a penguin or a

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,870
picture of a horse to your friends the

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,370
network's didn't exactly agree on what

00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,959
picture should be in which code which

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,330
meant that sometimes you would send an

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,660
apple and you'd get out of penguin but

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,450
that's completely fine they fixed it so

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,760
Apple comes along about two thousand and

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,489
seven or so they want to release iOS two

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,930
or three in Japan and the Japanese go

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,530
well you're going to add emoji right

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,690
because this is part of our culture so

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,200
together with some work that Google was

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,300
doing and the Unicode consortium which

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,440
is an absolutely magnificent term for a

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,170
group of people that deal with

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,569
linguistics they developed and help

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,680
implement the Unicode six tender which

00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,900
included emoji and they put it into iOS

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,250
two for the japanese market only and the

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,590
japanese were happy they bought the

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:47,319
iphone and that's fine and then iOS 5

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,450
happened and iOS 5 had this little

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,900
hidden feature which included the emoji

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,040
keyboard for everyone else including the

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,780
United States and nothing happened until

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,040
one day allegedly somebody was playing

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,430
around on the settings on their phone

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,060
and when huh I can send a picture of

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,010
poop to my friends and so they sent the

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,019
picture and their Franklin hey how'd you

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,300
do that and story goes that a just

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,489
spread like wildfire which is why people

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,640
think that Apple invented emoji but they

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,680
didn't since it's 2010 this is a couple

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,390
of years ago now so you may recognize

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,640
some of these particular characters like

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,960
the Apple and the penguin and such but

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,400
there have been multiple versions of

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,599
Unicode that have been released since

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,630
then these are all standard emoji

00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:38,680
characters including chipmunk the

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,539
compression from earlier volkan son also

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,080
known as our fingers middle fingers

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,860
blade and you also have the last symbol

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,430
there which is our men in

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:56,389
suit levitating who remembers windings

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:58,099
that's why when windings and web Dean's

00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,750
are now in the unicode standard which

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:02,419
means that any character you used to be

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:06,620
able to type in these fonts is now in

00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,539
unicode anyone remember using say

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,419
microsoft offers and getting a capital j

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:16,009
in the middle of their emails that's

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,780
wingdings for smiley face that's why we

00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,120
need it to have backwards compatibility

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,229
and that's why you give businessman

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,020
inlets so in many businesses levitating

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:30,139
tol last year we had a whole bunch more

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,620
emoji including the lion face and tacos

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:39,800
because tacos and also the Australian

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:41,360
smiling and the one on the end here is

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,650
quite interesting because you'll notice

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,560
it it's in a slightly different color

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,210
last year we got Fitzpatrick modifiers

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,400
which allows you to have the six

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,800
different Fitzpatrick scale of human

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,319
skin tone colors the way this is

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,289
implemented is you have the character

00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,300
for the rock on because of course that's

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:04,219
now an emoji but you also have a color

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,159
when you combine them together this

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:09,229
makes the one image and this is really

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:13,250
cool because it means you can send an

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:16,129
emoji that looks like you so this is

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,240
Pike on let's talk about snakes snake

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:22,520
snake in Python 3 we can use unicode

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,300
data as part of the standard library and

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,580
take any emoji character and return what

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,270
it actually means so input your new code

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,069
data Unicode a debate snack is snake you

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,930
can also go the other way around you can

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,360
use an escape sequence with the slash

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,819
capital n to be able to work out what

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,339
the emoji is escape sequences good for

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,550
Unicode and gravitational fields there

00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,550
you go

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:54,710
science jokes this is all in Python 3.3

00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,749
and onwards you can also use the Dakota

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,119
escapes you can translate it into the

00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,800
slash capital u as we saw earlier and

00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:03,289
you can also translate it back again

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,759
just using a normal escape sequence this

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,879
is all Python through this will not work

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:20,719
in Python to use Python 3 it works with

00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:24,289
emoji so this all works fine but there

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:27,199
are some issues with emoji I posit that

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,909
because of the speed of Unicode adoption

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,919
that had to happen especially on Android

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:34,219
platforms that the implementations were

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,569
a bit rushed now Apple had all the time

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,550
in the world to set up and get the

00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,620
standard which is why all the emoji you

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,789
see are normally the Apple or

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,959
international standard of emoji Android

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:48,770
trying to keep up with Apple as they do

00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:52,399
how to implement emoji very quickly this

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,879
is a yellow heart it is yellow say it

00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,459
with me yellow yellow the image on the

00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:02,120
left here is how it's defined in the

00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:05,899
Unicode standard this patching is the

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,219
same hatching is used on English Harold

00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,800
E shields and it's supposed to represent

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:12,199
gold different stripes me in different

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,509
colors so you can have red and green and

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,430
blue because the documentation standards

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:21,309
of the medieval times didn't really have

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:24,999
a lot of colors this is yellow yellow

00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,999
android 4.4

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,660
so you can see the kind of problems

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,870
we're going to have if you're trying to

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,350
send an emoji from apple into android

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,460
there's a little bit of miscommunication

00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:50,300
involved there and you can see how this

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:53,850
could get a bit hairy it gets better

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,960
this is flushed face now this is the

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,790
Apple emoji one Twitter and Android

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,400
implementations of flushed face the

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,440
first three look like it's like I've

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,990
done something wrong the last one looks

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,880
like I'm doing nah and taking credit for

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,750
something i used to use the last one a

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:18,060
lot until I realized how it was being

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:21,860
misinterpreted this one this is supposed

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:29,310
to be hugging this is what I see

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:32,790
microservices I'm used to something like

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,590
this this is what ice used to use is

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,200
homing because i used to use msn

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,640
messenger who remembers msn messenger

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,960
yeah that's the second microsoft

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,400
reference that I haven't been booed off

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,660
stage I love this community we also have

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,070
clapping now you've done this a few

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,230
times already however if you've noticed

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,470
you put your palm and your other pump

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:55,209
together the one on the end is windows

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:00,100
have you ever tried to claw

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,779
with your thumbs facing and there if you

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,470
have rings and really strong knuckles it

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:09,220
starts to hurt out for a while Oh

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:11,019
Microsoft yeah Oh can anyone take a

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,759
guess what this about this is the same

00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,110
emoji across different platforms anyone

00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,110
have want to have a guess at what it is

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:26,230
blonde so what exactly is going on

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,470
different platforms just want to put

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,119
things in different ways sorry facebook

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,939
but the one on the end there is what you

00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:38,050
used to have for ? it is fixed now

00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,970
mostly because you did your whole

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,889
rebranding which I'll mention later but

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,240
you can still use this in certain parts

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,689
of Facebook you might want to fix that

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,100
come talk to me afterwards and I'll help

00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:49,839
there has also been entire scientific

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,069
papers on this which is great because I

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,740
thought this was a thing and it's been

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:55,509
science um the new University of

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,009
Minnesota has released a paper are

00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:00,160
blissfully happy or ready to fight

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:01,869
various interpretations of emoji the one

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,910
on the left is grinning the one on the

00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:06,850
right is grimace the only difference is

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:11,290
the eyes if you were to get one of those

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,209
you have no idea what they meant so

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,459
that's all the problems how do we get

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:17,259
new emoji into this thing well there are

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,299
things that you can do you can anyone

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,220
the public can submit to the Unicode

00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,139
consortium and submit a proposal for a

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,540
new emoji things that will get you

00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,449
accepted backwards compatibility like

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,059
with our levitating man earlier there is

00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:33,129
now a cowboy emoji because yahoo

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:36,040
messenger has cowboy and that wasn't

00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,799
previously in the standard also if it

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,660
completes a set one version a unicode

00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,309
didn't have the complete zodiac set yeah

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,720
also if lots of people just request it

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,619
anyway and that's how we get tacos

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,779
because tacos things that won't get you

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:54,970
accept it if it's overly specific so we

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,860
already have a glass of wine a martini

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,389
and a tropical fruit drinks so

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,360
manhattan's aren't coming into the

00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:03,279
standard anytime soon also you're never

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
ever ever supposed to have any logos or

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,990
brands ever ever so there's no way that

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,740
you can tell that this is all Apple ever

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,910
absolutely no way

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:16,540
that you can tell that this is Apple

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:19,570
right yeah also no fads or means Vulcan

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,220
sign anyone and the thing is when we get

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,500
all these new emoji coming out there's

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,360
issues with backwards compatibility has

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,140
anyone seen the sign outside on the door

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,270
when they came in that just worked that

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,610
may not have worked Richard said it

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:37,750
wouldn't but sometimes you end up seeing

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,029
characters like this what you're seeing

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,589
here is you're seeing older versions of

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,990
systems that don't have the new unicode

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,970
characters so in my abstract on the

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,330
website there is a thinking face if

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:53,290
you're using Android 5 or if you're

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:56,589
using Yosemite OS X Yosemite you will

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,209
see your box now there are ways to get

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:00,070
around this what you do is you update

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,750
your operating system you get new emoji

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,440
and you know just some security updates

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,209
and stuff but new emoji yeah the one

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,149
place where this has to work though is

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:13,839
URLs because you can't just have the

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:17,140
entire world with URLs using just Latin

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:23,260
characters an emoji works here this is a

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:24,940
valid website spend WS is a ballad

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,600
website that I have registered and a

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,310
detailed spoon theory spoon theory is

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,230
extremely important if you would like to

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,089
know more go to this website the way

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,860
that you're able to do this is with an

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,140
RFC that's actually quite old now it's

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,170
like over a decade old what it defines

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,940
is puny puny code encoding you can do

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,000
this in Python 3 where you can import

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,070
encoding s dot idna and you can

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,380
translate emoji or any unicode

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,680
characters into a code and it's

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,480
reversible it looks a bit weird but the

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
codes are all there there's JavaScript

00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,720
and plantations as Python

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,940
implementations I don't have time to go

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,670
into the algorithm now however how do

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,570
you actually enter that spoon how do you

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,730
type in your characters normally on your

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,800
mobile you have say a little smiley face

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,680
underneath your Enter key such as with

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,010
swype and SwiftKey a lot of the vendors

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,529
now have this is native as well on OSX

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,910
you can use a combination of command

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:25,300
option and space

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,190
to bring up a emoji searchable option

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,110
which also allows you to do full-text

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,820
searching which means you can type in

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,500
seven and you can get the Roman numeral

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:37,660
seven which is fun you can also there's

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,550
now our Kenneth rights has developed en

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,730
keyboard which allows you to use the

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,500
proper names for the emoji in your

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,330
console and it'll copy the emoji to your

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,860
clipboard so you can get sparkles cake

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:53,560
sparkles really easily or if you don't

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,570
want to have to have CL eyes or whatever

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,020
you could just make an entire emoji

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,870
keyboard this is a project by Tom Scott

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,000
who connected together 14 mechanical

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,880
keyboards a little bit of lua and

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,960
autohotkey to be able to have one button

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:15,760
for each emoji and it's this big table

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,560
worth of keyboard it works the code I've

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,480
got the code if you're interested in Lua

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,420
scripting and stuff and this is also the

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,690
same person behind emotionally and emoji

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,540
only network your usernames had to be

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,680
emoji so you can imagine how well that

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,010
did they they had venture capitalists

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,920
wanting to give the money there you go

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:41,800
on the web so on the web is a bit of an

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,710
interesting beast do you use a slack and

00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,440
github you might be familiar with short

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,710
codes this is a picture of cake to get

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,600
cake on slack on github you use colons

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:58,150
and then the word that you want and you

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,740
get cake but on HipChat if you want cake

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,490
you know yours colon to use brackets

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,320
braces the curly bits um and it comes up

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,630
with a different type of cake because

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,210
cake does an equal cake and I'm sorry

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:13,300
but these aren't emoji these are

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,790
emoticons or picture glyphs they're not

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,850
emoji party parrot is not an emoji I'm

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,440
sorry but these different systems have

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,230
so many different customizations and

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,040
they don't go across platforms so things

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,630
aren't emoji sorry also if you have any

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,520
say in implementing any of these systems

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,520
please allow me to disable auto correct

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,360
because I don't know how many different

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,600
systems where a simple smiley will make

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,020
my mood just increasingly elevated and

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,090
happiness or take what I interpret as an

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,890
embarrassed face and turn into money

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:53,710
mouth which is now an emoji and but

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,840
who's a web developer yay speaking to

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,640
people who can fix this stuff if you're

00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,560
developing for the web and you want to

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,970
be able to read these things back to

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,250
your users you have absolute complete

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,410
control you do not have to let the

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,319
system decide how things are represented

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:12,490
for you if I can make a suggestion just

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,500
one use full images do not rely on the

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,449
operating systems implementations of

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,100
emoji because you're going to have all

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,540
the different variations of all the

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,339
different operating systems you're going

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,350
to have the missing glyphs depending on

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,030
which version you're using and don't try

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,400
to get around this by using user agents

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,320
and stuff it just won't work so the next

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,450
slide is the only slide in this talk

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,520
that has actual emoji the rest have been

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:40,180
images I'm running elk at and it doesn't

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,250
work two of the images up the top there

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,040
don't actually represent as emoji their

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,780
text I have to add an extra character on

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,360
to the end to say give me the emoji

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,530
representation for these to work and the

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,630
one on the end of supposed to be a kiwi

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,480
fruit but El Cap doesn't have the latest

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,580
unicode standard so it doesn't work you

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,430
should use for back images some of this

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,280
has been done for you with oh gosh how I

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,740
pronounce this to emoji to emoji is

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,540
there you go wordpress com use is this

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,970
what it does is when you render your

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,560
page at the JavaScript will find all the

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,960
emoji characters and replace them with

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:19,600
images this is great they do it with on

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,910
the Twitter website on WordPress in and

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,980
a few other places and this mostly works

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,460
at least gets around when you don't have

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:32,080
the characters locally but we can raise

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:38,679
the bar here yes raising bark

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:42,730
ah okay i'll text also known as

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,100
highlights when you when you copy an

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,440
image when you drag and select and copy

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,200
an image the old text at one is what

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,059
goes into your clipboard you can also

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,130
have the mouse overs or the tooltips

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,590
which if you mouse over an image it will

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,929
have a title text and if you combine

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,730
this with web accessibility you can have

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,820
a very good implementation that would

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,620
allow you to fall back to a version of

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:09,070
emoji that will actually work for most

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,380
users this is an example this is the

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,019
tumbler glass or whiskey emoji which is

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,250
now an emoji and this is what I think

00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,860
you should be doing if you're trying to

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,620
use emoji on your websites you use your

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,230
fallback image you have alt text as the

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,130
character you have the title text and

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,139
you also have the Aria label as well so

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,769
you combine all this together and you're

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:34,179
able to get a emoji you can mouse over

00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:36,010
it see what it's supposed to represent

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,649
so you get rid of the issues with

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,630
grinning face first grimacing you can

00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,210
copy and paste it so inline images are

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,659
copied as unicode text and you also have

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,919
the compatibility for screen readers

00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:51,220
conference driven development what's

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,669
that emoji for kate is installable from

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,620
the pi PI package repository and it is a

00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:00,039
runnable module in Python 3 and there's

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,740
also a Django tag template module which

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:07,620
will do all this for you I released it

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,120
about five days ago now so get on that

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,799
also if you're going to be using our

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,990
website just to make sure you have your

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,700
meta charset set to utf-8 because

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,549
otherwise you get a whole lot load more

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,519
problems if you're using jQuery or any

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:22,779
sort of templating languages up this is

00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,919
normally done for you but if you're

00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:28,690
doing base HTML just add this so the

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,169
future of the moji guess what we're

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,370
getting we're getting new emoji actually

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,649
we just got it a couple of weeks ago

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,289
because unico 9 is just dropped which

00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:42,429
means we now have such timeless classics

00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:45,039
as facepalm and shrug cowboy we also

00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,580
have an egg we used to have chickens oh

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,780
no no

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,780
what came first was there duck an owl

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,270
and there's some sort of sports thing

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,770
happening in South America so there's a

00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,530
whole lot of emoji to do with that as

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:04,720
well there is now water polo emoji

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:07,780
because the Olympics there are also some

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,730
place there are some place holders

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,970
already the next year's emoji said

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:17,410
including the Stephen Colbert face

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:19,270
allegedly these are still a work in

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,570
progress do not implement any of these

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,510
yet we've also had in the last couple of

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,850
weeks a whole bunch of updates happening

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,310
so in Android the flushing face from

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,960
before is changing I don't know whether

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,820
the last one is supposed to be a duck

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:40,330
face but this is all the same character

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:42,490
on Android 56 and the new new girl one

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:49,330
which hasn't been released yet Facebook

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:51,340
have also updated their emoji let's take

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:56,440
all the images and let's point them that

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:58,270
way windows are the anniversary edition

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,060
of Windows 10 now has new emoji which

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,160
fixes a lot of the issues they had they

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,610
actually look quite nice now that's kind

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,050
of cool iOS 10 beta has also been

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,640
released they don't have the new merger

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,230
yet but what they have done is fix the

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,850
darn grinning face so it actually looks

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:17,950
grinning so that's great um but you

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,360
don't need to update operating systems

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,700
to get the new emoji there are some

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,880
vendors that will do it for you such as

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,890
with zero with joiners there is a

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,860
proposal that's just been accepted that

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,740
was put in from the Google people in the

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,630
consortium that defines a whole bunch of

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,720
combinations of existing characters into

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:40,870
new ones such as if you combine the

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,810
white flag and the rainbow emoji you get

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,240
a rainbow flag this has been implemented

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,890
on Twitter web it is also an iOS betta

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,100
it's hiding around near where the other

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:54,430
flags are or the keyboard but this is

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,580
great what's also been added is gender

00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,049
modifiers finally I can be a policewoman

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,779
if I want to now

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:04,480
previously these were all men gendered

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:06,039
only which means I can be a policeman I

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,379
can be a construction worker I can be a

00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,749
golfer that's great and it also goes the

00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:13,029
other way these were all previously

00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:14,649
female representations only and you had

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:16,059
no way to change it so means you can

00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:17,470
send that you're getting a haircut or a

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,899
face massage if you're a guy and that's

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,529
great and I think that's really cool

00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:26,739
these are all images based from emoji

00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:29,739
PDF which is a thing and it's awesome so

00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:31,210
like Wikipedia except for emoji I don't

00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:32,710
have access to any of the app and stuff

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:38,379
yet so i'm going based on what they're

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:40,749
reporting so some takeaways there is a

00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:43,059
lot of power and speech and emoji allow

00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:45,609
us an additional layer of communication

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,470
but we still need to implement and think

00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:49,179
about what we're sending people because

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,399
they just prone to misinterpretations

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:53,470
but just have a little fun with them

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:56,799
there's nothing wrong with just having a

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,409
smiley face in things and sparkles

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,009
sparkles are great and that's why I had

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:02,009
thank you very much

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,590
Thank You Katie so we have five or six

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:20,300
minutes for questions so if you would

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:30,190
like to form a oddly line questions come

00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:34,280
on Russell alright so I'm I'm old my old

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:35,840
boy and even though I've got

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,640
twenty-twenty vision one of my biggest

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,290
problems with emoji is that someone

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,940
sends me grimace someone sends me happy

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,380
face and I end up squinting on this

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,900
little tiny screen trying to work out

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,710
what's going on does either the emoji

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:51,080
consortium or any idea merging cancer

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:55,790
Unicode consortium that's all they do

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:58,130
right no do they have any guidelines or

00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,620
suggestions for how big these damn

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,240
things can be so that you can see what

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,900
they are are you talking about mobile or

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,600
web any all of the above so I don't

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,130
believe they do because most of what

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,020
they do is dictate exactly what

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,200
characters go where as opposed to the

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,650
implementations they have retrofitted a

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,770
lot of their documents to reflect what

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,690
vendors have done now a lot of the emoji

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,470
that I used in this talk from Apple were

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,240
really small versions because apples

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,680
lifts really tiny but they were

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,800
implementing what the Japanese Habra's

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:38,270
only 12 x 12 or 16 by 16 anyway how to

00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:40,370
fix that I would love it if on mobile

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,490
natively if you were to click and hold

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,580
on emoji you would pop it up say I

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,960
believe some browsers do that now with

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,960
title text on images i know that if i

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,030
press and hold on XKCD door show me the

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,470
cool old text maybe if they could have

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,340
that implemented as standard that would

00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:00,740
make it so it's like the the people like

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,240
you with our perfect vision can see the

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,750
bigger ones that would be cool but they

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,840
don't define anything Thanks oh there's

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,970
more people there's more people color so

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,340
you talked about the the color modifiers

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,160
which can be applied to presumably any

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,350
glyph is that kind of the model I know

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,210
so the color modifiers are just the six

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,770
major colors of the human skin spectrum

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,410
and they're only applied to human

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,800
related a motor

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:28,140
so the snowboarder the surfer the other

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,330
hands all the faces it doesn't allow you

00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,270
to change the colors of just any emoji

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,160
so what's the deal with colors for

00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,560
emojis in general are they whatever the

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,270
artist thinks on the day I mean what

00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,490
what do you mean so all of your examples

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,830
here in pretty colors you have yellow

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,660
hearts and purple heart to hear on them

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:50,820
and stuff I mean what's what so what I

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,170
guess what I'm getting at is it seems to

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,340
me this is a bit of mission creep like

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,570
when you're rendering glyphs for natural

00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,610
languages English or Japanese or

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,040
whatever you often have some other

00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,140
mechanism for defining the colors if

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,820
it's a web page it'll be CSS it says

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,800
this is my foreground colors my

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,480
background color he's my text in those

00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,980
foreground and background colors and

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,920
suddenly there's an emoji in the middle

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,900
of your text stream what if that doesn't

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,220
you know it's specifying its own color

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,320
how does that work with all the other

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:25,950
colors going on on your web page so it

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,080
doesn't I there was a proposal to have

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,510
CSS modifiers that would interact with

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,760
emoji but at the moment CSS does not

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,580
interact with emoji in respect to colors

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,320
and apart from the Fitzpatrick modifiers

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,540
there's no way to modify a color of an

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,080
emoji right so you could imagine a case

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,090
where let's an emoji might be very hard

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,860
to see if you accidentally well if

00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,930
you're the background of your web page

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,730
sort of was a very close color let's say

00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,620
some reason the background was yellow

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,730
and then you put a yellow emoji on top I

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,840
would be more worried why your

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,670
background is yellow sure but yeah but

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,900
that that's that's kind of a separate

00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,580
discussion there might be a good reason

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,600
for an alert box or something who knows

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:11,400
anyway that it just seemed like a bit of

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,680
mission creep to me that's all anyway hi

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,320
Katie thanks for a very entertaining

00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,500
talk I'm interested if you have any

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,780
comment about a kind of web fonts and

00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,170
things like font awesome which seemed to

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,910
me kind of almost a you know augment

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,250
emoji so that you can kind of have any

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:32,550
kind of little icons that you know

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,650
aren't part of emoji ok so we're font

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,020
awesome comes into

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:39,040
is more like how endings and web dings

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:42,040
used to work where you could have

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,150
stylized specific things and it was I

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,310
was under the impression it was more of

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,780
a case for performance as opposed to

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,430
having all the little images everywhere

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,040
and because it's a fun it can scale

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:55,990
really well just like the alternative

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,990
would be to use just individual SVG's

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,480
yeah I mean fun awesome has its place

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,610
but this is fun awesome you have to have

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,380
the font on your system or import into

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,570
your web page for it to work these are

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,700
universal hence why it's Universal

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:15,830
encoding thanks for a very cool talk

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,190
what's your experience been like with a

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:22,040
browser support for I our eyes and that

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,170
you've got spoon WS and does that work

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,450
across all of the different browsers yes

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:30,620
because when you have the puny coding

00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:32,690
coding the X n hyphen hyphen 9f nine and

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,330
or whatever it was you can type that in

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,000
and you can go to the website and it'll

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,380
either resolve it in your url bar as the

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,210
emoji because they'll work it out or

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,280
I'll have it as the puny code thing and

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,830
that will work in all browsers which is

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,840
why you have the Latin conversion I've

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,300
not seen a browser that doesn't work

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,660
with that but I haven't used links and

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,340
tried to do all the edge cases for that

00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:00,170
what about with confusable things like

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,090
google com division sign com that sort

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,090
of thing roses security issues for

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,680
people that see the link and they see

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,390
the division sign and think it's a slash

00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,230
they think it's a link to google com

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:17,000
have you seen any issues with this sort

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:19,040
of thing um there is stuff in that RFC

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,650
about confusable characters one of the

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,310
examples they use as an eye that doesn't

00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:27,560
have the dot there's a whole bunch of

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,180
security and stuff related to this and I

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,440
don't nearly have enough time to include

00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,090
in this talk but if you want to grab me

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,120
later I can point you to the different

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,850
references and stuff thank you very much

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,440
Katie so we've got ten minutes until

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,110
next session so everyone give her a

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,170
round of applause

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,170
