Title: Fail Early, Fail Often, Fail Well

It happens. Things go south and it’s not even clear how. Your client and you can’t see eye to eye, or your enthusiastic new business partner has dropped off the radar. The project you’ve invested weeks, months, or years into may never see the light of day.

Failure comes in many forms and the increasing complexity of our projects and the world they operate in doesn’t help. Despite our best efforts, learning the hard way is often the only way. Perhaps this is why modern startup culture has rallied around the mantra: “Fail fast. Fail early. Fail often.” But I spent the better part of my career failing in freelance, agency, and startups, and the experience leads me to believe the common refrain to be lacking.

Like gymnasts who train to fall properly, I believe we must learn to fail well. In this talk, I draw from my experience learning the hard way, flagging the ten easiest and most insidious mistakes one can make. Because failure is inevitable, I will also be sharing a framework for recovery that includes managing yourself, your relationships, and your reputation.

Attendees will leave with a better sense of what NOT to do, an idea of how to cope with failure, and the knowledge that failure is inevitable and that’s OK.

okay good afternoon everybody welcome

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,290
back from lunch thank you for tuning to

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,690
the afternoon session first up we have

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,059
Josh Simmons I was a community organizer

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,469
and web developer currently serving as a

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,179
board member for the Open Source

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,859
Initiative and a program manager with

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,260
Google for the open source program

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,750
selfish this is a second talk today

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,150
which is a feat that I I can't even

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,800
imagine how he replicates so take a

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,800
right Josh thank you for the cursor

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,700
excellent excellent thank you all for

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,250
coming suffice it to say I have failed a

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,920
lot in a very short time span in my

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,050
career probably in more ways than you

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,140
can imagine I've failed as a freelancer

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,309
as a virtual agency as a start-up owner

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,340
and as an employee at least a few times

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:55,469
so with this experience I have learned

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,390
some lessons that I would like to pass

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,149
on my goal with this talk is to help you

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,730
as an individual fail well you know like

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,700
gymnasts who learn to fall we should

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,450
learn to fail so that the failure in the

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,619
recovery is less painful for everybody

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,229
specifically we'll go over types of

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,780
failure things to avoid we're move on

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,090
then to show a framework for thinking

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,280
through recovering from failure because

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,670
failure large and small it's it's

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,580
inevitable now a little housekeeping

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,560
here I've worn many hats I still wear

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,450
quite a few today i'm wearing the hat of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,659
Joshua Simmons the individual the

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,990
community organizer etc etc nothing I

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,439
say represents current past future

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,210
employers my slides sadly will not be

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,130
available online Thank You corporate

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,079
overlords but the video will be

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,390
available and frankly the slides are

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,000
mostly a foil for conversation more than

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,479
anything else I'm always happy to take

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,969
questions and I'm very very easy to find

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:03,240
online so you are always welcome to

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:06,450
reach out ok we here are presumably all

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,280
fans of open source so I do not need to

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,940
convince you of the value of sharing in

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,360
the comments but sharing about failure

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,570
is hard

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,600
though it's important we strive not to

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,730
make the same mistake twice so why

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,890
should we keep our failures privates

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,370
when we can help other people not make

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,980
the same mistake as well it can also be

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,250
unhealthy to keep failures private and

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,960
be very closed closed about them it can

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,520
be unhealthy to bottle that stress up

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,320
and have the anxiety about oh my

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,870
goodness people might learn that I

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,580
failed we're all human failures happen

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,610
and the more we share with each other

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,250
what we are failures the met the faster

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,440
we'll all evolved so my goal is to help

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,390
you avoid failure and navigate recovery

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,170
but also to make everybody a little more

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,280
comfortable talking about failure this

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,780
is one of my favorite quotes about

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,620
failure please please when you fail

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,020
whether it's small or large share it so

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,780
let me set the scene a little bit this

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,870
is me in 2011 going whitewater rafting

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,600
and look I had white water raft once

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,670
once before this is me at the end of a

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,470
two-day run deciding you know I haven't

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,300
taken a spill on the drink yet so why

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,030
don't I hop on an inflatable kayak and

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,290
take on a class-4 rapid anyone who's

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,110
done whitewater rafting knows that's

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,260
that's not a great idea but that's what

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,030
I did the reason I'm setting the scene

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,720
with whitewater rafting is that it's a

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,730
personal experience that when you fall

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,890
out of the raft it can feel a lot like

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,810
you're going to die but you probably

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,320
won't and there are things that you can

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,260
do to lower the probability of having

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,840
serious injury or death you know when

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,510
you fall out you look for strainers

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,250
right you see brambles and trees and

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,110
whatnot in the river and you try to

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,040
navigate around those because if you get

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,720
caught in them and you've got this

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,260
current pushing on you you can be pushed

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,740
under similarly you don't you want to

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,360
flip horizontally in the water rather

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,890
than vertically because if you flip

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,870
vertically you can get your feet caught

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,380
in the rocks beneath again pulled under

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,440
etc there are a lot of little tips like

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,290
these and most of them came in handy

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,250
because as you see I fell in the drink

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,030
and now that

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:35,350
really helped me come out with no more

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,050
than just a few bruises so again what's

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,420
the point of this it's that failure can

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,320
feel like the end failure you can feel

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,810
larger than life but it's not it happens

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,490
and it serves us well to keep it in

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,380
context so less exposition let's just

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,660
dive right in this is my top 10 list

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,410
David Letterman style of things not to

00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,150
do failures to avoid no no two failures

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,220
are the same so I can't give you a

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,980
script for avoiding failures but what i

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,030
can do is i can show you the types of

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,070
failures that i encountered and make it

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,290
easier for you to see them coming make

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,520
it your risk or even just recognize what

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:21,490
happened when you do a post-mortem so

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,640
for the fun part number ten do not lose

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,550
touch with people you're you want to

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,470
stay in stay top of mind with clients

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,229
coworkers and the communities that you

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,600
running most jobs are not advertised

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,700
most opportunities are not advertised

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,460
and a lot of the learning that we get is

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:44,919
from the humans around us and in context

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,450
of contract work because that is where I

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,610
have the most experience with context of

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,720
contract work the shortest path the

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,590
money is through clients that you

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,740
already have so stay in touch with the

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,930
people that you know there are a lot of

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,540
ways to stay in touch attend events

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,520
preaching to the choir here share

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,770
relevant news with people if you see an

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,440
item of news that is relevant to

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,530
somebody whether that's a new tool new

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,030
technique or just something totally

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,350
unrelated to your work if it reminds you

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,880
of them send it to them they'll

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,440
appreciate that you were thinking of

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,650
them and are continuing to provide value

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,350
for them if it's not creepy depending on

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,169
your relationship send them a happy

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,080
birthday know or a gift on the holidays

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,120
a one thing that people do increasingly

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,669
to stay top of mind they write a blog

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,110
and you can easily attach a newsletter

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,610
functionality to that blog so that

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,130
you're continually providing useful

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,020
information to not just your former

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,580
clients but also your peer professional

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,050
because we're all an expert in something

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:50,039
and we can all continue learning from

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:53,620
one another one thing that that I did

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,990
well I lost touch with people what i did

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,659
is i expanded my network far too

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,849
aggressively I'm a social person it's an

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,490
easy thing to do i also have trouble

00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,139
saying no we'll get to that later and so

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,460
what i would do is i would build all

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,259
these connections and make all these

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,419
promises and i would drop the ball again

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,400
and again and again and so what I left

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,199
in my wake was a network of people who

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,630
basically didn't trust me and no longer

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,099
heard from me right so if you can't

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,729
sustain the network that you already

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:24,009
have then focus on your network rather

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,360
than growing it aggressively and only

00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:29,470
grow it when you're actually able to

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,229
maintain those connections number 9 do

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,849
not put all your eggs in one basket now

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,490
there are many baskets out there right

00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,740
this could be a skill set this could be

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,690
a marketing channel in terms of

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,759
marketing I think the easiest example

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,680
that comes to mind for me is all the

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,560
businesses that flock to Facebook to

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,150
build Facebook pages with the hopes of

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,909
oh I've got free marketing free access

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,909
to an audience well because social

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:58,569
networks grow and the reach decreases as

00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:00,759
they grow a lot of people their bottom

00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,870
lines hurt because they decided well I'm

00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,099
gonna have a Facebook page I'm not going

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,680
to have a website because who needs to

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,000
pay a developer for that when they put

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
all their eggs in one basket and

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,150
marketing channels suddenly that

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,810
marketing channel goes away or is

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:16,800
diminished that hurts them for us as

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:20,380
developers or developer adjacent people

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,560
this means growing our skill sets right

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,509
there's the the idea of being t-shaped

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,240
right it's very good to have a lot of

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,520
skills in terms of knowing what's

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,010
adjacent to the work you do so that you

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,349
can pitch yourself in different ways in

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,270
different contexts but still actually

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,099
being very focused on a particular set

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,930
of skills that you are truly an expert

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:45,760
at how I failed oh the mini failures

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,490
here but the one I'm going to share with

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,600
you is I had as a independent contractor

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,550
as an owner of a virtual agency I had

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,450
too few clients

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,610
and two of them were far responsible for

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,360
far too much of our revenue right so

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,730
when one of them went south okay that

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,459
hurts but maybe we can make that up then

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,019
went two of them went self suddenly we

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:14,140
couldn't pay the bills I couldn't pay my

00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,120
contractors and so that business

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:21,370
collapsed because I had too much

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,779
invested in too few clients so moving on

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,760
from that actually before I move on from

00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,050
that in terms of if you're not an

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,839
independent contractor if you're an

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,329
employee somewhere it's helpful to have

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,339
ends at many different companies right

00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,839
we don't live in an era when you're

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,329
going to be with the same employer for

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,700
your entire life let's not pretend that

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,350
we are loyal T is great but the job

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,700
market is what it is and sometimes we

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,350
get bored yeah let's be honest and so

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,209
having in that many companies and

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,459
keeping those connections alive means

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,410
that when you are looking for something

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,060
else you'll know who to look for you

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,230
know who to talk to and they'll know

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,630
that hey when they're looking for a

00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,770
certain type of person you might bid the

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,870
person for the job and they'll let you

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:07,899
know number 8 do not work yourself out

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,339
of a job as a freelancer this is this

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,779
one is actually very much just for

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,930
freelancers and independent contractors

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,750
as a freelancer you're always looking

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,730
for work right we don't really get into

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,410
the into the business because we see

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,000
ourselves and sales people or marketers

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,300
or what have you we get into it because

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
we love the craft we love the skill but

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,329
if you're going to work for yourself you

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,950
have to be a marketer in a salesperson

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:33,420
an administrator and all of these things

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,420
that come with being self-employed

00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,699
what's really tempting to do is to get a

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,370
project that you love and to sink your

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:44,770
teeth into it and to forget everything

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,850
else right because that's why you're

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,959
doing the job because you love the work

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,790
but what happens when you finish that

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,390
project and you send that invoice and

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,980
you realize okay I've got this this this

00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,510
payment coming I was going to say check

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,360
but I don't I don't think that's a thing

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,180
here you know if you don't know where

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
that next project is coming from well a

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,580
sales cycle takes time right you're not

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,680
going to be able to get clients like

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,140
that necessarily so it's really helpful

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,710
to be familiar with the concept of a

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,390
sales funnel and sales cycles knowing

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,400
that there are certain stages of a

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,440
relationship with with a client or a

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,600
lead knowing how long it takes for you

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,090
to turn that lead into into a client who

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,130
pays keeping things things in mind will

00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:33,350
help you balance the work between

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:37,430
balance of work between do crafted

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,230
crafting and selling now I'm just going

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,140
to move a little quicker because I

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,130
realize that this is a shorter time slot

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,600
than usual do not be an island again

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,330
preaching to the choir participate in

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,470
communities online and off this is again

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:57,820
the best way to find work don't do

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,290
everything when you work for yourself or

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,910
even if you don't it's tempting to do

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,130
all of the things that are adjacent to

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,500
the work you're doing it is painful

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,540
sometimes to pay an attorney or to pay

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,940
an accountant but just because you can

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,610
do your taxes or you can enter the phone

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,860
and be your own assistant doesn't mean

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,560
you should write there are people who do

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,930
those things very well and relying on

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,830
them means that they will do it more

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:29,900
effectively more efficiently and you get

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:32,930
to do more of the work that you love do

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,610
not surprise people I'm not talking

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,620
about gifts or pleasant surprises like

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,560
hey we finished under budget and ahead

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,300
of schedule that's fantastic what I'm

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,430
talking about here is stay in

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,830
communication the moment you see a

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,800
yellow flag or you see a risk of the

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,680
project timeline slipping or the budget

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,370
going over or the scope creeping

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,920
whatever it is flag that and communicate

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,540
about it what I had a tendency to do is

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
when a project started getting difficult

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,100
I would say you know what this is

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,860
slipping but if I just take this one

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,350
weekend to work on it and I'll just

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,690
it'll be fine I'll just work all weekend

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,900
and on Monday I'll ship it they'll be

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:17,660
happy everyone will love me oh it's such

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,100
 it's not true you know i mean

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,950
first of all who wants to give up a

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,800
weekend and second of all the problem is

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,450
I went radio silent and what I kept

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,740
having to learn again and again and

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,270
again is that people are a lot more

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,330
reasonable and forgiving than you think

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,220
they are right if you see the project

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,800
slipping in any way and you let them

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,760
know when you know chances are they're

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,950
going to be reasonable to say hey you

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,640
know what that's fine we can work around

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:47,240
that but if you're silent and then you

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:51,380
also failed to deliver then that's a

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:55,340
disaster and nobody's happy number four

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,900
do not give it away for free whether I'm

00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,610
not saying don't do pro bono work that's

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,350
fantastic i'm not saying don't help your

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,480
family your friends or your church

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,510
whatever that's fantastic but always

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,210
send an invoice list your full rates if

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,280
they're getting a discount list what

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,380
that discount is because otherwise they

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,130
may not know how valuable your time

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,370
really is always ask for a referral

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,950
because why not it's the least they can

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,960
do maybe get a testimonial as well to

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,530
build out your ears your social proof of

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,030
how skilled you are and you can always

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,680
barter as well so there are a lot of

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,730
ways to avoid giving it away for free

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:38,300
but certainly don't do that number three

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,460
do not overcome it no is the most

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,320
powerful powerful word in the English

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:46,190
language and it is so hard to say

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,200
sometimes we def Nicholson gave a great

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,540
talk on on how to say no like a boss

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,980
it's a from Apache con I believe and I

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,070
cannot recommend it enough the

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,860
recordings on YouTube say no prioritized

00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,690
ruthlessly connect delegate subcontract

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,090
anything you can do to make sure that

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,770
your workload maintains reasonable and

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:08,000
that you don't surprise people with the

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,550
disaster number two don't work without a

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,260
contract a lot of people have the sense

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,550
that contracts are a punitive thing and

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,920
you only use them with people you don't

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,670
trust it's not true that's not at all

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,590
true even an email okay I am NOT a

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,780
lawyer pending under jurisdiction even

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,640
an email or an invoice can serve as a

00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,600
contract but certainly the case in

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,820
California contracts can be short and

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,640
sweet they can often be in plain English

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,360
and that's fine there are a number of

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,279
key clause

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,269
is to make sure that you have in your

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,100
contract for instance you want to have

00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,570
licensing spelled out right you're not

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,839
selling somebody at django you're

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,940
selling them customizations contracts

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,230
will include contact information it will

00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,529
set expectations around your

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,690
communication right what happens if you

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,540
don't hear from the client for 48 hours

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,800
or 4 30 days okay well you can't be on

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,399
the hook for that you have to be able to

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,620
move on key closet is also include

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,250
payment right how do you get paid are

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,560
there installments and what kind of

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,720
terms are on that payment right how long

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,260
do they have and what kind of late fees

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,850
are there if any warranty and service

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,880
level agreement what kind of

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,769
expectations do they have of the

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,500
performance of the project I of the

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,360
product on an ongoing basis right are

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,920
you going to be on the hook for bug

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,040
fixes are going to be on the hook for

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,370
installing patches this is a great way

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,190
to inject a to lead to a conversation

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,390
about a maintenance contract and I said

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,190
earlier if you're working for yourself

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,070
the shortest path the more money is the

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:51,740
clients who already have maintenance is

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:53,870
not glorious work but it certainly tends

00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,510
to be easier work and it will keep keep

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,100
the money money coming in that helps you

00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,959
also with recurring income that you

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,189
don't have to work as hard for every

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:07,010
month to other really important things

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:12,429
that I find in contracts include

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:14,510
arbitration nobody wants to go to court

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,860
let me if you've never been to court let

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,179
me just tell you now you don't want to

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:22,760
do it it sucks it's expensive and it's

00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:25,699
just a waste of time so an arbitration

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,549
clause will say you know if we disagree

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,830
or someone violates the terms of this

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,650
contract we're going to go to so-and-so

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,160
Arbitration Association who usually have

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,549
either retired attorneys on staff or

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,429
kind of retired judges who will help you

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:46,340
have like a civil discussion with all

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,600
the fanfare and extra costs and all the

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,530
challenges that come with actually going

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,530
to court and being sued

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:56,450
arbitration clauses they're fantastic

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,240
also expert you know wind is that

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:03,770
windows the contract terminates how long

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:08,960
is it enforcement for now not to dwell

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:11,630
too long on contracts but because legal

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,260
professionals time is not cheap it's

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,299
really really tempting to use templates

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,870
templates are a great starting point to

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,450
educate yourself but do not use a

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,559
templated contract it may not have

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,590
planned may not be valid in your

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,390
jurisdiction it may just not even

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:34,070
contain things that are reasonable the

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,260
four hundred dollars an hour you spend

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,110
on an attorney to write the contract for

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,580
you and the whatever you pay them to

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,679
amend it on an ongoing basis when

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,630
necessary and some of the best money you

00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:52,760
will spend yeah you will invest in

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:58,660
yourself one last thing to say here is

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,660
that the contract can also contain Oh

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,809
brain fart the first okay well we're

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,030
thus far in and only one brain part so

00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,010
far so we're doing all right but do not

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:15,770
work without a contract just trust me on

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:20,030
that one okay so this this thing here I

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:22,630
think in my experience running running

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,490
my businesses into the ground perhaps

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,540
this is the failure I by the mistake I

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,640
made again and again and again so what

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,429
does it mean to fail to measure this

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,080
means to fail to track your time this

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:38,480
means to fail to understand the

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,740
fundamentals of your business right do

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,510
you understand do you understand what

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,790
you personally need to earn as an

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,860
individual to get by and not just to get

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:51,080
by but to make to reach your goals your

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,240
personal savings or investment goals do

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,400
you know what it's going to cost to pay

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,830
your employer but your employees or your

00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,520
subcontractors now that sounds obvious

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,970
but I didn't write these are mistake

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,120
second that you can make

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,650
um do you know what your capacity is

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,909
right like how much work can you

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,370
actually get done in a week how many

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,049
billable hours can you actually get done

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,580
in a week right because there's a

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,590
difference between productive time that

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,320
can be billed and time working on the

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,260
business itself you know I would have to

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,210
do sales and I would have to do

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,710
estimates and you know producing a scope

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,940
of work documents all manner of things

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:33,630
that I wasn't getting paid for and I

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,309
wasn't really counting that in so if you

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,900
don't know what your capacity is for

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:38,460
work how much you can actually get done

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,610
and how much of that can actually be

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,960
billable hours every week well you're

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,110
certainly not going to know what your

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,000
utilization of that capacity is right so

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,830
your utilization of that capacity is how

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,200
much of my time is already committed to

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,700
getting things done and the reason you

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,419
want to know do not just your capacity

00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,299
but your utilization thereof is what if

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,980
you're not making enough money what if

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,470
you continue running into financial

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,440
issues and you're not exactly sure why

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,700
if you know these members if you know

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,559
your budget your capacity and

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,480
utilization thereof then you can realize

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,179
that hey you know I'm already maxed out

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,600
on how much work i can done I can do so

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:23,880
I guess it's time to raise my rates you

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,409
really need to understand a fundamental

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,760
of your business and track your time so

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,890
you can make better estimates etc etc

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,169
having the numbers of you to run your

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,929
business is really really critical and

00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:36,390
it seems obvious but again if we get

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,130
into working for ourselves or just in

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:41,190
the industry in general we're usually in

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,500
it because we love the craft we don't

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,570
love it because we are bookkeepers or

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,590
financial planners and this is a place

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,929
where you might want to hire somebody

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:56,250
again to help you with these things one

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:57,750
thing that I ran into I didn't have the

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,299
fundamentals of my business figured out

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:05,940
and so I would work and work and work

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:09,870
myself just run myself ragged and I

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:13,320
would continue to not make goals pay the

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:15,870
bills etc and so because I didn't know

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,440
that I could just raise my rates I

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,610
didn't know that

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,050
that's really where the problem was

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,080
because my capacity was already maxed

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:26,490
out I ended up having a house of cards I

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,240
think the technical term for this is I

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:34,050
Ponzi schemed myself I was using the

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,780
deposit from a new project to pay my

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,790
subcontractors for the last project now

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,960
that should be a red flag but when

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,730
you're in the thick of it and you're

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,200
just trying to survive you may not

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:49,080
notice even red flags so I can't stress

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,250
it enough do not fail to measure you

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,460
know when I was in the thick of it and

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,930
getting things done I had a voice in the

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,640
back of my head saying oh you know it's

00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,250
best practices to track your time so you

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,050
can build better estimates but then I

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,840
would just say oh well you know I don't

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,660
actually have time to track my time

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,220
what's no no these are not miniscule

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,840
administrative paths that don't matter

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,160
their critical to making sure that

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,630
you're going to survive and not just

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:21,480
survive but thrive so please please do

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:25,520
not fail to measure okay enough about

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,520
failure let's talk about how to recover

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:34,140
just like every failure is different so

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,750
is every recovery what you do to recover

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,530
depends on the details of the failure

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,750
and and who you are there are three big

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:46,260
three things that I always try to think

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:48,840
through when I fail there's managing the

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:53,670
relationship that is managing yourself

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,840
and there's managing your reputation so

00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:59,460
let's spend a little time on each of

00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,990
these as we wrap up here there's an

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,580
unfortunate calculus that goes with

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,690
failure especially when you if they're

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,690
large enough that you have to think

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,640
about managing the relationship you have

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:13,170
to decide whether it's worth saving the

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,000
relationship or terminating it this is

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:18,000
not just the relationship with your

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,800
co-workers or your clients this is a

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,580
relationship with your manager your

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:27,420
friends this is everybody around you and

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:30,300
sometimes it's just a matter of making a

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,480
really good apology right we all make

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,090
stakes that's understandable and when I

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,860
say making it you know making a really

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,130
good apology I really mean that because

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,310
it is really easy really really easy to

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,810
make a really crappy apology right I'm

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,030
sorry I made you feel that way or you

00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:50,340
know whatever it is like no no no this

00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,290
is on you take responsibility there are

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,270
there's an endless well of resources on

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:58,020
the internet about how to apologize well

00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,930
and that is really valuable a really

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,300
really valuable resource so when you're

00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,770
doing the calculus of whether to save or

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,510
terminate a relationship one thing to

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,320
consider is how much social capital do

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:12,210
you have with this person right like how

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,980
much did they like you right or has this

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,630
been a strained relationship for a long

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,330
time such that it's getting really

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,340
difficult to save it if you don't have

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,420
much social capital and the failure is

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:27,090
pretty significant magnitude you may not

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,760
be able to recover that relationship but

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,730
you should still offer a good apology

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,700
you should still say thanks for the

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:39,960
opportunity to work with you I'm sorry

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,330
it didn't pan out in terms of saving the

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,740
relationship think through what it takes

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,690
to make amends with this person right

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,550
perhaps you can save the project perhaps

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,620
you don't have to terminate the project

00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,060
in both you know walk away perhaps you

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,200
just need to adjust the scope of the

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,850
project you know maybe maybe you allowed

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,830
scope creep and you didn't manage it and

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,330
you finally have to say you know what

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,830
this isn't what we originally talked

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,020
about and i'm sorry i didn't manage the

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,520
change in scope but this is this is what

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:18,210
we're not have to do to be able to move

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:20,130
on now terminating the relationship it's

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,770
not an enjoyable thing to do but it is

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,090
an important thing to do when you

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,310
consider how much effort it might take

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,650
to save the relationship and this

00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,180
doesn't mean burning bridges it's a

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,380
really really compelling image but no

00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,330
i'm not talking about setting your

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,470
relationships on fire first you want to

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,080
think about what's the legal process

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,370
because you've got a contract right

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,160
what's the legal process for unwinding

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,560
your relationship and make sure

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,960
that it's a Nana cabool termination

00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:55,170
right you want to be sure that that

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,870
you're not flinging mud there I mean

00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,160
look this person whoever they are

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,140
they're going to do whatever they're

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,330
going to do this is an important time to

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,650
take the high road right accept

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,530
responsibility for the ways that you

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:10,890
screwed up say thanks for the

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:16,440
opportunity and be as friendly as

00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:18,270
possible in parting and separating it's

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,700
often useful to have a narrative here

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,980
right like why things went wrong I'm not

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,190
saying a fiction but in narrative right

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,260
because failures the work we do is

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,840
complex there are a lot of variables at

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,690
play and so it's not always obvious why

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,790
things went wrong so having a narrative

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,080
that sort of paints the picture break

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,290
connects the dots or somebody and be

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,360
really really helpful now this is a

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,770
person that still worth working with

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,290
they're not just an individual who's

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,420
really difficult to work with refer them

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,470
to somebody right say hey you know what

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:56,360
I wasn't the right person for the job

00:27:49,470 --> 00:28:01,230
but this person may be managing yourself

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:04,530
failure feels larger than life managing

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,900
yourself is really difficult know that

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,880
it's not the end know that you will get

00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,170
to the end of it just by taking one step

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,260
at a time because I can feel

00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,210
overwhelming empower yourself something

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,770
that i did as i often would fall into a

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,200
depression after a failure of a certain

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,960
size and you know even just cleaning my

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,910
house would give me a sense of power and

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,100
a sense of like you know what I'm in

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,200
control of some of these things it's got

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,220
to be fine now whatever it is for you

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,920
make sure that you take you you take

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,210
care of yourself don't withdraw use your

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,530
social network and your friends and your

00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,590
family they're more important than ever

00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:44,330
in times of failure I don't lash out

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:47,160
don't point the finger and blame people

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,510
your number one goal when you are when

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,730
you're recovering from failure is to

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,930
communicate productivity can come later

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,370
you know you don't you never want to go

00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,220
radio silent on people but maybe you

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,450
need to stop working for a while and

00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,050
just remember that we are larger than

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,920
the work we

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:04,970
do so when our work fails that's fine

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,560
that's not us as a person feeling

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,710
managing your reputation I think this is

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,660
one of the things about failures that it

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,020
that's scary is that it can be

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:18,360
embarrassing and shameful but it really

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,130
ought not to be so manage your

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,760
reputation what I had the great luck of

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,730
doing is after my startup fired me the

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,310
startup I founded I had been organizing

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,470
a charity hackathon right and I helped I

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,000
ran a local meetup and so my failure was

00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,500
not a private failure I didn't have an

00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,630
option to be quiet about it so happily

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,430
by doing good work by putting one foot

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,220
in front of the other and owning the

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,570
mistakes I made people saw there's a

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,430
young professional who really just

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,590
deeply screwed up but he's doing good

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,680
work and he's moving forward what more

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:55,320
can you really ask from a person so to

00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,840
wrap up here manage your reputation

00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,970
don't be silent about these things have

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,310
a story to make sense of it all don't

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:05,610
don't point the finger take the high

00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:07,740
road and just know that even it's even

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,380
reasons for failure and sound a lot like

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,350
excuses and excuses are unbecoming you

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,640
really don't want to like dive into that

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,280
maybe later at a post-mortem you can

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,120
figure out what actually happened and

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,370
please please share your lessons so

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,900
that's all I've got for you my hope is

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,880
that this talk will help you to see

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,680
failure before it before it comes you

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,810
can mitigate your risks you can do

00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,790
better post mortems you can recover more

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,290
swiftly and all around feel more

00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,560
comfortable talking about the hard thing

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:48,810
that is failure so please feel well

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:50,310
thank you Thank You Josh we do not have

00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,450
time question for questions now so I'm

00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,940
sure you can find him in the hallways

00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,220
he's not hard to find will resume in ten

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,480
minutes with more testing with fewer

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,480
