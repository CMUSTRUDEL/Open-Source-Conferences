Title: Preventing Cat-astrophes with GNU MediaGoblin

What would happen to all the cat videos if YouTube were to disappear? It would be a cat-atstrophe!

GNU MediaGoblin is Python-based media publishing system for artists â€” an alternative to centralised, censored and surveilled systems like Flickr, YouTube and SoundCloud. MediaGoblin gives people privacy, choice and control of their own media, something we need now more than ever.

This talk will explore the architecture of GNU MediaGoblin, the technical challenges in implementing fully decentralised sharing and commenting through PyPump and the Pump.io API as well as work to lower the Python deployment barrier to empower normal people to escape the centralised systems ("userops").

thanks very much so I first met maybe a

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,210
goblin about four and a half years ago

00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,040
we were sitting in our flat in Brunswick

00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,100
surrounded by cardboard boxes eating

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,240
Thai takeaway off a card table and if

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,140
you've ever tried to eat anything off a

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,289
card table you know it's very

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,539
challenging let alone when you're about

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,640
to give birth in a day or twos time so

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,599
my wife and I were sitting there eating

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,910
having this discussion and this

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,030
discussion about sharing photos and

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,430
videos and audio of our new family

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,280
member and there's quite there's nothing

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,640
quite like trying to make it a privacy

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
decision for someone who can't make it

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,539
themselves but you know that's closely

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,149
related to you to really height in that

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,340
sort of discussion so that's really

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,670
where i came to start thinking a lot

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,050
about media goblin you might take away

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,199
from that that media goblin is a tool

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,270
for hacker parents to to use for photos

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:10,650
for their children that's not actually

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:13,740
the case so mini goblin is neither for

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,150
just for hackers or four or strictly for

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,630
for baby photos but it's a media tool

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,430
for artists artists and painters and

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,229
illustrators and musicians and 3d

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,930
illustrators and modelers and things

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,390
like that it's a it's a gallery format

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,549
type tool so the idea is that it's for

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,150
curating you know beautiful and

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,850
interesting things not not mass amounts

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,670
of them but you know a nice amount of

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,710
really interesting things for you I

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,869
should point like it's actually what I

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,759
mean by not being for hacker parents is

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,649
that it's it's not designed to be a

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,060
system that is only used by technical

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,790
people it's designed to be something

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,710
that anyone can work on their piece of

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,329
art and throw it onto media goblin as a

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,580
an afterthought as such so I'll show you

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,290
actually that's probably the best way

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,670
so this is gonna meet a goblin it's a

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:19,020
web application it's a Python

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:22,240
server-side system it's it's written in

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,280
things that alike its Django ish in in

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,420
what it's written in it uses sqlalchemy

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,520
postgres and if you are the things that

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,850
make that if you if you knew Django and

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,650
you walked into it you'd you'd recognize

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,820
some things so let me let me log in this

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,050
is the home page so you can see I've

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,890
uploaded some things here already a

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:52,690
login I already have an account on this

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:53,980
system okay so i'll upload a photo now

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,450
I'm a very passionate free software

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,520
activist but there are some things that

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,660
I find that are more important to me

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,470
than free software and one of those

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:07,240
these bikes so this is a photo of a type

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,190
of bicycle that I actually own one of

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,459
these were just so sorry this great

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,320
little small okay okay so media hablen

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,269
lets you upload a piece of media as you

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,880
saw i selected a photo which you had a

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,620
title all the metadata you want so

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,390
you've got tags you've got a license

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,970
this one's there's a default you can set

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,610
for your profile off your ad and it

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,260
comes back straightaway saying thanks

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,550
you've submitted some media we can

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,290
actually see that media there yet

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,019
because there's actually two parts of

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,450
this there's the there's the front end

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,040
web process running then there's also

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,140
the process running behind the scenes

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,269
that does the processing of the media so

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,350
for images it might only take a fraction

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,290
of a second and you might not notice

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,670
anyway but for audio and video and other

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,739
things which I'll show you in a moment

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,070
it does take a substantial amount of

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,040
time so if i refresh here well you

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,810
should see a new photo there so I'll go

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,790
back to the homepage just so you can get

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,620
the full effect so here's the photo of

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,750
the bike this is it's a tricycle

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,350
actually I take my kids around this it's

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,380
awesome so we have all the kind of nice

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,550
features that people expect in modern

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,060
web applications where we've got

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,400
commenting we've got x licensing

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,320
media goblin also takes community really

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,690
seriously so there's things like

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,030
reporting a comment if you think it's

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,980
inappropriate or reporting a piece of

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,410
media if you think it's inappropriate

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,980
and that's based on the terms of service

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,870
of the media goblin site not any global

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,250
sort of terms of service so this is an

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,010
instance that you run a new determine

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,990
the terms of service form there's a

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,660
whole lot of plugins that come with this

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,580
that you can turn on things like geo

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,790
tagging of photos so if you've got a

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,490
photo that has your digital camera

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,919
records a GPS reading on it it'll

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:02,330
display a little map in the corner to

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,850
show you where it was taken and which

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:12,350
nicely on mobile all this sort of stuff

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:15,229
so that's photo let me show you audio so

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,930
the idea being here that as opposed to

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,389
just a flicker reimplement ation which

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,460
might just photos or just a soundcloud

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,890
implementation which might do audio or

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,560
just youtube or finger verse that does

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,410
3d models which I'll get to in a second

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,880
the the idea is that it's cross media so

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,520
it's centered around the author not the

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,260
immediate type so here I'm the author

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,810
and I've this is another piece of media

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,450
I produced this is a recording my son

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,060
and I did for to remind us to put the

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,729
trucks in at night chickens if you not

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,870
from Australia but that's so that the

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:57,470
foxes don't get them so if they have

00:05:47,870 --> 00:06:00,050
this alarm on our phone to remind us so

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,919
you get this nice spectrograph you get a

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,380
nice smooth media player and all

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:13,310
integrates really nicely we can add

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:17,470
comments if we want scroll down to find

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,470
the button somewhere here there we go

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,350
similarly for video you got a nice video

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,690
player this is the FSF 30th birthday

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,430
celebration video definitely worth a

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,220
look at some point if you turn it all

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,790
around us

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:37,400
make some really nice points so you know

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:39,720
that would be the YouTube use case

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,330
excuse me this is definitely the most

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,790
compelling for me the video aspect of

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,130
this because being a technical person I

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,570
know how to use you know I've strung

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:53,880
together gstreamer pipelines and ffmpeg

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,650
commands and AV com when that changes

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,320
versions and I've written all this stuff

00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,550
down but it's still painful you know you

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,170
have to make these really hard decisions

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,160
about what resolution it should be and

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,960
then you have to make sure it's named

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,540
right you have to change the HTML files

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,100
to to embed the video it's just really

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,420
painful and this is just a beautiful

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:18,840
experience just to be able to take a

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:22,950
piece of video and there it is so there

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,790
we go so we've got photos audio video we

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:30,690
also do a PDF so this is a plug-in that

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,250
ads PDF embedding so this could be for

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,870
instance if you did talks you could put

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,090
your talk slides on here as well as your

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,400
video or you're already of your talks

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,450
you get this is the PDF jeaious viewer

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,690
so we can actually scroll the way

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:47,820
through you have to download the

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:51,419
original PDF file as well and for my

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:55,100
last demo i'll upload a new file this

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,100
one's quite an exciting one actually so

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,979
the backstory to this model this is a

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,900
snail model my friend made a 3d game in

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:10,200
blender which is based on Python 3

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:12,200
actually by the way snail so the game's

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,610
called cargo which is she can look up

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,620
now so nothing's happened there is that

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,070
you can see let me just see if I can

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,870
pull up the terminal in the right place

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:26,120
can I bring up to the front yes there we

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,680
go

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,180
the secondary process that I was talking

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,590
about so there's the the the web

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,210
front-end process and then there's this

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,279
celery back end process which is now

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,020
just finished but you saw some some

00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,210
screens of information scrolling there

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,940
that was meaty government talking to

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,289
blend up so it's taken this 3d stl model

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,510
which is a model that you'd use for 3d

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,060
printing or something like this and it's

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,970
a splendid to pre-render some shots of

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,920
this is thready farm so this is a this

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,150
is a thing of earth type replacement now

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,760
this plug-in came as it was written in

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,690
response to a bounty by a ver one of the

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,570
media goblin community members to win a

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,130
3d printer and it came about in two two

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:14,029
evenings I think which is incredibly

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:16,460
fast so there's us know so we go it's a

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,620
few different shots here front top side

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,620
and then we've got this quite remarkable

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:27,170
WebGL version as well so here's your

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,940
finger verse replacement so that's

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,740
really yeah I was quite impressed by

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:41,300
that you can also download the scl model

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:48,980
great for you on a 3d printed ochio

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:51,459
acceptable slides back up excuse me just

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,459
one second

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,860
okay so media goblin is Python 3 as I

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,190
mentioned it's Python 3 hours of the

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,110
recent 0.9 release its licensed under

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,760
the affero GPL which is an excellent

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,029
license if you are writing a program

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,190
that runs on a server has Django like

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,870
stack which I mentioned lots of things

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,230
there you'd be familiar with if you if

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:25,730
you had done Django web apps before use

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,709
gstreamer which is a really rigorous

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,930
solid reliable media transcoding

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,110
platform especially as off version 1.0

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,120
which is upgraded about a year ago this

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,100
if you've ever tried media goblin before

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,270
and had some issues transcoding

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,920
different types of video it's working

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,339
really well now so definitely another

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,100
shot it's a fully pluggable architecture

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,980
so everything including the you know the

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,270
geo tagging the authentication media

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,399
types all this sort of stuff is done

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,459
with class and plugins so you can write

00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,350
a Python module and add that to the

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,080
system and you can have your own media

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,000
type or ldap authentication well there's

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,770
already a ledapple authentication but

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,050
you get all that sort of stuff and it

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:10,140
has an API as well so web the web front

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,990
end is great but an API is really

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,270
helpful for things like clients that

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,180
need to be able to talk to it let me

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:29,730
show you that as well I mean to show

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:31,830
that a second ago okay so you may have

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,140
heard of the social network pump I oh

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,350
it's the second generation based on

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,180
statusnet pumper is a client for pump

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,950
iron and meaty goblin implements the

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,390
pump i/o client to server protocol so

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,800
here pump are the social network client

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,570
is talking directly to me d Goblin and

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,820
pumper doesn't know that it's media

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,790
goblin it doesn't actually care but what

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,690
we'll do is we'll add a comment here

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,680
nothing like actually does anything but

00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:03,329
we'll add I like bikes send that message

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,100
then if we jump across here I will see

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:08,440
that it should be a comment down here

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,770
somewhere yeah it would I like bikes

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,120
so that's really important so we've got

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,170
we're hooking into an existing social

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,120
network here we're not trying to

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,010
reinvent the wheel with a new tool which

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,390
really in the social networking

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:27,090
environment you can't afford to start

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:30,040
your own social network back to start

00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:33,460
okay so that that client to server API

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,110
happens through this the actual name for

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,850
the pump i/o API is called activity

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,270
streams it's basically shunting a

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:45,520
JavaScript adjacent block of data around

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,590
saying this C Weber posted an image the

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,700
details that don't matter so much

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,710
there's also a command line uploading

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,970
tool which is great if you're doing a

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,830
whole lot of stuff like you're running a

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,080
conference something like that I find

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,680
this really useful too is that too to

00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,790
upload local user group videos just slow

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,100
down if they're to wait for the web

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:12,010
interface I can copy the files straight

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:13,390
up to the server so but as an activist I

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,580
mean I think this is really important

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,170
having independent media but I realized

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,020
that everyone has different priorities

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,130
in their own lives and as an activist I

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,260
think it's really important you act on

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,510
your own values and priorities as

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,040
opposed to what minor so meaty goblin

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,880
might not actually be the right tool for

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,890
you if you're happy just sticking your

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,330
videos up on YouTube and your photos up

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,280
on Flickr or Facebook or something like

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,050
that everyone has to you know you have a

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,520
limited amount of time in your life to

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,420
think about these things and some of

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,370
these things might not be quite so

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:47,230
important to you that said let's not

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,210
forget where we're putting these

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,570
cultural works that are really important

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:55,900
to us so these companies generally for

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,940
put companies have slightly different

00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:03,490
values to us there are some sacrifices

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:05,980
here so they as some of the things that

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,410
the companies get the Flickr YouTube the

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,260
facebook or worse of stuff is control

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,600
over who sees the media they get to

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,980
censor unfavorable or challenging

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,270
content for example New Zealand

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,180
political cartoonist Malcolm Evans

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:25,770
cartoons about the Israeli Palestine

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:30,089
conflict or say you're a punk rock band

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,800
 Riot and making music about

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,529
Vladimir Putin and the church's

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,000
involvement in his election things like

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,190
this actually really matter and having

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,600
an independent place to put media and

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,600
publish that is outside what large

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:52,510
for-profit companies deemed to be

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:55,000
appropriate it's really important the

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:59,380
other issue is some of the broad

00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,339
sweeping keyword-based DCMA which is a

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,640
copyright infringement takedown notices

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:09,430
these these are left to the onus the

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,750
onus is on the owner to respond to these

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,360
things and try and get their media back

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,500
up in these sort of systems where if

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,029
you're running your own media system

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,740
like in a meeting hablen you don't get

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,810
that there's also this subtle effect

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,180
where you have automated popularity

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,950
rankings so these sites get to decide

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,330
what is popular because there is an

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,890
algorithm out there that is determining

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,200
this or someone's tweaking that

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,450
algorithm to determine quite what is

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,339
popular and I feel that these sort of

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,980
things tend to strip a little bit the

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,740
richness and the diversity out of out of

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,180
our our media we lose some of the unique

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:48,820
perspectives and we get this sort of

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:52,089
bland mainstream view of things and who

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,459
is to say well what if someone's

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:57,250
whatever they say what was plaque on

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:59,440
like 50 years ago well with what do

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,110
people do there because suddenly the

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,330
company doesn't value just keeping those

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,860
those videos around I'm sure I'm not the

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,000
only one who's gone to look at an old

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,829
talk that I was really looking forward

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,930
to and found that the the video is no

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,209
longer online because the site had shut

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,940
down or something like that it doesn't

00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:17,910
need to be a big bang effect like this

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,620
it could just be the slow erosion of

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,300
unpopular videos being taken down

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,800
because they cost too much for the for

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:29,380
the company to to manage that said the

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,020
aim isn't to replace enormous media

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,560
hosting sites here the idea is to scale

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,650
down to an individual household

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,150
and organizations and community groups

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,310
so that these people have the power in

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:46,420
themselves to host their own media under

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,190
their own terms of service the idea is

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,550
for it to be non-technical so that

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,050
anyone can you know the vision is to

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,460
someone to be able to buy one of these

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,170
things off the shelf plug it in and

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,200
there you go you can drag your media

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,310
onto it and publisher like that and now

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,529
is the right time for this sort of thing

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,530
because we have affordable low-power

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:09,670
hardware and we have fiber to the home

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,990
in some places I was lucky enough to to

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,750
move into a place where the first roll

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,850
out of that was so I feel like I can

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,500
giggle about that a little bit but the

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,860
point here is that you control the data

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,949
you get to choose what the terms of

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,710
service are and what what doesn't fit

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:34,720
those terms of service so many goblin is

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:38,490
at version 0.9 at the moment it's a

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:43,090
young and ambitious project that has a

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:45,040
whole lot more vision than just a photo

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,690
gallery it's really talking about

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:55,030
building the modern social web to to

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:57,040
enable independent publishing so the

00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,929
idea is not so I'll talk about this

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,210
thing called Federation so at the moment

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,070
we have this approach where it's

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,590
distributed as such in that you could

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,670
run your own server in your own house

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,290
but that's not enough we actually want

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,870
these we want the features of the modern

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,090
social web where people can take can see

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,260
a photo on someone else's site and

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,020
comment on it and share it and all this

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,790
sort of stuff and a whole lot of the

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,070
plumbing for these Federation features

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,320
happen in 0.9 but we're really looking

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,970
forward to 1.0 to actually bring this

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,910
all together and give us these these

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,100
real these features that's under active

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,380
development at the moment the core

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,190
developer jessica as has been working

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,160
really hard on that Federation itself I

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,760
should I should explain because it's

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,440
kind of a it's an unclear topic so I

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,520
talked earlier about the client to

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,149
server API Federation is much like I

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,309
think of it like

00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:54,279
email in a way it's the server to server

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:56,049
API so the idea is that you have a home

00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,499
server much like you do with your email

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,049
and when you want to do something you do

00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:05,109
that thing to your home server and then

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:08,460
that that effect moves out into the into

00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:14,229
the network so the idea here would be

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:17,259
that I've lost the picture but there so

00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:19,359
you might see a piece of you might be

00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:21,039
subscribed to someone else's media you

00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,489
might comment on it that comment first

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,009
goes to your server which takes a copy

00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:28,029
of it to display in its own information

00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:30,909
wrapped it to the appropriate server on

00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:33,519
the internet that server makes some

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:35,499
state change such as recording a comment

00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,559
against a piece of media and then it

00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:40,719
pushes it into the destination owners

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,009
like the author's inbox so they can see

00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:48,009
it when they next log in this server to

00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:49,690
server API is done in Jason activity

00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:51,940
streams much like the client to server

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,580
but here it's a little bit more verbose

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,899
because we actually have before we knew

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,039
who it was because it was client to

00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:00,759
server we already knew who the client

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,499
was here we need to know who because

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,609
it's going across the internet the the

00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:10,450
servers need to be able to talk about

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:14,649
who the client is yes so as I mentioned

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,119
earlier the idea here is to not reinvent

00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:18,460
the wheel with a new social network

00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,679
because no one wants that and if you

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,139
hopefully you're using pompeo you know

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,749
in a very small way perhaps it's

00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:27,909
certainly not a truly popular social

00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:30,129
network yet but it has the makings of

00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:36,039
something that the open web could really

00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:38,830
embrace and as as a part of that lead

00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,869
developer chris webber who's there with

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,519
the glasses in the middle and jessica

00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:45,159
tellin who's there in the pink and the

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,279
black jumper have been working with the

00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,169
w3c social networking group for the last

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:54,129
two years or so trying to bring some

00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:56,349
standards to these these systems so

00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:58,389
they've been looking really hard at what

00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:59,889
is out there already and what the what

00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,059
the good practices are and trying to

00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:02,220
come up with some great standards for

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,870
this and some

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,520
things they're working on our activity

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,400
streams version 2 which will be adjacent

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,679
LD version and a whole of other little

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,990
bits and pieces which aren't going to

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,720
now that's that's looking really

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,260
exciting it's nice to have some

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,390
formalization of this so that other

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:24,030
networks can can embrace these these

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:27,870
tools too so meaty goblin is turning

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,929
your money into free software Jessica's

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:37,640
all of Jessica's work in the 0.9 version

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:37,640
was funded by the last campaign and the

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,559
media goblin can be a success with your

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,390
support mehdi government is stewarded by

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,270
the Free Software Foundation in the US

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,440
which means that they're obliged to act

00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,929
in the public interest with your money

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,280
so the FSF provides key infrastructure

00:21:54,929 --> 00:22:00,470
such as fundraising platforms and

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,780
networks and all these sort of things to

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,059
media goblin so i'd strongly encourage

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,590
you to donate to media goblin i'd also

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,210
encourage you to become an associate

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,250
member of the FSF because they're a

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,580
fantastic organization that does so much

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,600
with so little and while i'm here and

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,240
while i'm wearing myself a freedom

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,179
Conservancy shirt I'll also give a plug

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,130
for the software freedom Conservancy you

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,580
may have heard of some of their work the

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,799
part of some of the top Python projects

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:33,659
of a steward as a as a non-profit in the

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:37,049
US gee event kallithea mercurial pi PI

00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:39,210
sugar swig and then some non Python ones

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,750
such as bill bot busybox get homebrew

00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:45,150
inkscape qn emu sambar selenium and wine

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,530
and these are projects that have all

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:51,809
chosen to communal eyes their admin

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,730
rather than wasting developers time

00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,919
doing accounting and all this other

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,690
stuff so it's a really good project to

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,840
contribute to they also work incredibly

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:04,409
hard on to two or three full-time

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,659
administrators working for software

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:10,860
freedom Conservancy so please become a

00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:12,809
member of software Conservancy I'll be

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,789
around for the next two days doing

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,499
sprinting so if you'd like to make us

00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,149
start contributing to media goblin or

00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:23,580
free software in general come and come

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:27,279
and join me I'd love to help you out and

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,710
to summarize many goblin is media

00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,529
hosting for artists so if you're a pixel

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,039
artist you write research papers meetup

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,389
recordings podcasting stop motion videos

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,320
talk at conferences photograph food

00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:43,749
produce a screencast or growing your

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,509
very own hacker baby media goblin is for

00:23:43,749 --> 00:23:48,399
you so get out there do something

00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:57,519
amazing and show the world with Canon

00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:59,529
many gobbler thank you thank you been we

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,349
have a few minutes for questions oh wow

00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,929
gone down well that's going down I'm a

00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:06,820
consulting software engineer and user

00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:08,139
experience developer so I'm always happy

00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,729
to talk to interesting people about

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:11,889
interesting problems so come and find me

00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:13,149
if you have something like that thanks

00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,979
for the talk it's one of the gems that

00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,349
you find I wasn't expecting that for us

00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:19,179
so it was a really interesting talk one

00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:22,840
of the questions I wanted to ask was how

00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,159
do you propose do you support OEM bed

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,169
because that's one of the ways that

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,220
existing services can very easily get

00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:31,960
media from a public site on to their

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,570
embedded blog and things like that so is

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,159
that one of the features that I don't

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,659
think we do I'd have to double check on

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,070
that but that would be a really good

00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,340
feature to have and it'd be a one that

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,359
could easily happen in a plug-in so

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,570
maybe you can come onto this printing

00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:51,249
help us out yeah thanks for the talk um

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:54,099
I oh do photography right so I've got a

00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:55,659
massive NFS mount share with a stack of

00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:57,070
photos in it can I just point media

00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:59,169
goblins straight at that or do I have to

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,080
import it into the median goblins own

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:03,369
file store or like you showed the

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,139
command line and the web interface to

00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,849
get info you know data into is there a

00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:08,349
way i can just pointed at existing

00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:10,659
chairs no you will have to actually

00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:12,279
import it into the the data store for me

00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,720
to goblin it does all that the hashing

00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,129
and making sure the file names are

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,859
consistent all that sort of stuff and it

00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:19,119
produces intermediate version so safe a

00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:21,609
video it'll cut it down to the right

00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,080
resolution for photos will it'll cut up

00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:25,659
a couple of different resolutions for

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,790
different sized screens for audio it

00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:32,570
will process it into its standard

00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:34,970
where m fiora not to your warmest

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:39,770
bulbous codec and all that sort of stuff

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,910
so no I was a short answer yeah yeah I'm

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,450
going to cheat and ask two questions

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:47,420
sorry I was previously involved in

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,940
developing plumie on plum so I guess my

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,370
question is does media goblin have the

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,430
ability at the moment to allow multiple

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,440
users on a single server and the second

00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,740
question is statistically from that can

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,510
objects have a greater set of metadata

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,700
than what you have pre what you have at

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:08,240
the moment or is a plug-in required to

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,250
do that ok I think I'll try now to what

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,580
I think you're asking so can you do

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,100
multi-site yeah username does maybe

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,430
bobland up my home very salient just

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,150
like my name dot my and my server so at

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:24,770
the moment it's one server instance per

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,930
data store and that's all you get with

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,860
one installation I'd certainly like to

00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:32,060
see it go multi site so you can run I

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,950
mean she could run shared hosting out of

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,230
media goblin hosting is a really big

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,970
problem with this sort of stuff and

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,560
Python certainly hasn't solved it by a

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:44,680
long way and there's some good solutions

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:47,150
like sandstorm do and things like the

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,440
it's called the freedom box these are

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,870
all things that are coming along but

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,430
they're not there yet and I we need a

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,060
good answer for that and the second part

00:26:52,430 --> 00:27:00,230
of that was great this is media data

00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:02,680
really possibly i'm not sure i know the

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,080
data can exist in the database without

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,300
plugins directly at using it at that

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,490
time you can turn plugins off but i

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,520
couldn't say for sure i have a quick

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:16,520
question did tom Eastman's talked

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,440
yesterday about security and tidying up

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,470
things that are uploaded give you pause

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,660
I did enjoy that a lot actually um well

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,680
for my work more than anything but me to

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,870
go but actually does a really good job

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,810
of this stuff already so far names are

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,600
already hashed I did think a little bit

00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:34,280
about how you pars and suck the

00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,080
information out of PDF without actually

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,110
modifying it too much but yeah

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,790
interesting I noticed it had pump i/o

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,590
support I was wondering you had canoe

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:49,100
social support as well

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:51,409
no so yeah so there's a I guess you just

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,620
have to pick pick where you're going

00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:56,539
with that so good new social being the

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,390
the predecessor for plant bio in terms

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,919
of you know it was statusnet and good

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:04,700
new social spun out of being able to

00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:08,750
keep that that network alive there's no

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:11,289
reason it couldn't but maybe because the

00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,450
the core developer of going to statusnet

00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:16,309
move to pump i/o without knowing too

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,120
much about it myself I'd sort of lean

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:22,159
towards just going pump I oh I'm I'm not

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,500
a truly informed person about to make

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,130
that decision but yeah i think it

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:31,850
probably will stay pump io one of the

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:36,080
benefits of using public cloud services

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:37,429
is back up so if you go things might

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,090
happen on youtube it is unlikely they're

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:43,100
going to lose my data does meaty goblin

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,870
do anything like that can it store it to

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,549
s3 or things like that or is that just a

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,399
separate thing you have to backup server

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:51,080
like any other databases etc yeah I mean

00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:53,720
it's essentially left you I mean I don't

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,640
think YouTube will lose your data in the

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,890
short term but we don't know about the

00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,539
longer term and dcma takedowns and all

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,730
that sort of stuff if you're running

00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,260
this on your own you are on your own to

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,929
do your own backups and all that sort of

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:09,679
stuff it's worth pointing out though of

00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:12,169
course that YouTube does offload some of

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,970
these costs by the fact that they sell

00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:16,700
the whole of their data about what

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,590
people do they sell advertising on the

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,299
site they mine a whole lot of data out

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:24,470
of YouTube that lets them offer this

00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:27,830
service for for free of charge generally

00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:30,529
so there are you know you are the

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,630
product of some of these sites is worth

00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,399
kicking your mind okay one last one and

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,980
then of course we got a break so you can

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,390
probably grab bend then I you've already

00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,370
covered a bit of what I was going to ask

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,140
in terms of hosting it's more sort of

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,789
from my ops background but I was going

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,460
to ask about the backups I'm have you

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,559
got sort of a clear path for someone who

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,789
might want to host on their own virtual

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,590
private server or something like that so

00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:55,039
you can do a bit of the backup type

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,920
stuff with an image or whatever I know

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,000
you

00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,770
that something you've considered so

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,360
someone could quickly spin up a digital

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,610
ocean instance and use that to host

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,290
their media for example yeah I'm not

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,570
truly across the sand storm that IO

00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:09,630
stuff but i understand that is a

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,590
platform as a service type system where

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,050
you have a recipe that you can

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,850
instantiate to give you a meeting on one

00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,280
server i run it on a virtual server

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,790
myself for three different sites i do my

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,790
