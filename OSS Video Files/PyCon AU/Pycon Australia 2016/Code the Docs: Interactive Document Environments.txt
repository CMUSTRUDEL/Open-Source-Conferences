Title: Code the Docs: Interactive Document Environments
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2016

Distributing example code and applications with documentation is now easy. There are a million different ways to get code to people: from zips, to GitHub, to gists, and beyond. Code is easy to distribute. But how do we create a better link between example code, and written documentation?
Luckily, clever boffins have come up with some solutions: interactive document environments. These let the live code and the documentation sit side-by-side with one another, the distributed example code is the documentation.

This talk will take a brief look at some of the different interactive document environments out there – mainly Jupyter, IPython Notebooks, and Swift Playgrounds – and the various strengths, weaknesses, and caveats of these tools. We’ll also explore the future, and discuss where these tools are going, as well as the implications for technical documentation. Learn how to add interactivity to your documentation, and why this might be a good idea!

okay hello everybody next up we have Tim

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,910
and Paris who are producers at secret

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,550
lab a mobile development studio based in

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,070
Hobart Paris actually co-founded the

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,350
studio and he has written nearly a dozen

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,359
books on game design and mobile software

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,279
development so please welcome Paris and

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:27,480
him and their talk code the docs

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:28,680
interactive document environments thank

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,810
you thank you very much everyone hear me

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,090
okay is that can everyone on yep cool

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,160
I'll try and hold this here hi are we

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,230
here to talk about interactive code

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,640
based documentation environments and all

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,600
the amazing things they can do for you

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
we're gonna give you a big high level

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,110
overview of them and hopefully they will

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,920
inspire you to go away and look at them

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,690
some more so hi I'm Tim I'm the unicorn

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
in this picture in Paris I'm not the

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,239
unicorn you can find us on Twitter

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,100
please feel free to tweet us during the

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,079
presentation sometimes we may reply

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,100
there are two of us that is one of the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,250
benefits of presenting with somebody

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,510
else we're going to take a couple things

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,010
about us to give you some context for

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,960
why we're here to talk to you about this

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,510
specific topic we think they're

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,770
important to the use and context so you

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,229
understand why we think about this so

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,790
much we're horrible academics we're all

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,590
free overqualified and don't do actually

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,990
don't do much actual academia but they

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,299
have it we're also game developers so

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,950
not only overqualified with cocky that's

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,640
Josh in the audience right there with

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,869
Tim we're also taking office so we write

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,680
already killeth amount of books so we

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,200
have to think about how to teach people

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,640
things and on top of that we're also we

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,380
do a lot of teaching both at

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,210
universities and private programming

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,900
teaching we mention we write a whole lot

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,460
of books like a lot of books it's really

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,689
ridiculous amount of books we're not

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,070
really gonna talk about our books though

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,509
we're here to tell you what we've been

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,610
thinking about based on all this stuff

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,840
we actually do um so this sort of all

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,970
came back because we're noticing this

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,560
sort of situation so we we do a lot of

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,780
lecture programming teaching we teach

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,130
all we're primarily teachers I guess

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,619
really is maybe one good way of

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,790
describing us are and we've we've been

00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,680
teaching a lot of things that change

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,719
very quickly in particular been teaching

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,280
apple's new program language swift and i

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,540
know that's not python but you know

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,770
we're not going to focus too much on

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,200
that here you're all very smart people

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,940
you deal with it and we also teach a lot

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
of rapidly changing things like mobile

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,290
technology and they change every six to

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,870
twelve months they're significantly

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,159
different

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,230
what they were for from a program

00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,580
perspective because we teach stuff that

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,930
changes pretty much connelly we have to

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,250
constantly reformulate the material we

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,140
teach with and we've been noticing a lot

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,489
of things that jump out of us about the

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,409
way people learn programming especially

00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:27,489
as we do this a pickle you've been

00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,470
thinking about providing a closer

00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,090
linkage between the documentation the

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,620
training material and the actual code or

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,099
the example material we're trying to

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,599
teach them so we've teach taught classes

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,040
and Swift which is Apple's programming

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,329
since it arrived and will cover Swift

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,010
again a little bit later than anything

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,200
with about two years now and we've

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,700
noticed one thing that really jumped out

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,650
us about the way people learn Swift was

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,390
that they really enjoyed one particular

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,379
faster than apples apples frameworks

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,480
languages which was the thing called

00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,379
Swift playgrounds which is a live

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,579
programming environment or an

00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,329
interactive documentation environment

00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,280
we're going to talk about that a little

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:58,450
bit more in this presentation but Swift

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,159
playgrounds is one of the focuses of

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,340
this presentation so we hear the Python

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,159
get out who would he be here for Python

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,510
at PyCon um so basically this all came

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,890
about again we're academics that

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,010
basically means we stare at people a lot

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,750
and go mm-hmm but basically people mess

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,340
up our they make mistakes when they're

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,530
moved in between the documentation or

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,109
sample code and their own code we sort

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,040
of noticed this there's this disconnect

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,269
especially the new programs as a huge

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,410
disconnecting what they're seeing and

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,340
what they're trying to do with their

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,599
reading documentation so the

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,889
reinterpretation they have to go back to

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,269
the code they're writing they go back

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,620
and forth back and forth maybe they're

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,269
making some notes at the same time it

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,859
all gets very confusing and a lot of

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,900
them just give up because it's kind of

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,220
hard to map everything in your head

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,150
depending on what type of learning you

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,450
are when you're trying to learn like

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,590
that um so we sort of started using

00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,780
these things which were calling

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,069
interactive documentation environments

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,349
which we only just realized recently

00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,090
also is an acronym for ide so that's

00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,349
fine there's no collision that this art

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,730
interactive application environments

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,109
term is out term we don't necessarily

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,419
everyone else calls these things that

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,160
but the basic idea is you take sort of

00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,870
unless you're already a programmer this

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,430
looks like relatively boring comment

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,410
riddle code and it turns it into

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,680
something which is a bit more pretty

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,669
like this so this is a demo will

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,410
actually run through live with you in a

00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,260
minute but that was some sort of code in

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,639
the equivalent playground that shows you

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,519
all the nice documentation alongside the

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,750
code and it's pretty cool it's fully

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,919
interactive it's a real program line we

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,479
just not something made up program would

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,919
you like scratch and so on or I'll

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,909
scratches back spacious great but it's

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,590
it's a real foreign language that you

00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,880
can learn read documentation I'll then

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,510
write your own notes alongside in one

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,100
place

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,750
um so it sort of leads back to this idea

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,170
of having your codes boss you know it's

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,000
possible commendation in the one project

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,560
the one file this these slides are full

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,640
Gaston we did have a reason for that but

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,620
we can't remove what it was because we

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,760
wrote them a while ago um so if anyone

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,160
can figure out why does Gaston in all

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,690
these let us not yet love um but the

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,450
basic idea is that by putting the code

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,130
arm that you're writing alongside the

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,680
documentation that you're reading to try

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,480
and understand it alongside the output

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,130
of said codes there's no difference you

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,530
know you're not losing context is you're

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,790
moving between these different things

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,410
you sort of get this situation which is

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,390
a little bit better your end up with

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,740
something quite useful our people learn

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,960
what they're doing better remember it

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,210
better and have this one central

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,440
canonical source of their notes the

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,520
thing they learn and the documentation

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,280
for it in one place because they can

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,380
sort of build upon it as they go yes so

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,760
the the more works we've explored these

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,380
sort of interactive documentation

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,140
environments the more we thought hey

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,420
these are actually pretty amazing for

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,980
certain types of teaching and learning

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,650
and for certain types of actual

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,150
documentation so we're going to try and

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,370
go through what we think is cool about

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,190
them and hopefully to inspire you all to

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,470
go forth and do something more useful

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,370
than us with them right so there's a

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,900
bunch of different interactive

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,490
programming about documentation varmints

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,780
out there that you're probably familiar

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,520
with Miriam there's Jupiter notebooks

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,410
which was the successor to I pathan in

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,700
many ways there's the Swift phones but

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,140
she already mentioned and there's a

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,370
couple of others we're really really

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,300
going to talk about Jupiter notebooks

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,650
and Swift playgrounds because they're

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,180
the ones we like and they're really the

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,250
only truly good ones as far as we can

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,300
tell please prove us wrong if you have

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,140
any tell us at the end we'd love to

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,060
learn more about other things basically

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,030
there's heaps these are the only good

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,830
ones um so there's a few different sort

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,510
of cool features which really make up

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,280
these different interactive

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,020
documentation requirements they didn't

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,250
feel like saying we've decided make up

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,630
an interactive occupation environment

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,160
just as a heads up this is not an

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,040
industry-wide term this is us making

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,300
stuff up so interactive documentation

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,360
environments feature the ability to live

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,070
code pretty formatting ability to add

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,020
you notes alongside the live code of

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,120
pretty formatting and media rich so you

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,930
can add gifts or gifs depending on what

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,520
you want videos etc etc etc and you are

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,840
using a real programming language not a

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,550
special program which created for the

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,170
purpose of using this environment before

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,260
we go Don does anyone actually call them

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:45,060
gifs here

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,680
oh cool all right sorry that's just that

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,600
you always want yeah there's always one

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,740
so when you view you can put you put

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
your dips and these things in your

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,560
programming real language that's

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,690
basically the features we think make up

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,920
one of these environments so we're

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,840
actually not experts about any of this

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,130
this is just something we really like we

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,150
like to think about this stuff we talked

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,100
about a lot it helps with our

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,590
professional lives and actually I'll own

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,640
personal learning and basically just the

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,620
reason we're giving this talk is because

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,540
we want to share what we've found or

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,370
what we're thinking about to all of you

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,170
who are hopefully all experts and I'm

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,430
going to take these ideas and run with

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,620
them and make something better that then

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,910
we can use in our own stuff so we're

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,180
doing it cuz we're purely selfish

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,350
exactly so the first one which you

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,670
probably many of you familiar with

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,590
ipython notebooks that kind of

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,610
deprecated it now though the original

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,560
interactive Python coding environment

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,270
for science and that sort of thing they

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,140
had a big focus on academic and

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,090
scientific documentation um the thing is

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,110
they're they've actually got pretty good

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,240
support for a whole bunch of stuff but

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,370
they're rarely actually used to teach as

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,890
such so really would you say give

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,020
someone a an iPad notebook and go here

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,730
learn from this it's more like here's

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,560
the results of some experimentation

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,970
we've been doing here's the pretty

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,380
results here's how you can see it you

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,550
can you know filter change it live

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,890
whatever and it's actually really good

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,180
for that but it's not necessarily great

00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,100
for teaching and that sort of gets back

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,260
so it has really good support for text

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,370
equations graph so on and so forth are

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,540
all through Python ah CPAC on and it's

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,010
really good for this but you can't

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,290
really use it for teaching because the

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,880
toolset just isn't designed for far more

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,470
interestingly to us is Jupiter notebooks

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,610
which is somewhat the successor but

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,980
somewhat not um so it's it's a little

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,450
bit different um but it started quite

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,520
recently it's only a few years old now

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,200
it supports multiple languages unlike

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,420
ipython notebooks which just support a

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,490
Python since name when I say that pretty

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,600
much all of them are just Python or

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,260
pretty much all the examples given

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,450
online a Python or are depending on

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,250
which sort of domain you're in otherwise

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,630
it's pretty similar to ipython notebooks

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,490
you have your code some pretty

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,800
formatting you can distribute again it's

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,260
primarily used for I would say

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,850
distributing information to people as

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,830
opposed to trying to learn from it

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,990
really powerful really really cool um

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,390
it's the underlying infrastructure for

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,070
something called I not

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,430
that's an Oriole I assume so it's

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,230
pronounced um which is using Jupiter

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,660
notebooks in a way which i think is

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,740
closer to how these things should be

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,780
used in the future and we'll go through

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,000
it in a little bit later basically

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,200
project Jupiter is this fabulous

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,430
environment for all sorts of program

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,790
languages that really people only use

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,410
for Python and are so the other we're

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,430
going talk about which is the most dear

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,170
to our heart because it's the one we've

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,060
used the mostest switch so we haven't

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,590
really got time to go through everything

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,900
so Swift is one of the things we're

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,100
going to look at and more specifically

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,420
we're not going to be looking at Swift

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,120
per se we're looking at something that

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,640
comes with Swift which is Swift

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,530
playgrounds it's obvious by now this

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,030
talk is about the idea of interactive

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,470
documentation environments regardless of

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,940
the language just so happens Swift and

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,280
Python the two best examples right now

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,480
so if you're not familiar with swiftest

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,950
apples relatively new programming

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,230
language it's open source it's currently

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,050
at version 2.3 version 3 is around the

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,120
corner in next month or three it's under

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,190
the Apache to license its it's great it

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,480
supports mac OS and linux currently and

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,530
it's being used for all sorts of crazy

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,410
stuff and there's a Windows port

00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,270
somewhere um we're a bit biased we like

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,100
Swift it actually shares a lot with

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,390
Python and I suggest you look at it like

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,030
Russell said it's always worth learning

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,560
a second language Swift is similar

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,850
enough to python that in theory you

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
should be able to pick up the basics and

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,040
run with it really quickly but again if

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
you don't want to hey that's your choice

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,440
so two playgrounds of the thing we're

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,210
going to be talked about here um so

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,220
they're kind of being open source loli

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,070
most of it is still closed under apples

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,360
like locker of closed pneus but much of

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,620
it is coming out and we can expect most

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,150
of it to released within a year or two

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,890
we think just based on the trajectory

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,990
apples heading because almost almost

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,250
with all sorts open source now almost

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,620
all of the stuff that goes around Swift

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,850
is slowly being open source but the bit

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,040
we're going to specifically show off

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,450
today is um Swift playgrounds which you

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,290
can get right now today even though it's

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,520
not open it is free as in beer and if

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,750
provide you going to make and again they

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,640
work pretty much the same as like

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,740
ipython notebooks our project you open

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,610
an hour arm it's an interactive coding

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,070
environment you know you're writing the

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,510
code you get to the result immediately

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,430
it's designed for prototyping

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,440
experimentation and learning unlike

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,590
Jupiter notebooks which has a bit more

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,340
of a focus on what the necessary against

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,480
a science but presenting information

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,310
something interesting that it does is

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,960
supports pagination so it was

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,700
designed from the outset to be broken up

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,529
into sort of a logical structure similar

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,420
to a book so you can go hey here's page

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,600
one turn page to page three page for

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,850
someone so forth much like project

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,250
Jupiter it supports mark down and sort

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,560
of HTML ish yeah I won't get into that

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,550
there um fer for pretty formatting so

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,230
this is an example of the markdown

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,339
playground which is kind of saw earlier

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,570
but basically you can do pretty much

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,190
what you'd expect and make things look

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,540
reasonably pretty there's a lot of

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,620
convenience marked down like that

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,750
doesn't actually just in real mark don't

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,730
let you do like call-outs like tips or

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,839
warnings or don't do this boxes and

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,220
things like that so it's actually very

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,830
much designed for writing documentation

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,420
alongside the code I'm these tools both

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,180
Swift and project dupid are actually

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,610
still really quite new arm and mark down

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,470
isn't the best for a lot of this sort of

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,700
stuff I wouldn't be surprised if in the

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,630
future we see better support for

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,400
different sort of things like

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,570
restructured text or maybe Sphinx you

00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,240
know proper documentation tools

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,410
integrated in but that's a guess so it's

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,990
fun to be gutsy we're gonna summon the

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,180
demo gods that's Paul Fenwick not a demo

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,680
well it might be not sure but we're

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,000
gonna do a demo a live denial we do have

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,910
videos prepared in case they don't work

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
so ah willfully let's be we'll be lucky

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,150
lucky yeah okay so let's do project

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,400
Jupiter first is that that's yep so it's

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:23,330
working yay okay so it hasn't broken so

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,010
far so uh this is a new Jupiter notebook

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,400
specifically to python Jupiter notebook

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,200
running on my laptop right now and let's

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,000
actually start doing this so what I've

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,370
got here is it's broken up sort of into

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,300
blocks I believe the term is it sells I

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,130
never quite remember the correct

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,990
nomenclature which is essentially just

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,150
individual discrete things that you can

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,560
put information and so this is a code

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,240
cell and I can tell that because it says

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,530
the word code here hopefully many of you

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
have seen project Jupiter other parts i

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,630
think has been a couple but first I'll

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,910
taking your legs should be pretty

00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:55,900
familiar ideally if one is less than to

00:12:49,910 --> 00:13:00,410
type in one hand it is hard print logic

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:03,080
checks out which we hope will work or

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,820
else this demo will be terrible um so

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,190
now if we just want to run this we can

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,660
like so and look logic checks out we're

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,290
immediately seeing the results oh yeah

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,000
it didn't break but this isn't just the

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,110
sort of a really cut down parking you

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,030
actually do anything and I'm actually

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,060
going to steal the exact demo from micro

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,260
pi because all sorry Mike reply things

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,350
was really really cool so I'm just going

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,050
to like import mouth here and then I'm

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,220
just going to go like math dot sign all

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,990
that demos are going to take twice as

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,500
long because teams only got one hand 90

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,640
and then again we'll just run this and

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,460
there we go we're immediately seeing the

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,860
output of our resolve it so you know

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,660
that's great you know but you know it's

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,340
not very exciting currently this is no

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,050
better than just using the terminal

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,820
where this sort of gets a little bit

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,560
better so I can change this next block

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,350
down here saying to mark down and then

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,280
goes you know this is some muck down

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,380
hold the bollocks oh yeah that would be

00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,730
nice thank you ah so yeah this is the

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,500
mark down here and you know to prove it

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,390
some mark down i'll make that bold like

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,460
so and then again if we run this block

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,900
we're seeing it being nice and formatted

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,580
and then you can start to see how this

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:16,160
would you know slowly build up so you

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:17,450
know a example of project Jupiter also

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,130
if there's anyone from project Jupiter

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,950
here please tell me why you named it

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,690
this way I'm honestly confused by it uh

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,230
and you know you also didn't actually

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,550
run that one cuz it's in code anyway you

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,900
get the idea basically we have our

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,760
documentation environment here that lets

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,290
us combined mark up with code and add

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,850
our annoyed and you know I can move

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,230
things up and down to get it looking the

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,390
way I want and then in theory you could

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,920
actually you know bundle this up send it

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,140
to someone in the head start using this

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,060
for actually learning from which is

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,140
nothing so revolutionary are and it's

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,520
been something you could always do but

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,080
it's starting to be used in more

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,670
interesting ways so now I'm going to go

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,330
to something called regex golfy and this

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,890
is um the project oriole or how are you

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,660
know pronounce X this is a thing made by

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,010
Riley Riley does publish our books this

00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,690
is nothing to do with anything we do

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,100
with O'Reilly so we're not showing off

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,480
anything or advertising for them this is

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,370
just the best implementation that we

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,630
found of actually taking the project do

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,940
put a technology and using it for a

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,790
product that involves documentation and

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,410
code um so this is essentially trying to

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,740
teach a bit about regex and a bit about

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,110
python and it does so with peter norvig

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,420
explaining regex along the way so it's

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,550
taking the joke from XKCD hopefully

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,740
that's visible does it run here no XKCD

00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,810
that's I'm making an assumption that I

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,790
think it's a safe one and the idea is

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,680
can you make what's the shortest regex

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,020
you can make that will correctly

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,769
identify every winner of the u.s.

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,649
election

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,939
is but no losers and you know it's

00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,399
broken up into chunks who are actually

00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:42,110
getting texts here explaining I'm not

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,610
going to risk it on the Wi-Fi even

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,290
though it has actually been super solid

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,610
so far I'm not going to try playing the

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,649
video as well but the video is actually

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,149
time synced so depending on where you're

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,069
scrolling it'll be playing the

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,689
appropriate part of the video um which

00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:55,699
is kind of cool but again I'm not gonna

00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:57,079
risk I'm not going to push the demo gods

00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,489
that far if anyone is a demo God is

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,049
probably Peter Norman but yeah that's

00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,860
true he's actually pretty good so it's

00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,089
going through here and we're actually

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,589
you know it's building up in chunks

00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,809
first we're getting the list of winners

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,009
and losers of us elections and so on so

00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,839
forth yeah i'm just gonna scroll right

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,980
down at the bottom here because let's

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,689
just see if it actually works but boom

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,309
so i'm going to run this one here it's

00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:20,389
going to spin up a jupiter notebook for

00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:23,029
us he says it's gonna spin up a job in

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,410
jupiter notebook for us and this work

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,850
every time while we tested it but we

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,189
doing a video it doesn't work I think

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:33,709
it's not working let's refresh the page

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:35,569
I did learn something give us a second

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,529
it's much cooler live yeah so we'll just

00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,850
try this once more then we'll play the

00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:42,139
video it doesn't work but that would be

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,910
sad it would be very sad so you're

00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,699
nearly there Tim where are we scroll

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,799
faster go faster Tim ok so we run this

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,720
here styling server spinning up it's

00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,499
doing stuff it's gonna work you can give

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,209
it a few seconds yeah yeah come on

00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:57,980
working ok so crash because I didn't run

00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:59,600
the ones above it which does make sense

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,420
i'm just gonna run all the ones above it

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,610
we give it a second and to that there's

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,169
our regex to correctly identify every

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,850
single and if you're really good at reg

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:12,260
axes in your head you can quickly verify

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:13,459
that um not ok we'll just see what

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,889
working the great thing about this is

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,579
it's live it's its interactive we can

00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:21,289
change it so we gave this talk at right

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,610
the docs or variant on this tour I the

00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,380
docs in Portland and we thought you know

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,750
what the hell we'll make it funny will

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,740
add Trump in the list of winners but

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,730
that's not funny anymore um

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,610
so we're not going to do that this time

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,530
instead I'm going to ever selected all

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,980
the text correctly there I'm going to

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,650
paste in instead the wrong thing because

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,780
that's what you always do so we're

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,280
prepared an Australian specific example

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,840
for you but doesn't involve anyone

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,030
having to think about Trump so we

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:56,150
thought they would be preferable okay so

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,680
here we've got now a list of every prime

00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,390
minister who's won an election in

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,580
Australia and every leader opposition

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,980
who has lost an election in Australia

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,360
and now we can start running this sort

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,370
of stuff again we can go down piece by

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,060
piece we can see who has both won and

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,740
lost an election ah really big in

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,140
Australia it turns out um so I learned

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,060
something new there you go and now we

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,950
can see who has just lost an election

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,330
and I just really should probably

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:24,710
actually put in a print here so we can

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:29,360
actually see that dunno whoops so it's

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:30,770
hard to see the screen here so we've

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,880
basically got this great environment

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,560
where we can do live code alongside

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,120
documentation we're kind of missing the

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,980
ability to add your own notes in this

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,360
particular implementation but it's still

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,500
such a solid actual product

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,000
implementation of something that you

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,590
could do with this technology that we

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,090
felt it was too good not to demo and yet

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,920
it turns out there's only 10 people who

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,560
have ever only just lost an election as

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,760
a leader of opposition which i think is

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,740
good probably said something about a

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,180
political system anyway you know if you

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,560
keep going down and showing this i'm

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,050
just going to actually comment out one

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,480
little thing in here that's actually us

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,090
specific or rather the history of US

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,080
president specific and then if i go

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,370
right down here again run again we'll

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,770
get a new regex which you can also

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,000
verify and that's our new regex which

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,830
again if you just want to quickly do it

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,960
in your head this will correctly

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,270
identify every australian prime minister

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,160
who's won election and not identify any

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,130
leader of opposition who has lost an

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,320
election um so obviously this is a

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,030
slightly weird example and you'll

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,560
probably not ever use this this but it

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,290
does really show this sort of this power

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,240
here we've got this you've got full

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,890
documentation explaining what's going on

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,440
with code that you can modify and change

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,730
live how you want when you want and you

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,900
can see the results as you're going

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,210
through and it's all sort of broken up

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,340
and we even have a video here with a an

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,640
expert explaining what's going on along

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,810
side now um the next thing we'll do is

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,000
we'll just quickly sort of show

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,470
legislate grounds lift is the thing

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,790
we're more experience with and Swift

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,440
playgrounds is a different approach on

00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,780
the same thing as we've kind of alluded

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,070
to this is a smoke playground apple

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,290
provides to demonstrate the power of

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,820
playgrounds it's demonstrating Newton's

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:08,840
Cradle which is the popular executive

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,180
toy amongst many other things and that's

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,040
it there and the idea the entire idea is

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,230
trying to teach you both UI kit which is

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,510
Apple's you know interface framework and

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,560
also physics at the same time and you

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,780
can actually see we've got this sort of

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,310
like rich text here that's explaining

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,680
what's going on and so on fourth and you

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,390
can actually sort of turn that off we're

00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,620
going to the menu and tell from the the

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,540
rendering of the markup you'll see it is

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,910
actually just it's just normal imagine

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,080
plus Swift mixed together so the thing

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,370
knows how to render in a pretty fashion

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,230
and the little defect like it's showing

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,600
colors at the top of colors is just the

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,920
idea being helpful yeah um the great

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,510
thing about this is because again it's

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,860
sort of this interactive environment we

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,420
can change it we can sort of figure out

00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,370
what happens if you screw around with

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,940
physics it's a ball swinging but ok so

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,920
we'll set the balls mean tim is making

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,060
the noise not the playground yeah that's

00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,070
actually quite impressed in their work

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,250
um so let's sort of play around a little

00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,650
bit this what happens if say we mess

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,390
with magnet you agree with your new

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,700
knowledge of um they're called

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,550
physicists I think physicist although

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,580
but we're not here to show you physics

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:14,150
you here to show you the playground so

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:16,340
put that 250 nothing good girl don't

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,590
don't don't talk talk and you know while

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,620
that's going let's let's change the

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,490
elasticity to say a hundred because if

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,880
you're going to do something you may as

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,110
well do something stupid and there we go

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,850
and yet we're immediately seeing the

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,980
results of it turns out if you make

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,230
things really elastic they bounce a lot

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,400
so we could go like copy and paste some

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,800
of the colors at the top in the array of

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,210
balls and we could add more balls and so

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,860
on and so forth pretty much anything we

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,750
want to do works and this is just a

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,190
reasonably simple file that it just

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,650
happens to it I'm just going to have

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,030
this ability to combine code

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,080
documentation and your own night school

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,120
so Tim wanted to go in there he had a

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,250
comment to himself about something he

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,780
could and it would be persisted there um

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,860
ok so we don't have to show any of a

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,390
video so we're just going to really

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,170
quickly skip through all of these slides

00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,190
with videos on

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:03,470
yeah worked um so something really cool

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,290
is that um this is actually a video is

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,740
that playing play we go there we go I'm

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,390
of the playgrounds that are just coming

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,880
for ipad they're not actually available

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,950
yet unless you're a developer but soon

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,220
they'll be available on iOS 10 which is

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:22,070
a really cool thing I think because a

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,960
lot more people own iPads then laptops

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,610
or developers especially with children

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,540
it's a great way to learn code and this

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,370
is something that it's deliberately

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,500
designed for it so playgrounds for Mac

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,210
on xcode a design for actual you know

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,700
work or learning of documentation play

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,980
games on ipad a design for documentation

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,990
and kids to learn so they come with all

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,400
sorts of cool frameworks in

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,140
infrastructure to teach kids programming

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,310
where there's this beautifully visual

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,600
world and there's things you can do to

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,590
make the character we move around in the

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,880
world the world will look here in a

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,560
moment assuming the video actually works

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,390
and there we go and you can give this

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,250
this character commands and slowly learn

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,420
Swift as its build up over this as you

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,800
said paginate an environment that's

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,110
running a real programming language that

00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,460
has documentation alongside it actually

00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,960
knows what it's doing unless you put

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,700
notes and all sorts of stuff so here the

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,070
adding the commands to actually collect

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,300
the gym and you can run it and then the

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,400
little chap will move forward and click

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,360
the gym and then the next lesson and so

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,520
on and so on until you've actually been

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,990
tricked into learning programming it's

00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,340
pretty powerful stuff we think and we

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,360
think it's gonna be really interesting

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,230
to see what this little stuff goes we'd

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,300
love to see it happen with more

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,270
languages though I'll see if we'll just

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,530
move on so we've shown you a whole bunch

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,120
of different things we're going to try

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,860
and tie together and hopefully figure

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,230
out what's the point of all of these

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,530
different things is so let's look at

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,000
some strengths um okay so in theory

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,890
we've actually had all this stuff for a

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,780
while like none of these tools are super

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,160
new all the principles of them are not

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,200
serving you but people finally signed up

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,030
but the main strengths is your coding

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,550
your documentation is literally together

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,220
um that there is no separation between

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,990
the two it is the same thing and also

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,910
you've got notes written by the person

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,170
trying to learn what the documentation

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,660
is telling you written there so you've

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,220
got official documentation your own mad

00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,320
scribblings of oh my god this makes no

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,670
sense in the code and you can change

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,860
things on the fly like like we do with

00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,450
the physics women super bouncy you can

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,850
do that and you can immediately see the

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,430
result and finally you've also got mixed

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,080
media arm because having a video of an

00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,410
expert alongside going hey this is how

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,780
it is or even having em

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,760
and it me should now look like this you

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,560
know oh god mine doesn't look like or if

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,150
you're a child learning to program on an

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,440
iPad in Swift playgrounds you can draw

00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,550
something and then shove your drawing of

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,930
how you figured out how some data

00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,990
structure worked alongside the rest of

00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,400
your life and so on and so forth so

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,140
those are the main strengths about it

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,600
are primarily it's this you can mix

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,370
notes code and documentation so that

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,110
people actually really like this and use

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,110
this in their learning surprised us when

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,940
we first started noticing it we've found

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,410
people really really love being able to

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,580
do this and we teach a lot of live

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,380
programming courses and this is a quote

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,560
from one of their courses a few months

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,180
ago where somebody ratted out of us at

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,040
length about how during the course which

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,650
is entirely playground based as we teach

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,820
them Swift they really found it handy to

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,500
be a ton and lots of people said this

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,090
they found how did you go to mix their

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,350
notes about what they were thinking and

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,360
how they were learning the topic with

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,740
the actual examples and notes that we

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,220
provided them as well as the tutorial

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,600
for how things should work and yeah we

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,670
really aggressive about asking for

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,080
feedback from our participants and it

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:14,670
usually works so we get gems like this

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,290
occasionally again academics so there's

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,570
a couple of weaknesses of the way things

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,980
work currently and we haven't got too

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,490
long left but will quickly dance through

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:27,240
these so really they only support

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,410
markdown kind of an HTML kind of most of

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,410
them support some sort of twisted

00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,660
variant on those but it's mostly good

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,260
enough for now we'd like to see more

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,240
markups and more different ways to

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,310
display fancy texts they are kind of

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,100
crashy and so if playgrounds relies on

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,990
loading like half of llvm but it does

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,970
work and jupiter notebooks is some sort

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,920
of intricate nest of presenting

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,540
proportions to actually make it run it

00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,280
run once it runs it kind of works mostly

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,390
as well this is what I'm really excited

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,770
for the ipad version of Swift

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,540
playgrounds because you just install an

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,240
app and then it works hope you'll

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,350
probably still crash though they

00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,670
obviously have limited language and

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,080
framework support as well playgrounds

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,060
only works as Swift probably only will

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,200
ever work with Swift has Apple open

00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,730
source more bits of it though people

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,710
will surely be I'd actually make it work

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,880
with our languages and Jupiter notebooks

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,440
works with lots of things but has really

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,450
been in being only been embraced by the

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,590
Python in our communities for whatever

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,870
reason so we'd like to see more

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,330
languages do this because we think it's

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,650
pretty powerful ah one really big

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,450
negative is now these hooking to

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,830
documentation tools like Sphinx or

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,300
whatever or any of the big documentation

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,190
system so people are writing these gore

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,540
beautiful manuals that don't have any

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,680
support for anything like this and we'd

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,600
like to see more interlinking there

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,340
between systems to write manuals and

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,830
documentation API guidelines and API

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,240
references and the actual ways you can

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,760
learn the language you'll be using those

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,140
things in and they only really work for

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,460
narrative content so content where

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,350
you're going from step one to step five

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,630
and their sins path in between that you

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,940
need to learn it doesn't really work as

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,770
well in the same way for things like AP

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,030
is where you have small discreet things

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,710
your Butler on I have seen some API

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,970
documentation where there's a lot of

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,590
small examples and you can run them live

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,970
in the browser but it's really not the

00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,140
same context so the tools don't really

00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,850
have the support for that I'm like a

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,600
mascot likes with playgrounds and

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,610
Jupiter notebooks um okay so what's next

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,130
with these things or what do we think is

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,770
going to be next with these things um so

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,560
the first one is the the clever boffins

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,030
will actually fix the tech they're both

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,120
pretty good but they are both still

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,830
pretty crashy at the same time it'll be

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,360
easy to add a new language and projects

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,610
this is something project Jupiter seems

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,840
to be heavily focusing on it's very good

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,230
they're trying to make it so that it

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,370
isn't just ipython really they're trying

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,690
to make it such very easy for other

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,780
people to add a new support for

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,790
different stuff and kudos from to do so

00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,350
we think or hope this will replace books

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:39,540
like would it be great if instead of

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,550
buying a technical book and I says as an

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,900
author instead of buying a technical

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,130
book that someone has written it's a

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,380
technical book that someone's written

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,760
where you can actually run the code as

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,500
you're going through and actually see

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,990
the results and make changes live then

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,000
and there and also articles so things

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,110
like oriole where I think it's instead

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
of writing your blog post but hey I

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,230
solve this really weird bug in Django to

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,260
be hey I solved this really weird bug

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,510
and Django and see me do it live will

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,850
get better support for non-narrative

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,470
documentation um there's no reason you

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,970
couldn't just embed things like project

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,500
you put a straight into your api docs

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,850
for your own frameworks and projects

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,400
it's just currently it'll be a bit weird

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,170
and you have to do a lot of work I think

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,460
that will change over time and you'll

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,840
get better integration with video and

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,550
screen showing we didn't show it off in

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,800
Oriole but it does have that time synced

00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:25,260
jumping video thing which is really cool

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,670
but it is a can it's a little bit buggy

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,040
because it's YouTube and YouTube is

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,480
annoying at the best of time so i think

00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,950
you'll see better integration with that

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,090
sort of basically we have the existing

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,830
technology to do all of these things

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,870
it's just nobody's really using them in

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,420
this way and

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,650
lots of both anecdotal and actual data

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,120
suggests that people will learn better

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,510
they can combine these things so we

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,559
should probably be doing it if you want

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,059
to actually poke around these things

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,140
anymore there's some fairly obvious ways

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,640
you can do it if you're on a mac

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,260
download xcode from the app store if you

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,370
have an app store account which if it's

00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,510
an apple account you do and that's free

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,040
you don't any other accounts it'll just

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,150
work then you can play in playgrounds

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,559
play guys will literally be the first

00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,330
button Xcode presents you with when you

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,890
open it that's how can Apple is about

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,090
these things at the moment if you've got

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,680
an iPad you can install one of the

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,000
public betas or betas of aisles 10 and

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,040
play with playgrounds line and right now

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,270
or you can wait four to eight weeks

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,860
depending on what Apple does something

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,200
and everyone we got to get it it's

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,340
pretty cool if you on something else or

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,080
do I wanna play with Swift download

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,670
Jupiter notebooks it is complicated and

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,050
reasonably poorly documented to set it

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,130
up last time we said project you were

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,300
just probably documented that turns it

00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,830
the person who wrote must have doctors

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,590
in the audience hope that hasn't

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,610
happened again truly it astounding

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,500
effort because the documentation is

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,790
mammoth but it needs to be easy to set

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,309
up and that's not really your fault as a

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:32,900
documentarian you can also go to try doc

00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,580
Jupiter organ try it online which is

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,630
mostly works and it's pretty fun and

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,720
doesn't require you actually having to

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,710
do anything O'Reilly RL is a really cool

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,940
thing to look at as well you can check

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,590
out the thing we played with there as

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,030
well as an article and why they did this

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,550
which mostly matches up with our

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,960
philosophy on why we think people should

00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,240
be doing this for the documentation so

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,650
maybe check that out that's pretty much

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,450
everything so we're about half an hour

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,300
in now there's maybe 10 minutes till the

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,280
next session if you have any questions

00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,990
we've got time I think otherwise you can

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,850
find us on Twitter in this one tim is

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,370
the horse again and i mopped the horse

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,929
again we'll put slides and notes online

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,220
on our various websites later and

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,929
there's also an earlier version which is

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,370
not quite the same torque on that your

00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,809
teacher bureau which will tweet after

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,520
this with the park on a you tag as well

00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,520
so thank you very much

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:28,320
okay thank you Tim and Paris many

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:37,590
questions hit me no questions okay

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:40,950
Walter yeah hi thanks so much for that

00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:44,010
um you just mentioned something about

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:48,600
the Swift playgrounds on the iOS

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:52,500
platform and you said wait for it so

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,970
it's still experimental so it's it's

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,220
currently available in the public beta

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,600
of iOS 10s of you google for iOS 10

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,799
public beta there's a page on apple's

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,690
website where you can sign up for that

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,549
and get it straight away there's no like

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,519
approval process so if you want to run

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:08,250
up potentially buggy OS on your iPad you

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,720
can use it right now but if you wait

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,010
four to eight weeks that's apples

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,419
traditional release time frame in

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,700
september-october for a new version of

00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,289
iOS and there is a new version of ours

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,220
currently being tested tested so we can

00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:19,320
assume it will come out there and if you

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:26,090
want the stable public version thank you

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,090
no worries yeah anyone else back then

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,380
and how useful do you think it'd be for

00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,669
onboarding experienced programmers into

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,600
companies where you need a lot of domain

00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,940
knowledge that you wouldn't necessarily

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,470
have I think that would be amazing i'm

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,940
one of the companies i used to work for

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,230
we used to do simulations as part of the

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,450
interview process where we just give

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,269
them a task and ask them to build

00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,690
something through like a day or two and

00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,950
pay them for the for the privilege so

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,240
one of the big forms we have was getting

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,350
them up to speed on the AP is that we

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,250
would have liked them to use and I think

00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,320
something like this where they could

00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,820
step through the series of examples and

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
run them with the documentation would be

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,309
a really good way of bringing people to

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,139
speak with something so yes that would

00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:11,659
be great thanks please do that yeah any

00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:11,659
other questions yep

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,410
are there any sort of clever and elegant

00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,940
ways to put the data inside the switch

00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,680
playgrounds or inside the Jupiter

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,180
notebooks so that you don't have so that

00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,770
you can just have really one file that

00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,600
you're trying to distributor on so you

00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,280
can hide you could there's a mock-up

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,990
remember I said it's kind of knocked

00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,490
down but not there are some knockdown h

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,170
tags you can use in at least the Swift

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,220
playgrounds one that will let you blow

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,450
up in a whole bunch of library code

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,190
that's not visible in the rendered

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,450
version so you can ship this like

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,130
beautiful looking thing that has all

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,080
your horrible secrets hidden at the top

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,240
or at the bottom so you couldn't then

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,340
run like the you can do the same shooter

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,780
okay so like the the alien little alien

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,520
dude running around in the ipad version

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,660
that has a whole bunch of basically it's

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,790
got a game engine sitting under there

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,290
that you can't see that if you show copy

00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:59,500
those files onto a mac and looked at the

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,700
unrendered markup you would see several

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,870
thousand lines of a game engine to

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,070
render the world and then only the bits

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,660
needed to make the thing move around the

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,740
world so yes you can do that and you can

00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,730
ship library files along sides

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:14,770
individual files and then load them in

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:17,980
yep anyone else nope okay well that

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:20,290
concludes one more thing guys on behalf

00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,929
of bike on australia i'd like to present

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:25,650
you a small gift for your time a round

00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:25,650
