Title: How digital agencies can invest in open-source products without going broke or insane
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2016
Description:

Compared to single-project software teams, digital agencies face the challenges of having to balance limited capacity amongst competing clients and projects, which makes it difficult to find time between the billable hours to invest.

However, agencies also have a whole lot to gain from building reusable code - chiefly scalability. If an agency's reusable code can become a product that offers value to clients, then agencies can move beyond hourly-rate pricing towards value-based pricing.

But creating products is expensive and risky, and open-sourcing products is even more so, until the benefits start accumulating.

This talk covers learnings from our 7 years as a Python/Django web agency, moving from using open source to contributing and creating it; what guides our investment decisions, and why some decisions worked and some didn't, and how our philosophy has shifted as a result.

soft this morning we have dr. Greg

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,570
Turner he's the CEO of interaction

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,349
consortium a user-centric web agency in

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,210
Melbourne and Sydney and he's also

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,690
serving on the Code of Conduct committee

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:22,470
of the general software foundation thank

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:27,029
you for that thanks about this he's

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:29,580
going to give us a talk about guys about

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,099
how digital agencies can invest in

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:43,829
open-source products without going broke

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:45,840
or insane thanks thanks Ariel today is

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,120
actually my last day as CEO of the

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,270
interaction consortium so since the

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,680
thanks and since the since the

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,440
conference program was published I

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,109
actually demoted myself to head of

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,570
product and strategy and we've hired

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,430
someone far better to be the boss of us

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,220
or so if you're interested about who

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:11,369
that is and why then you can find the

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,920
details on the website so app icon 2010

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,460
I gave a talk called glam get the harder

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,770
better faster stronger way to write

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,680
reusable Django code where I outlined

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,630
the approach we were taking to open

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,030
source our CMS for the cultural sector

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,729
and it turns out I was largely mistaken

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,170
in that talk so if you saw it you should

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,049
come and find me afterwards because I

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,650
believe I owe you a drink or an apology

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,930
or both and so instead today I'd like to

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,270
tell you about what we try and what we

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,009
were trying to do why it didn't work why

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,229
why though why did the approach i

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,939
described in 2010 was faulty and how the

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,899
approach we're taking now is working

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,509
better for us and so you know we've had

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,840
six years since then to get it right and

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,250
I'd say we're most of the way there the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,030
right things appeared to be happening

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,860
and we're not broke or insane but we've

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,959
got a way to go as well so what are we

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,430
trying to do I want to start from the

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,860
beginning and talk about why we're in

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,500
business

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,160
at there's this quote the business is a

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,320
repeatable process that makes money and

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,060
I to me that's kind of true on the face

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,060
of it but it's not really interesting

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,560
from the from the meaning of life for

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,180
late-stage capitalism point of view

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,440
there's there's a bunch of ways to make

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,600
money so why would you pick any

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,940
particular one and the interaction

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,610
consortium is a web agency there cares

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,500
deeply about the cultural impact or the

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,930
impact on society of the work that we do

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,900
and when we started the IC we knew that

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,580
we wanted to pick and choose our clients

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,440
as much as we could and to be generous

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,660
to them we wanted to take on projects

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,220
with new technical challenges we wanted

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,350
to build sites that made the world a

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,060
better place but as you can imagine with

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,930
these ideals we're not really chasing

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,970
the money in order to make that kind of

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,190
thing work we had to kind of believe in

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,860
what we're doing even if the money you

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,560
know didn't work out and also we had to

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,080
be really good at it so that hopefully

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,820
it did work out and the money would

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,209
derive more or less as a side effect of

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:21,049
of the things we were trying to do so I

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,239
want to tweak what Paul frite said in

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,610
not a terribly original Sittwe way but

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,350
to say for us the business is a

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,690
repeatable process that retains value

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:35,330
and instead of focusing on money a

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,280
business generates new value shares some

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,560
of that value of the world and keep some

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,330
of it as well and so the value could be

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,799
money thing you know financial things

00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,640
but it might be knowledge or it might be

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,450
code or it might be something different

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,310
fun and exciting and so the business

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,280
needs to generate value in a repeatable

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,959
way so that could be many things process

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,000
optimization figuring out your business

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,180
model but for the purposes of this talk

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,640
and this conference and I want to focus

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,709
on we're using our code in a way that

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,450
generates additional value every time we

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:13,010
use it so it's trying to pick the right

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:17,930
flavor of thing to hangout hook on hang

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,970
our hat on values also a more useful

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,919
concept i think the money to apply to

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,380
open source software although russ's

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,010
recent comments notwithstanding so I'm

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,470
going to use gland kit as an example

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,160
down here by the way is our open source

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,140
CMS for the cultural sector glum stands

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,110
for galleries libraries archives and

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,250
museums and it's used by institutions

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,060
like the art gallery of New South Wales

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,400
and mca Australia and SF MoMA in San

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,190
Francisco and it's designed more or less

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
for any organization who lets the public

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,650
in through their doors and so it's built

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,870
on Jango Pilar so python django flu and

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,700
CMS which is what we use for kind of

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,080
dealing with rich content that's a talk

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,150
for another day and and I skill which is

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,580
our kind of internal tools for building

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,820
websites and then we've put the kind of

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,220
museum culture specific stuff around the

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,590
outside and then we wrap it all up in a

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,080
in a docker container for deployment and

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,390
scalability which I'll come back to in a

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,980
moment so we spent many women months

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,530
many hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,440
creating grand kitten imbuing it with

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,630
our experience and our expertise so this

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,390
is its kind of this incredibly valuable

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,640
artifact the code base we know museums

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,740
one and attach a lot of value to those

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,650
things and some of them at least are

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:42,420
willing to pay for it so the question is

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:46,350
why did we decide to open source it last

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,000
year in Brisbane fijaros gave a

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,100
great talk on how to get money moving

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,950
around the open-source ecosystem and

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,720
touched upon it again just now so that

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,280
developers are paid for the time that

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,650
they spend on open source project

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,330
there's rust channeling Donald Trump

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,330
there if you

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,340
that's true that's actual size you so

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,289
you should go and watch that talk like a

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,389
Donald Trump speech it contains several

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,090
ideas that maybe sound appealing but

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,830
don't work for one reason or another

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,460
unlike Donald Trump Russ admits this and

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:27,250
adds a really interesting new idea but I

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,740
think really could work and I think

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,620
still needs to happen which is turning

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:37,870
pypy into a kind of subscription

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:40,810
micropayment distribution platform as a

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,909
web agency we're coming up the same

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,900
problem but from the opposite end where

00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,949
it's not a problem of money where the

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,270
money's not a problem people are paying

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:54,729
us to write code for them we don't have

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,949
an intrinsic lack of money to pay

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,840
developers solve problems like code the

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,819
challenge is whether we can successfully

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,789
bring about a situation where that

00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,830
problem solving and code writing happens

00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:09,370
in an open source environment so in

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,469
other words for a business that needs to

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,870
retain value somewhere the open source

00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:16,060
dilemma is can I retain enough and

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,419
ideally more value by open sourcing my

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,389
software than by keeping it closed if

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,130
you honor if you if you're feeling

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,630
hungry or whatever or feeling bit

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,120
hungover you can skip to the end of this

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,469
talk because the answer is yes right

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,469
here's why I think software increases

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,330
its value when you open source it so it

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:40,419
becomes more valuable to more people it

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,340
feels fairly simple and assertion the

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,099
trick for an agency is to make it more

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,020
valuable to you at the same time and you

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,210
can do this on the condition I think

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,029
that your business model doesn't rely on

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,319
licensed for use so to me the sign of a

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,629
good business model is the fault

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,870
tolerance and so that if some you have

00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,789
at least four or five backup plans or

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,639
competitive advantages if if the

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:06,310
environment or the world changes if

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,139
you're only relying on limiting access

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,029
to your code through license fees for

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,940
success then your business model is I

00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:15,039
think not very fault tolerant the the

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,899
lack of license fee profit for us would

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,990
be more than made up for by the increase

00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,970
in market size and momentum

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,000
the built around an open source product

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,310
and the the cultural sectors

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,890
increasingly moving towards free and

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,150
open source software and so every signal

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,850
we get tells us that will get more

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,070
clients with glam kit open and closed in

00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,200
fact museums are beginning to insist on

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,720
it here's a section from a client

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,110
agreement that we signed last year the

00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,420
key points are you will open source all

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,010
the code and if you don't you'll pay as

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,110
money and you know I was kind of under

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,790
lard about signing up to pay money but I

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,920
was like yeah I you know of course we're

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,260
going to do this we believe in it why

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,460
wouldn't I commit to doing this and you

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,410
know if you don't think you or your

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,040
company will find time to open source

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:09,480
sign a contract like this because it's

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:12,060
incredibly motivating there's another

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,500
cost which is that by open sourcing

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,700
we're signing ourselves up to maintain

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,890
the software so what is if sorry the

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,930
maintenance verdun burden of glam kit

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,970
exceeds the time that we have to do it

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,040
once it's open source so there at least

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,070
two approaches we take as a company to

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,990
tackle that problem one is we're a web

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,330
agency we connect developers with money

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,510
and we're in a position to compensate

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,010
people for working on the project so and

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,930
given that we're already going to be

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,670
maintaining something that we invest in

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,580
you know it doesn't matter whether it

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,020
happens here or here the second and kind

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,960
of more powerful thing is that

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,700
communities scaling opportunities so if

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,130
grand kitt starts being seen as

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,740
something like wordpress for museums and

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,720
starts getting that kind of ecosystem

00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,310
around it then more people are going to

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,030
show up with more resources to

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,670
contribute us you know the hope of every

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,590
open source project so in that situation

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,830
the demand on our time is going to be

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:14,010
quite high but spending that time not

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,740
writing code and and closing tickets as

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,260
much as helping others in the community

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,980
and helping people get involved and on

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,890
boards and understanding the path we're

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,620
on it's much more effective than doing

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,030
the work on our own so we might not get

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,900
paid for any of that we might not get

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,820
paid as an agency to help other p

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,040
maintain an improved gland kit but even

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,260
in the worst case we'll we're in a

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,810
position where we can share in the

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:45,850
resulting value and the third reason why

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,470
we might be reluctant open source is

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,650
isn't directly to do with money it's

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,960
because it's kind of embarrassing it is

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,420
it there's a moment of vulnerability as

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,850
a web agency and that's because if you

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,670
look at the the motivational landscape

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,400
for a traditional web agency model there

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,380
isn't a lot motivating us to write good

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,630
quality code on the shame to admit if

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,360
you have to hit a deadline or a budget

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,580
then a quick solution is this is a good

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,530
solution if you're creating stuff that

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,780
is only going to be used by one client

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,760
whatever works for that client it's fine

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,770
if you're paid by the hour there's a

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,240
motivation to kind of get our numbers up

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:29,950
the more you can build a better so that

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:33,810
leaves developers with like very it kind

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:36,450
of puts developers in a very difficult

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:39,280
motivational landscape they're left with

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,260
intrinsic motivation to write good code

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,930
if you're a developer who cares about

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,700
her art then writing good code is just

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,860
the right thing to do but in a

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,490
traditional web agency all of those

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,370
factors are against you and this will

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,800
changes once you start reusing code so

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,240
obviously when you reuse code it helps

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,010
maximize the chance of delivering on

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,250
time and within budget and the whole

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,660
kind of risk goes down and by the way if

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,850
you're wondering why your web agency

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,340
can't hang on to developers or deliver

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,690
projects on time and within budget

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,940
chances are is because you're not

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,220
reusing your code enough you should

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,560
contact you should constrain your market

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,810
in that case so that you're only working

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,300
for clients where you have a chance to

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,640
reuse your code and if you have clients

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,720
who wear that doesn't work and I want

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,740
something done differently to everyone

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,740
else then

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,540
it's the investment time into a passing

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:37,870
so then we're offsetting the cost of

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,850
Dana we're so even if you're building by

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,890
the hours that like clients are going to

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,079
use you less if you're working faster

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,880
more efficiently buoys and code since

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,579
then delivering the same work in few

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,290
hours it becomes more hope and because

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:54,459
we're retaining barrier as a business we

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,680
get to keep more of that and so of

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,910
course if you're reusing code then you

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,610
mail it to be as good quality as

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,390
possible and I don't think I need to

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,550
justify rate strongly that open sourcing

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:10,839
it is a is a great way to improve the

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,610
engineering quality of your code so i

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,380
think that vulnerability the moment of

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,709
in the moment of open sourcing is worth

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,510
it for for a web agency glam kit for

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:22,390
example is in a pretty good place but

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,890
it's not perfect and rather than being

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,079
embarrassed by the imperfection I'd

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,870
rather we use it as an opportunity to

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,550
learn and share knowledge and and

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:38,890
improve which is I guess the open-source

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:40,959
way and so more than that by being in

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,779
pub being thing bombo in public you're

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,310
demonstrating your kind of belief that

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,600
what you're doing is is the right thing

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:51,040
to do which brings me to this the open

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,430
sourcing your software is an act of

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,800
leadership so it's easier to convince

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,750
people to adopt open standards than

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,730
closed standards but but more than that

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,500
it's a statement that you believe so

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,720
much in the idea and you're so clearly

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,130
at the forefront of what you're doing

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
that you're not worried about

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,110
competitors stealing your ideas or

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,360
creating barriers to entry so you can

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,190
make money from doing that the most

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,860
important thing is that the idea is

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,490
shared by the community and takes root

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:26,320
within that community so I'm coming to

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:28,570
to why I was wrong in 2010 I I said in

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,370
that talk that that our cultural sector

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,250
clients all have similar but uniquely

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,529
different needs which is true and the

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,560
conclusion I reached was that therefore

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,449
we needed to abstract out the common

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,470
functionality from our clients from the

00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:45,900
from the CMS so that when we start our

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,060
it's returning things on rather than

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,720
fighting against the kind of pre-built

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,930
one size fits all kind of CMS approach

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,120
so for example every museum has events

00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:01,080
of some kinds now have different shapes

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,520
and flavors to each other and I thought

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,070
gland kid shouldn't enforce any

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,720
decisions apart from specifying that an

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,610
event has the times in the place and

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,100
maybe a name and what we're trying to

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,910
guard against in 2010 was the kind of

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,780
frustration you get with with a

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,030
particularly complex Drupal or WordPress

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,220
project where you're installing modules

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,610
and they nearly do what you want but not

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,290
quite and you want it not to do this one

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,540
little thing and the next thing you know

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,230
you're drowning in a mess of spaghetti

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:33,570
code and I I think on reflection

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,670
spaghetti that kind of situation the

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,770
spaghetti code is less a consequence of

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,590
anything architectural about a

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,660
general-purpose CMS but more it's more a

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,670
question of project product match to

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,400
market so WordPress and Drupal aren't

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,320
particularly designed for museums so

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,300
they're not a great fit for a complex

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,790
museum website without a lot of in

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,980
plug-in installation and customization

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,480
it's a wordpress out and Drupal out of

00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,760
logs they don't care about events or

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,230
collections or sponsors or whether cafe

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,840
is glam kidding 2010 got round this

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,520
problem by caring about everything that

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,240
a museum cared about but not actually

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,950
doing anything about it so it provided

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,820
these kind of latent possibilities in

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,290
the form of abstract mix-ins but and you

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,840
ended up with really clean and elegant

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,450
and well architected code but debugging

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,190
was complex the code bases complex took

00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:30,150
a pretty long time to get there it

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,100
wasn't compellingly quicker or easier

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,020
than starting from scratch unless you

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,870
worked at the IC and you're interested

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,870
in sharing the code amongst your project

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:48,180
ok all my notes yet so here's what we're

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,640
doing instead firstly we've been around

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,800
the block a bunch of times since 2010

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,420
we've got a really good idea of what

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,360
works in a museum website and what

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,750
doesn't and we've seen that if you start

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,000
working software that is a museum

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,949
website and it's designed to be hacked

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,410
on then it's a much lower barrier to

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,990
entry than starting from a bunch of

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:14,400
really good mix-ins that don't that I've

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,890
turned off so these days glam kits super

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,990
opinionated but open to negotiation

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:24,449
there are layers of opinion nation

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:27,959
opinionated pneus so for example basic

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:30,929
content tools a must-have events come as

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,410
a hackable kind of proof of concept app

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,870
a pattern and collections museum

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,600
collections opt-in abstract patterns

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,770
because they really differ and

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,390
third-party integrations of this stage

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,919
we're just saying it was mostly BYO

00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,690
we've got a couple of things that we've

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:53,280
done that we're sharing and it's very

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,530
cute yeah and we're wrapping all of that

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,030
up this this is something we did this

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:01,250
year we're wrapping all of that up in a

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:05,730
stack of docker containers for Django

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,870
postgres and yep sorry Django there was

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,510
a postgres one in there somewhere

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,460
elastic and Redis and we're sharing

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,220
those as well I think the postgres one

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,770
is the plain vanilla price courtesy

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,410
image and and so this might be an

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,679
unusual stars to take like it's normal

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,270
for for what we've been doing up until

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,530
then is just releasing the thing where

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,030
we're and we're making the change and so

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,010
so why are we releasing the whole

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,190
stackers as in this kind of open source

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:38,460
product and why don't we focus on just

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,740
what we do differently well going back

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,799
to what I was saying about open sourcing

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,630
being an active leadership if you make

00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,760
this gesture of leadership and and

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,710
belief in the potential of what you're

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,169
doing you can show people that the idea

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,620
works then people become willing to

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,270
change their process or thinking to fit

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,419
in with your with with what you're

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,390
asking them to do but then the challenge

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,640
becomes less about the idea and more

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,070
about the pragmatics all of the other

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,210
decisions that get in the way of being

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,460
able to install a

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,290
the Python cns so remember our

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,020
competition is WordPress and Drupal I

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:20,170
museums have this kind of big attraction

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,050
towards low barrier to entry general

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,610
purpose CMS's and they've commoditized

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,920
how staying they've lived they've made

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,740
it really easy to to get up and running

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,510
so someone might I really like the idea

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,580
of glam kit but coming from that

00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:37,210
WordPress world if you ask them to win

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,370
pip install Django and instead of engine

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,550
X and postgres and Redis and elastic

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,640
before you can even get started then

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:48,310
you've lost them so we're sharing our

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,840
knowledge as a web agency you build

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,210
websites all day every day this is how

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,900
we do things if if you're a museum is

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,450
got one site and really doesn't want to

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,800
reinvent the kind of question of how

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,390
you're going to host your museum website

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,130
you could just do this it takes three

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,570
lines to get grand kitt running on

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,180
docker by the way I think we can get it

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,750
down to two and one of those lines

00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,460
downloads or scripts and runs it that

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,320
having that kind of consistent full

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,770
stack will save us a whole bunch of

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:28,510
support time and kind of platform

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:32,020
specific problem shooting now I've said

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,910
a lot about how an agency can approach

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,820
open sourcing its core product in a way

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:40,260
that allows the agency to retain some

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:45,580
value from that in a repeatable way and

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:48,400
how they might grow a resource and

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,620
vibrant community around it so that

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,200
hopefully covers how we might avoid

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,610
going broke and take care of that side

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,080
of things but I haven't said much yet

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,100
about how not to go insane largely

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,990
because I don't have all the answers

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:07,180
here but I want to share a couple of

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:08,860
things that I found helpful firstly

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,090
there's there's a whole conference about

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,820
mental health and open source

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,860
communities so that the OS feels

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,650
conference is called they just had their

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,500
2016 session and I'm looking forward to

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,980
seeing the videos from that but in 2015

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:28,210
Jacob Kaplan bus and the DSF had a

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,400
a really powerful talk about burnout and

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,549
his relationship with the open source

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,370
community and burnout as Russell saying

00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:39,490
as endemic in our community here is

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,419
again some of you may remember that in

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:46,809
PyCon 2016 in Melbourne I think it was

00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:48,730
russ gave a keynote way where he briefly

00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,470
covered the connection that connection

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,299
between the funding model of open source

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,919
and the mental health issues caused by

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,510
not having any money and having a whole

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,470
bunch of pressures on your time and

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,790
that's made this section a whole lot

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,720
shorter so I'm actually gonna finish

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:08,290
early thanks Russ I tried to get a photo

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,700
of the Trump hand gesture but I think

00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:13,030
that i think the slide covers it this

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,679
time and the most useful thing I think I

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,760
have to add from from a web agency

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,980
perspective is don't go it alone i think

00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,190
is risky to your mental health if you're

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,730
open sourcing code as a unsupported

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,460
individual and their companies who rely

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,020
and build upon open source projects some

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,360
of them fund it some of them are

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,309
criminally negligent ones the russ was

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,330
referring to and you probably know

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:45,429
companies in both of those categories

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,740
and many many places in between so i

00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:49,720
would suggest i know maybe it's

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,220
practical maybe it's not if you're

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,580
thinking about pants or singh a project

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,150
and maybe consider approaching one of

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,900
these companies and ask them to

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:03,760
patronize the project to kind of and

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,720
become a caretaker of the project for

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,890
you so that they have your back and I

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,799
don't know what that looks like maybe

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,200
it's you know some resourcing some

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,600
guarantees but at least that the company

00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,590
has put its public name to the public

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,960
code and has a by doing so has a vested

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:27,630
interest in making sure it you know

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,840
lives and grows and is generally healthy

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:34,630
the kinds of sums that are meaningful in

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,909
terms of ensuring longevity of an open

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,900
source project and the health of open

00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,940
source ecosystem

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,580
much easier for companies defined in

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,380
individuals and I think companies not

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,160
individuals should be bearing the burden

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:53,260
of looking after the things that the

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:58,090
companies are benefiting from and third

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,290
talk I'm citing from Russ the there's a

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,580
talk from last year called I am a doctor

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:05,740
but where where it goes where it covers

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,530
more resources for event for preventing

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:13,710
and treating mental health issues in in

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:18,640
open source communities and so that's a

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:21,010
great reference and there's some really

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:27,000
good tools in there for four to have in

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:29,860
your in your arsenal just in case and

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,080
here's a summary list of some things you

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,510
can do to avoid burnout and the main

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,840
thing I want to say though is to take

00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,240
care of yourselves it's important to

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,060
keep an eye out for the signs of burnout

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,250
they they creep up and one of them is

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:50,500
the denial but anything is wrong so

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,360
notice that within yourself and give

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,760
yourself tools for dealing with burnout

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,060
practice them before you start burning

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,500
out so for example make sure you step

00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,710
away from the computer and the phone

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,680
screens get the exercise be home in time

00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:11,800
for dinner with your loved ones and and

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,710
don't go it alone open sourcing software

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,700
is a vulnerable act but it's also I

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,170
think a strong and generous act to bring

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,840
your idea of a better way of doing

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,870
things into the world and that's its own

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,460
reward but in the end that's not the

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,980
reason why we open source not to make

00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,200
money not to become famous but because

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,630
you can't not open source your code it's

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,160
the right thing to do your fellow humans

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:41,590
on this planet and every so often I have

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,660
mini panic attacks about all of the

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,720
little things that still remain to be

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,820
done in glam kit and all of the you know

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,400
complexity that's going on there and the

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,430
different people

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,200
pulling in different directions there's

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,750
big things on the horizon there's things

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,340
that are standing in our way and more

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:03,120
and more of that is happening in public

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,120
now and when that happens I take three

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,970
deep breaths and fill the air flowing

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,400
through my my nose and my into my chest

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,160
and I remember how far we've already

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,900
come over the last six years I look

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,600
around at all of the amazing people

00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,580
who've contributed believed in what

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,030
we're doing and I look at the horizon

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,740
and remember how a hill you know always

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,750
looks steeper than it really is and it

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,600
always looks further away than it really

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,100
is and sometimes you know that brings

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,010
their energy and the focus that i need

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:39,030
and and i can keep moving and then

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:41,910
sometimes i need to take a rest and so

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,350
good things are happening and it's

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,060
important not to forget that whatever

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,840
happens it's what you make of it the

00:26:45,060 --> 00:27:01,440
matters so take care of yourselves and

00:26:47,840 --> 00:27:03,780
each other thanks thank you Greg I guess

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,120
you take questions if we have a couple

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,130
of minutes please remember that the

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:20,190
question starts with what's like how

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:23,940
what tell me more about my Trump and the

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:26,730
dead you made it better not give me the

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,730
beginning about structuring contracts to

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,950
force you to give back as open source

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,620
and what not there is a world of

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,570
difference though between just open

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,430
sourcing it slapping a BSD license on an

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,930
open sourcing it and actually being a

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,990
project that it's in a position to be

00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,930
actively contributed to so how do you

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:48,780
make the economic business argument to

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,250
spend the extra engineering time to make

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,510
it a project that other people can

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,510
actively contribute to

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,600
excellent question to deal with with a

00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:07,180
hangover you're absolutely right yeah

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,580
there's the error there's you know

00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,370
hitting the red button in github that

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,320
has make the code public and there's the

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:18,610
you know all of the other stuff like

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,560
that's the free thing and so yes we can

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:25,030
tick that box quite easily on the

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:30,400
contract but I think you have to be

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:33,490
coming at it from a from a existing

00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,120
pre-existing belief in the power and

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,520
potential of open source software so um

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,500
there has been times in our history

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,540
where we've gone yes we're using open

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,670
source software and sometimes that meant

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,790
Django or sometimes it's meant you know

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,790
the thing that we look after and and

00:28:50,850 --> 00:29:00,160
take care of ID so this might be a long

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,990
way of saying I don't have a easy answer

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,780
one there are a few things we do I've

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,120
noticed we noticed a few months ago that

00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,430
our github account was basically a kind

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,530
of mess it was it was things we've open

00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,790
sourced and things that we fought and

00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,890
think you know things that we've

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:20,500
abandoned and things the way I was just

00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:22,710
started and and so then we thi ly odd

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,880
our tech lead and I sat down and we

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,560
thought okay we'll make a new get up

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,080
space and everything that goes in this

00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,050
github space we put our way behind so

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,690
it's a small list of things we care very

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:40,270
very much about and those are the things

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:43,240
that comprise I skit glam kit and so it

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:46,810
made a safe space for it a garden I

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:52,360
guess walled garden from the client

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:54,010
point of view and what up what I didn't

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,470
show you in that contract is that

00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,270
they're also insisting that they have to

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:04,780
be using the same code as our other

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:06,640
clients already use so and they know

00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,360
there's some background information

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,880
basically which is that those

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,950
clients orals already invested in open

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,000
sourcing their things and sharing it

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,140
with other people in the museum

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,940
community so so we were under this kind

00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:28,010
of moral pressure to do open sourcing

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,640
properly and to we know we won't get

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:35,480
away with just hitting the button very

00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,890
difficult to for me to be made any more

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,390
clear than that I think at this point

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:45,980
but i'll have a thing and write things

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:50,929
up o our exam unfortunately we are out

00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:53,710
of time thanks Evan thank you again for

00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:53,710
