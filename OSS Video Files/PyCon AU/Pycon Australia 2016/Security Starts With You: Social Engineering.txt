Virus? There’s an app for that. Malware? There’s an app for that. Social engineering? It's a little more complicated. These techniques, used by hackers to gather information on their target, are hard to combat without education - so why don’t we talk about them more often? Aimed at the average user who could be targeted by such an attack, this talk discusses the tools of social engineering, how it can be combated and why so many companies fail in preparing their employees for such an attack.

presented to us by our Tiberias Heflin

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,530
who is a who is a recent computer

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,139
security graduate who's who lives in

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,970
portland oregon who evangelizes for

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,800
privacy and security while doing

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,320
security assurance work for portland

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,769
general electric today she's going to be

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,390
telling us that security starts with you

00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:38,390
social engineering please make tiberius

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:41,910
welcome so um yeah um I'm Tiberius and I

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,239
basically I'm paranoids that my employer

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,879
doesn't have to be so um a lot of the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,829
theme of this talk will center around a

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,890
healthy dose of paranoia we're going to

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,539
be talking about social engineering and

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,969
it's really easy as easy to have a

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,629
nebulous idea of what social engineering

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:08,700
is a lot of people include malicious

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,770
intent in that some people don't I've

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,030
even met some security professionals who

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,670
would define even the act of trying to

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,509
befriend somebody as a type of social

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,119
engineering for this talk i would like

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,650
to define social engineering as an

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,450
attempt to acquire sensitive information

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,540
for malicious reasons through deception

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,960
i think that it just makes it a little

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,290
bit simpler if we all have the same

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,400
definition that we're working to so

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,390
social engineering and can works really

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,430
to exploit cognitive biases and human

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,680
behavior especially those that we learn

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,840
as children like trust politeness and

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,000
trying to be helpful especially in the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,649
in the u.s. it's a really big thing to

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,229
always tell people to have a nice day so

00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:06,780
through kind of using those inclinations

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,850
against people it's really interesting

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:16,120
what you can do

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:19,150
so social engineering relies on direct

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,440
or implied non truths in order to get a

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,050
target to act in a way that they

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,220
normally wouldn't there's lots of ways

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,890
to lie lies are generally pretty easy I

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,750
can quite happily say that I'm six foot

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,680
tall that doesn't necessarily make it

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:40,090
believable and the believability in a

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,520
lie is within the framing of the lie and

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,530
it's within these framings that we can

00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,840
see the common threads between different

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,120
types of lies in order to categorize

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,970
them and find ways to kind of work

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,550
against them so we're going to look at

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,310
some some tactics that are common and

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,650
not so common in social engineering

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,210
first one is tailgating there's also

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,620
kind of a subcategory of piggybacking

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:09,880
this one is generally pretty well-known

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,190
companies tend to be pretty good at at

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,420
least trying to enforce a policy against

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:18,190
them most people have badges that they

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,590
get that they use to get into their work

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:25,960
em so tailgating is when somebody

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,880
follows you into a secure area after

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,870
you've badged in piggybacking is when

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,730
tailgating is when they do it without

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,210
you really realizing whereas

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,390
piggybacking is when they get you two to

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,370
be complicit with their active of

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,710
sneaking in behind you your coworker who

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:51,940
always forgets their badge it's a really

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:58,300
good example of that so one of the risks

00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:00,520
of this is that um well physical access

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,130
to any system is kind of a dangerous

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
thing if you don't want somebody to have

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,860
that access so you know theft of

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:12,780
equipment theft of proprietary hardware

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:16,210
theft of software proprietary software

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,540
loss of intellectual property and

00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:22,780
workplace violence um I actually read an

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:27,160
instance where somebody tailgated

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,410
in order to hurt somebody within within

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,030
a company so there's there's a lot at

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,490
risk when it comes to tailgating that

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:41,070
companies sometimes don't explain to

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:43,120
their employees it works it works

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,650
because people want to be friendly and

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,480
helpful your co-worker who's forgotten

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,710
their badge you you want to help them

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,990
you don't want to be the jerk that says

00:04:47,710 --> 00:05:01,510
now you have to go to security mate and

00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:04,870
so when when hackers try to employ this

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,000
there's a lot of kind of covers that

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,700
they can use they could be an

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,830
overburdened delivery guy or the pizza

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:17,050
guy who's just been asked to bring pizza

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:19,450
and the delivery guy packed like a UPS

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,520
guy is really common around kind of

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,940
Christmastime when there's more packages

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,880
being delivered and people don't examine

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:31,030
credentials quite so much but the key

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,520
here is that the the hacker is trying to

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:39,490
get legitimacy through getting an

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,740
employee to buy into their story fishing

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,510
is we don't really sometimes think of

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,500
that as a form of social engineering and

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:50,530
but it's a really big aspect to it this

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,680
is trying to get sensitive information

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,490
through a deceptive email that

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,000
masquerades as a trustworthy source I'm

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,900
sure that we've all had it sorry we've

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,250
all had that happen once or twice um the

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,080
instances of phishing emails are going

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:16,539
up they're becoming a lot more common

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,120
and so the the trick with fishing is

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:22,380
that it's a wide net activity they send

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,060
emails out to as many people as they can

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,590
looking for just that a couple of people

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,270
who don't realize and take the bait we

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:36,100
see this most commonly with the Nigerian

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:41,050
prince emails there it's also called for

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,030
nine or advanced fee fraud scheme so for

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,010
those who maybe aren't as familiar this

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:50,890
is when you receive an email saying that

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:54,030
they're from a bank or some type of

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,310
institution they have a lot of money and

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,770
they need to move it out of the country

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,900
or into the country or they need your

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,760
help to move this money around and

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,120
they're willing to give you a cut of

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,340
that money in order to to get your help

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,780
and what happens is you give them a

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,980
little bit of money that they ask for

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,990
and then suddenly there's problems they

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,180
need to pay a fee they need to bribe

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,320
somebody and so they ask you for more

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:27,580
information or sorry for more money and

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,050
as you give them more money more issues

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,970
arrive and they keep asking for more and

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,050
as soon as you say no they disappear and

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,660
the money that you've given them

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,040
disappears with them now these emails

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:46,270
well not emails but the underlying

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,510
tactics of this type of scam have been

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,880
around actually since the 1920s it

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,000
started with letters and then as fax

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,560
machines became more common they started

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,590
coming through fax and now they're

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,840
coming through email it's so common that

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,130
the American Secret Service actually

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,480
have a address that people can write to

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:12,310
to tell them about instances where

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:21,300
they've fallen prey to such such scams

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:21,300
and so in March just as a kind of

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:28,810
example of this in March a company in

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:33,940
the u.s. called pivotal was a subject to

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:40,210
a attack and what happened in this

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:42,190
attack is the hacker the scammer did

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,630
their t-shirt research they found out

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,400
who in the company works in finance and

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,390
they sent an email to this person

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,030
claimed

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,980
to be from CEO asking them for tax

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,460
information for many of the employees

00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,750
the company and not realizing anything

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,070
was wrong and the gentleman followed

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,630
through pulled the information together

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,500
and sent that off and reply to the email

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,280
unfortunately the email did not actually

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,050
come from the CEO it came from a still

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,360
unknown source who now has all these

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:28,150
people's tax information which leads

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:30,810
them open to to identity theft and so

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:34,080
with this this is an example of

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:37,090
spearfishing which is a targeted attack

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,550
that usually involves a lot of research

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,710
first they know who their target is

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,670
which makes them a little bit more

00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:49,510
difficult to to catch there's also

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,210
another kind of similar type of attack

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,840
called a whale phishing attack which is

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:59,530
aimed at hive hi monetary target so CEOs

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,460
are quite likely to be too sore to be

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:06,460
the target of that type of attack and

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,830
there's a new kind of attack that's

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:12,340
coming into coming becoming more common

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:17,040
called an angler phishing attack which

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:20,200
is when a scammer will create an account

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,940
looking like a customer service account

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,170
for a service provider and then wait

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,460
looking on social media for people to

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,890
complain and say that they're having a

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,540
problem with a particular service and

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,900
then they'll email their target saying I

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,460
saw your email I saw your or ice I saw

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,770
your tweet or I saw your post on

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,210
Facebook and I'd like to help you with

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,230
your problem please give me your login

00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:46,330
details these are really highly

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:52,150
personalized really clever and they can

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:55,360
be really difficult spot um kind of as a

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,660
follow-on a lot of these um kind of

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,200
particularly the emails give you a link

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,320
to connect to or they sometimes have a

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,560
file within them

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,540
asking you to to download the file

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:13,640
perhaps it's claiming it's a PDF or

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,470
something and these often more commonly

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,810
now have ransomware within them

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,690
ransomware is becoming a lot bigger

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,020
issue now and what happens when you

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,040
download this is that it actually

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,950
encrypts a portion of your hard drive

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,470
focuses on folders that are known to

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,210
have sensitive information in them and

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,820
then pops up with the screen saying

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:41,540
you're now encrypted please send us so

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,870
much money and bitcoins and these are

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,510
becoming a really really common without

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:53,900
a good backup some companies have been

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:58,790
forced to to actually pay out in it as

00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:01,340
of April CNBC which is a new source in

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:07,370
the States estimates that just in the US

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:11,840
alone 209 million has been actually lost

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,750
due to do to ransomware so it's

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,550
definitely a large problem and we're

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:21,110
still looking at ways to really combat

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:24,530
that which is why awareness of fishing

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,390
and the hallmarks of of those types of

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:31,220
emails is an important thing to look for

00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:33,470
and to be educated on and so this is an

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,720
example phishing email that I actually

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,640
receive this morning I don't know if you

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,180
can have a quick look over that and

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,330
count how many how many indicators you

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:52,790
can find that this is not a real email

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:55,850
from apple but these are these are the

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,240
ones that I found so you can see they've

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,370
spelled Apple wrong in the supposed

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,470
email address which is there to cover up

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,840
this other email address that has

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:10,430
nothing to do with apple the Apple logo

00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,280
is entirely not quite right I don't know

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,089
if I've ever seen Apple add TM next to

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:21,870
their names you know it's trademarked

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:25,389
and then there you to take quick action

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,209
so that you don't lose your services

00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,589
which is another hallmark of these types

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,079
of emails they want to get you

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,970
emotionally invested they want you to be

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:39,670
concerned so that you aren't thinking

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:43,180
rationally they also ask you to click on

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,490
a link within the email and in this case

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,300
the email or the link actually goes to

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,829
mec cornbread calm I don't know if I've

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,759
ever heard of Apple using that

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:57,129
particular domain and enter your account

00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,279
information there to ensure the security

00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:04,050
of your account so these are the things

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:07,749
to look for the spelling errors the

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,990
strange kind of formatting the fact that

00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:12,459
Apple don't appear to know my name is a

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,649
little concerning since they're telling

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,860
me my account has been locked and

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:21,129
certainly don't click on links within

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:27,269
the email you can hover over the link to

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:30,160
see where it's directed to so the next

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,499
kind of topic is pretexting which is

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,529
often called blagging in scotland and

00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:37,660
this is the act of spinning a story an

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,089
invented scenario to get people to act

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:46,600
in a way that they might not do

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:51,670
otherwise so one of the most interesting

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,999
for me stories that comes of pre texting

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:57,999
is from frank abagnale jr who is kind of

00:14:54,999 --> 00:15:02,009
the king of this when he was in his 19 s

00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:02,009
and a night when he was about 19 20 and

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:09,279
he actually convinced pan and Pan Am

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:12,759
airlines that he was a pilot for them

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,399
who was out and about flying planes and

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,970
had lost his uniform while at a hotel

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,550
having it laundered and through talking

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,269
to a woman on the phone and creating a

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,929
fake document showing his credentials he

00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:29,680
was able to find out from the velocity

00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,529
at panam on the

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,220
phone where they got their uniforms from

00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:38,500
and then go there and actually get a

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,490
spare uniform or a uniform from them

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:46,810
which he then used to go on numerous

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,390
flights as a pilot and fly a plane I'd

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:54,730
like to think that this is not as easy

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:58,690
now but it's hard to say um so in the US

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:01,029
we have grandma scans scams even that

00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,550
are really really common you'll get a

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:07,209
phone call from somebody going hello

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,260
grandma is that you and they'll try and

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,899
convince you that they're having

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,660
problems and that they need money my

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,190
grandmother actually had a call like

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,700
this and she was really really proud

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:21,760
when she told me she says I heard the

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,250
guy say my name or ask tell me that he

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,060
was having trouble in Mexico and she

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,040
goes I said David's is that you he's

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,990
like yeah grandma it's me and she said I

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,940
don't have a grandson named David and

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,770
hung up on him so it's great that she

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,320
thought that through but it also tells

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,970
me that all of my paranoia and telling

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,110
her to be careful and warning her about

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,839
these things does eventually get through

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,360
I actually heard about instances here in

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,470
Australia and you have what are called

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,830
cold call investment scams where people

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:02,230
will call up generally older targets and

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,350
convince them to invest and what they're

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:09,400
calling high high yield stock they take

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,170
their money and they run apparently this

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,480
averages between twenty to thirty

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:18,000
thousand from each victim they actually

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,470
get to give them money so it's not a

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,050
u.s. problem and it's not an Australian

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,059
problem or it's not a regionalized thing

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,160
it's it's everywhere I think that the

00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:29,679
types of scams that you get tend to be

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,559
regionalized though they look for what

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,820
will work within the society and the

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:41,010
kind of the way that people think within

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,560
a local area so

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,500
when talking about pretext pretexting

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,720
I've used a lot of examples because they

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,060
are invented scenarios and it's really

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,760
difficult to tell you exactly what's

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:58,560
going to be said the way to combat this

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,990
is to be spits suspicious study if

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,420
something seems off if it seems too true

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,240
if somebody seems too nosy or they know

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,740
too much start asking questions start

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,100
trying to pull apart their story and

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:16,020
ensure that what this person is trying

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:18,720
to sell you is is a real thing and so

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,280
baiting is like the real world chosen

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,900
horse it's a really interesting

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:27,240
phenomenon and it's actually when a

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,660
attacker will leave something out for a

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,230
target to find most common one that I've

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:37,310
seen recently is USB drives just leaving

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,980
them out this comes from a study where

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:44,220
about 300 us bees were put out across

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,020
across a university campus and they

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,910
waited to see how many people pick them

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,550
up and how many people actually use them

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,020
as you can see if the devices had

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:57,540
actually had malware on them it would

00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:01,440
have been a very very useful attack so

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,330
the best way to stop and to protect

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,060
yourself from social engineering attacks

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,860
is being aware and having personal

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,600
vigilance from a company's point of view

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,450
this makes uneducated employees their

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,640
number one weakness if people don't

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,050
understand why they should do something

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,260
they're going to cut corners for

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:26,340
convenience just quickly because I'm

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,650
running out of time in HR they've known

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,560
that people who are engaged are more

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,520
productive it's very well known and

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,460
they're more willing to go to bat for

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,840
the company so why do companies fail to

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,970
get buy-in from their most valuable

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,330
employee or from their most valuable

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,340
assets the people on the front lines

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,260
it's because they don't prioritize

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,960
security education or they don't deliver

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,480
it all others focus on compliance and

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
use click through elearning that doesn't

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,830
actually educate people

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,920
and it's hard to trust users that you

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:04,580
know have subpar training there's also

00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:07,020
an element of budgetary constraints so

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:11,210
properly training people is expensive so

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:16,350
companies rely on tools to protect while

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:18,780
minimizing user interactions this is

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,740
great from a technology standpoint but

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,780
it can't actually help all the time so

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,120
how do we change and how do we move

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,150
forward what we need to recognize it

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,360
it's cultural issue and it's not just an

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,820
IT issue so we need to get rid of the

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,730
e-learning we need to use recurring

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,350
bite-sized trading I would recommend

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,240
classroom and video training that

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:45,000
happens regularly to keep it fresh in

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,560
people's minds and engage people by

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,210
showing them how it applies to them

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,860
personally and not just the company so

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,220
I've covered a lot and I'm running out

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,950
of time so I'm not going to sum up to

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,200
learn more I would recommend reading

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,930
kevin Mitnick or frank abagnale juniors

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,310
stories it's really interesting to see

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,240
what they were capable of doing when

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:11,160
they were active and this is where you

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:21,480
can get further information if you're so

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:23,730
inclined so thank you and great so I

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,560
have a microphone here if we'd like to

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,910
use this microphone to us Tiberius a

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:33,750
question please raise your hand and I'll

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:36,390
run it over to you Jess um thanks for I

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,420
was just um regarding me on the phishing

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,980
emails I've read that a lot of the time

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,570
the scammers might intentionally put

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,520
things like spelling mistakes or obvious

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,930
of using obviously dodgy trademarks

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,100
there's a way of filtering out people

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,230
that might know better do you give them

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,660
credit for that or is yet what's for

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,120
sure it's definitely something that I've

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,290
seen happen a lot um in fact if you

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,740
follow the link that's on that email

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,750
because I did that actually looks a lot

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,670
more professional actually it looks like

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,720
something that you could act could think

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,350
was a real website or a real Apple

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,539
website

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,679
if it weren't for the the web address at

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,049
the top so if you were looking at that

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,440
from a phone sometimes phone browsers

00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:21,480
mask the address it would look very

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:24,570
legitimate I just like to get your

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,580
thoughts on best practices for email so

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,380
at least in Australia when you get an

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,600
email from a bank it will never have a

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,690
URL of any kind in it it'll say go to

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,059
your internet banking and do XYZ however

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,100
I've noticed paypal and ebay don't

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,620
follow that you can get a legitimate

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,140
email from either of those organizations

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,640
that has a link in it you'll and you

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,789
know if it's a legit email you'll go to

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:52,169
the legit site and all's good what are

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:57,330
your thoughts on those on well what are

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:59,940
your thoughts on that he's putting web

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:03,059
links in email for sensitive things ever

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,360
behind authentication obviously ever a

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:09,510
good idea and if so are there guidelines

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,820
like make sure the link text is actually

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,100
the URL or something like that in my

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,900
opinion I I think that we really need to

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,900
give away from that and we need to start

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,030
putting links in emails and what I would

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,990
like to see done is moving towards a

00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:27,539
more secure email system nicely email

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,370
but a lot of companies now will send you

00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,220
a mail saying you have something in your

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,350
email in your inbox with us and so you

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,179
go to their website you log in and

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,400
you've got a meal there and that has the

00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,370
sensitive information in it and I think

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,260
that that's a better solution as

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,049
frustrating as an annoying as is to have

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,330
to kind of take those steps I think that

00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:51,510
it's it's a better way of doing business

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:54,240
until we find a more secure kind of

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:59,059
communication source than email are

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,059
there any other questions here here

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:11,240
hi so i think i have read and are an

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:15,990
article about it dude decisions that

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,760
someone you couldn't uh you couldn't

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,250
consider information stored on your

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,320
computer not accessible to third parties

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,200
because people's computer as are usually

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,390
compromised so with emails not contain

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:35,040
your best information not containing

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:38,160
links and so on yes ah is it is it a

00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,700
good practice to encourage people to not

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,150
do all the things so that instead of

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,700
educating users to secure their systems

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,700
look at the links we actually work

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,680
around the problems and create no

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,420
further problems down strength I think

00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,060
that you need to recognize that there

00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,130
are some people you can educate and some

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,430
people who are not going to listen or

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,680
don't have the technological

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,360
understandings to be able to understand

00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,100
the education that's being provided them

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,440
there's a whole lot of people out there

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,830
that never had computers until they were

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,220
in their later years in life and so we

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,020
need to to find solutions for everybody

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,540
so while we should come back the

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,980
problems on an educational front I think

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,160
that it's important to also combat the

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:32,580
problems in a way that the average user

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:34,830
cannot can understand plasmas two-factor

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,810
authentication what's the best way to

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,390
convince people to actually you know use

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:44,130
them enforce it give them no choice i

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:48,420
will say that it's really interesting

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:50,310
with two factor authentication some some

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,510
solutions are better than others i've

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,720
had problems with the Google

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,760
Authenticator working with with gmail at

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,950
all so I've had to be on it on the

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,740
texting rather than using their

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,690
Authenticator for two factor and it's

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,590
been really frustrating and it's I think

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,510
we need to get better with the

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:11,010
technology and we need to force it hi uh

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,910
do you think there's any value in

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,680
actually trying to

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,870
things banks and things like that to use

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,940
email certificates to provide actual

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:20,580
validation of origin or do you think

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,430
users would just never adjust I'm

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:27,450
something else I I really want to see a

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:31,230
better solution than email and while you

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:35,670
know using certified email and and even

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:38,190
you know using like PGP and having that

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,170
that be done that way I think that were

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,450
past that point some of these solutions

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,430
are so complex that certain users and

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,980
certain user groups just will never be

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,240
able to use them so as I said before I

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,190
think we need to find solutions that

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,900
work for everybody oh my experience has

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,270
been a lot of companies are still really

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,890
bad at this you know whether it's phone

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,960
calls where they ask you to it then to

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,120
get you to the bank or emails of links

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,870
and stuff like that do you have any you

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,820
know from you experience actually

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,050
working with companies to do this how to

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,870
get that feedback to the right person

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:13,160
how to make sure company's improved um I

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:15,630
think it's really difficult because even

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,940
even being a security person within a

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,470
firm that has these same issues it's

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,530
really difficult to effect change

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,940
without getting sea level by n so I

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,560
think that it's just important to

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,640
continually repeat the message and and

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,590
even if you're telling this to your bank

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,120
teller or to the person on the phone

00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,730
that you're not giving them your

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,010
information but you'll call back the

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,610
more people that do that the more that

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:45,240
will get fed back thanks for the talk

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:48,750
and being in a probably bigger company

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,210
do you see any value in running internal

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,460
scamming attacks to then be able to

00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,440
teach your employees about what could

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,720
have possibly go wrong yeah we actually

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,380
we do that regularly within my company

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:06,930
and we have seen the effects that it

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:08,490
reduces we certainly you're never going

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,600
to catch everybody every time but

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,840
there's definitely been an improvement

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,990
however we have seen our success go a

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,610
little too far because we'll see users

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,980
who catch on really quick and they'll

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,710
email other people within the company

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,930
saying oh I saw this I saw this phishing

00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,740
attack don't click on the link which is

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,100
great that the

00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,750
trying to educate each other however it

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,390
makes a lot difficult for a lot more

00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,880
difficult for us to gauge who we need to

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,710
educate further and who we don't this

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,510
has been a really good Q&A I think we

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,880
have time for one more question so if

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:46,140
they're cool we have one more question

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,470
excellent um one of the attacks that you

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,540
mentioned was was it pretext spinning a

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,480
story to get a passion what would you

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,510
say is the best way to circumvent like

00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,050
incrementally obtaining information

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,790
through like so you know say one system

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,920
of authentication requires you know your

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,360
date of birth and your last name or

00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,730
something but you can get the date of

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,350
birth through aha spinning spinning a

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,640
story with another service you know if

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,250
you're targeting an attack what would

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,780
you say is the best i think that when

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,690
you're you're spreading your attacks

00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,210
over different companies um that

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,220
fragment fragmentation is going to

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,520
provide you a little more success than

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,170
than just focusing in on one target but

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,929
i think the important thing to do is to

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,210
keep your information as secure as you

00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:35,700
can and when somebody asks you for

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,210
information over the phone to challenge

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,890
them and to to double-check always try

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,200
and verify from a third source that it's

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,750
a legitimate query especially if it's

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,970
something that's out of the ordinary so

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,150
for example the the guy that got the

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,960
supposedly got the email from the CEO

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,830
what you should have done is he should

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,530
have been called the CEO and

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,700
double-checked so i think that it's

00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:02,670
really important to kind of get in that

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:04,910
mindset of friendly but skeptical with

00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,740
any kind of requests for information

00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,570
okay well that is the end of our Q&A

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,460
session as a token of our appreciation

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:14,160
