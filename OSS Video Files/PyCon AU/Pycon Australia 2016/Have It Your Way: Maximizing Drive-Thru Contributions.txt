They drop by, they fix their particular problem, they leave. They're the drive-through contributor. While, yes, we all would prefer that these people stick around and join the community, there's no denying that a good drive-thru contribution adds value to your project. 

A strong argument can be made that the more drive-thru contributors your project has, the healthier the project process and ecosystem. It shows that you've set up a process which is easy to understand, easy to follow, and which makes it easy to contribute. In a situation like that, it increases the opportunities for new contributors to become new community members and everyone is a winner.

This talk will present:

* Methods for maximizing drive-thru contributions
* Overall advantages of those methods for your project
* An argument for using number of drive-thru contributions as a metric for project health

to introduce the Umbra sir she's a

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,519
manager of technical people project

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,730
processes products and businesses at

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,130
unit Packard working on a team that's

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,740
100% dedicated to open source and today

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:25,830
she is talking about maximizing drive

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:27,180
through contributions and the timer is

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,670
running hello everyone

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,260
if you're not here for maximizing drive

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,579
through contributions then please stick

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,660
around because it's good content I don't

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
have a lot of time so I'm just going to

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,870
dive right into it first of all super

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,520
fast introduction because you're not

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,930
here to learn about me but I am V

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,660
Ambrose or but because of all friends

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,370
here you can just call me Vicky also the

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,289
VM the virtual machine jokes have gotten

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,390
really old so as Marcus said I am a

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,879
senior software engineering manager at

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,100
Hewlett Packard enterprise I work in

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,620
service to a team which is a hundred

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,170
percent dedicated to upstream open

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,780
source development primarily in

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,430
OpenStack but I also support the work of

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,600
Donald stuffed and Cory Ben fields so

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,070
and I want to take a moment to thank

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,259
Hewlett Packard Enterprise for

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,549
everything they do for open-source

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,509
including supporting these very vital

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:28,049
Python endeavors yes that's worthy of

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:29,340
applause all right so because I am a

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,869
manager I'm going to do something that

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,040
is known in the management world as

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:37,860
setting up expectations first of all

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,560
what we will cover this is normally a 50

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,479
minute talk I'm going to do it in 30 so

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,579
it will be a 50,000 foot view of the

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
subject a lot of things will have had to

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,790
be cut for time I will be available

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,880
afterward if you need to talk to me

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,530
however I will define what a drive

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,180
through contributor and contribution is

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,070
I will tell you some of the

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,619
disadvantages that people report about

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,170
these things and then because I'm biased

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,909
I'll tell you the advantages and why you

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,920
should care and then how you can

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,630
maximize drive throughs what I am not

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,429
going to do at any point during this

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,649
conversation at least not focus on it

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,020
specifically is tell you how to convert

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,050
a drive through contributor to

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,220
a community member this is a really

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,400
important thing but we're just not going

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,780
to cover it right now a lot of the

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,050
things I will tell you about how to

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,250
maximize a drive-thru contribution

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,720
benefit everybody and can actually help

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,540
with this so you can get double duty

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,970
with those also please save your

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,680
questions for after the talk as I said

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,990
it usually is a 50-minute thing now it's

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,470
crammed down into 30 so and I'm

00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,520
jet-lagged and easily distracted

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,570
one of those questions is always where

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,730
can I get the slides they're available

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,170
right now at internet archive where

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,650
everybody should post their slides

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,810
because proprietary sucks I will give

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,970
you this URL afterward as well so you

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,600
can get it later

00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,200
so let's start with those definitions

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,460
for the purposes of this talk only a

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,500
contribution is anything which can be

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,000
checked into source control now there

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
are lots of other ways that we can

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,390
contribute to open source projects and

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,250
they're all very important you can do

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,770
project management you do community

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,000
management bug triaging there's so many

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,000
different ways you can contribute to

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,420
open source but they all require a

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,670
larger commitment to the project so for

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,870
this talk when I say contribution I mean

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,810
something that's committed to source

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,690
control a contributor is anyone who does

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,790
that committing may not kind of linger

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,530
on that's pretty simple

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,450
Drive Thru contributor somebody who

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,930
shows up gives you one contribution then

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,400
bugs out you never see them again

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,800
this is sometimes seen in the literature

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,240
as a drive-by contributor but I lived in

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,910
California for 18 years and we have

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,410
other connotations for that so I won't

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:54,180
be calling these drive-bys hmm so let's

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,060
get going with some more interesting

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,280
stuff when I first hit upon this idea of

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,680
maximizing Drive Thru contributors and

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,150
why it matters to your project I went to

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,130
Twitter as I do for pretty much

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,250
everything as you all who follow me know

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,890
that and I asked for people to speak to

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,660
me what's it like receiving or giving a

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,700
drive-through contribution and a lot of

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,020
people came back to me I did a lot of

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,730
one-on-one interviews over email dm's

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,510
Skype to talk to people to gather

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,479
information

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,210
what follows therefore is data-driven

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,550
but I'm not going to give you the data

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,620
I have 30 minutes so first of all let me

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,389
tell you something category of some of

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,680
the characteristics of contributions and

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,680
contributors for drive-throughs

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,599
contributions are easiest so I'll start

00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,580
there there are primarily four

00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,310
categories that I found in my research

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,199
for drive through contributions you have

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,910
self service you have a bug that's

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,319
bugging you work-related you have to get

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,210
something done for the job but something

00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,630
is blocking you otherwise you wouldn't

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,389
contribute at all you have a special

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,300
project or use case let's say harkening

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,610
back to Russell's earlier keynote you

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,639
want to get that biast support back into

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,340
Python 3 that would be your drive

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,139
through contribution and then there are

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,870
documentation addition and fixes these

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:22,070
are the largest category of drive

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:25,610
through contributions so contributions

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,259
are really easy because the code what's

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,159
difficult to categorize are contributors

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,130
because they're people

00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,840
we're difficult squishy objects right so

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm not gonna categorize contributors

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,789
but I will give you some information of

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,860
some of the tendencies of drive through

00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,219
contributors first of all why do they

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,169
show up that's important why do they

00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,070
show up to your project well you not

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,840
going to surprise you

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,270
they are scratching that itch they do

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,639
have that bug that need to squash so

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,759
they do that there's that one typo or

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,300
there that one time somebody says who

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,849
instead of whom in your documentation so

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,240
they show up and they fix that sometimes

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:07,430
they are unable or unwilling to use

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,680
another project often this happens when

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,060
they are using it for work say there are

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,370
a huge fan of Postgres but they're

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,560
working in a MySQL shop they really have

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,440
to fix that one thing so they show up

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,750
for that and then they bug out but most

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,979
often they like you they really really

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,020
like you they love your project they

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,120
love what it does for them and they want

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,800
to participate they want to contribute

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,880
plate don't have a lot of time because I

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,550
didn't know about you but I have a life

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,560
not much of one but I have one and a lot

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,060
of it my time can't be dedicated to

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,539
giving contributions to open source

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,360
projects unfortunately so these really

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,039
are the

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,590
my reasons that I found in my research

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,129
that people show up to your project as

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,599
drive throughs but why do they leave

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,379
that's considerably harder because it

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,969
turns out not many people bother asking

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,039
but I was able to find something first

00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:57,719
of all they scratch that itch get the

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,240
obvious one out of the way they fix that

00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:04,259
who whom problem Twitter I'm looking at

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,710
you often they just don't have time

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,159
though

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:11,669
and we all have this problem budgets are

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:13,889
difficult things every resource is

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,840
valuable but time is one that you can

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,580
never get back so they make one

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,580
contribution then they just don't have

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,919
the time to make another sometimes they

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,650
stop using your project let's say that

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,870
they leave that mysql shop or that yes

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,699
they leave that mysql shop so they never

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,740
have to contribute to my askew l again

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:39,180
sorry oracle but often it's difficult to

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,060
contribute they give you lines of code

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,550
and tests and documentation and blood

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,819
and sweat and tears and it takes them

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,190
forever they are never doing that again

00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,889
because it was just so bloody hard did

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,620
it once fool me once more shame me for

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,500
me twice no that's not going to happen

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,870
and then sometimes they're not

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,479
appreciated they'll give you a pull

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:08,210
request it will be silently merged no

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:12,960
thanks nothing and unfortunately

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,699
 as you know when I was doing my

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,279
interviews I heard some really grim

00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,800
stories one drive through contributors

00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,779
said that they gave a patch to a project

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,719
and then the core contributors took

00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,969
credit for their work another said that

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:29,669
they took all the time and effort which

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:31,110
was considerable to make a patch but

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,360
even though it was a project they really

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,550
liked after seeing how the community

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,940
worked they didn't want to be a member

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:43,469
of that snark Club and so they left so

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,079
 big reason why people leave so

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,490
as I was talking to these people I was

00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,140
talking not only to drive through

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,930
contributors but also organisers of

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,770
various projects and some of them

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,300
admitted

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,830
- using dismissive behavior what I

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,690
personally would call as ho Larry

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,720
towards various drive-through

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,580
contributors and they rationalize this

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,649
by saying that but there are

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:14,010
disadvantages to having drive-through

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:15,839
contributors in your project from one of

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,620
the reasons is that it just takes time

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,649
you know I as a very beleaguered

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,720
difficult hard hit my god I'm giving you

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,930
so much time to help you get your patch

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,430
in and land it and then you just leave

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,370
I've just lost all those hours of my

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,230
life I did not follow up with yeah but

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:39,810
you got a patch out of it that's rude

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,000
but what they all said is that these

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,860
people aren't community why would I

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,060
spend time on them if it's obvious

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,860
they're not going to become a member of

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,190
my community that's because these people

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,080
are seeing things like this here's the

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,000
hierarchy of people that they are seeing

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,060
in their project they're seeing

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,579
community as the foundation of their

00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,589
project that is the most important part

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,540
after that you have contributors and

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,570
course they're not narcissistic enough

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,010
to put the chords at the bottom so these

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,750
people aren't community so therefore I

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,350
don't want to help them they're not

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,810
going to stick around problem is your

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,820
actual foundation of your community of

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,470
your project or your contributors

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,320
because if you don't have contributors

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,779
you will never have community these are

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,180
people who have their priorities just a

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,980
little out of whack community is super

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,899
important you're going to hear me

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,910
talking about community immensely I

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,620
write about it I talk about it I will

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,130
help you with it as much as you as

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:42,390
humanly possible I'm code of conduct

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:44,779
I love community but it is not the

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:50,010
foundation of the people in your project

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:52,560
so therefore I believe that an

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,170
ever-increasing number of drive through

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,510
contributions and contributors is a

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,820
possible sign of a healthy project and

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,370
if your project does not have that it's

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,830
possible that you don't have a healthy

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,420
project so

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,580
if you do have a lot of drive-through

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,980
contributors if you are measuring this

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,370
and you're seeing that metric go up that

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,390
can be a sign of a lot of good stuff if

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,950
you have a lot of drive-through

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,660
contributors means more people are

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,899
looking at your project and who doesn't

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,269
want that they're also using it which is

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,670
really even better than just looking at

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,310
it and more people are able to

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,260
contribute if more people are able to

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,540
contribute then that validates your

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,860
contribution process and that's cool and

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,510
therefore you also end up with a lot

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,399
more contributors which you can

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,220
eventually convert to community members

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:51,740
you can build that foundation upon which

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:53,970
your project is based so pardon me

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,459
apparently I left my working lungs in

00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:02,459
Portland so that metric of drive through

00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:06,029
contributors maximising it can do a lot

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,709
of good things for your project if you

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,690
focus on maximizing drive for

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,490
contributors you will end up with a

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,320
better process not overnight

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,120
nothing is overnight there is no silver

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,730
bullet but you will end up with an

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,829
improved process it will be open clear

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,570
direct and unambiguous and if your

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,339
process is open clear direct and

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,649
unambiguous it also means that the

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,350
methods you use to communicate it are

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:32,100
also open clear direct and unambiguous

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,350
and who doesn't love that we also see

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,970
improved numbers assuming that you are

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,350
looking at numbers at all some

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,010
communities don't but if you do please

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,959
look at floss community metrics org you

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,850
will have more contributions and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,640
naturally more contributors if you have

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,829
more Drive Thru contributors you have a

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,170
better process and more people giving

00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,910
you code then you will have faster merge

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,720
time and release time because you got a

00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:00,839
fast process you also will end up with a

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,899
much higher quality project leanness is

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,790
law which doesn't always work and

00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,060
sometimes gets mocked but in this case

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,820
it does with more eyes or with enough

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,589
eyes all bugs are shallow drive-through

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,010
contributors get you an immense number

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,640
of eyes so they're finding more bugs and

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,220
if they're finding more bugs

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,810
there's sometimes fixing them they're

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,180
fixing more bugs it often comes with

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,640
test coverage and documentation coverage

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,560
and this helps your project overall just

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,029
because you've focused on maximizing the

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,589
people who show up give you one patch

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:38,290
and leave you also can have end up with

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,510
a happy approach at culture people are

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:45,310
seeing seeing your project as more

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,220
welcoming more friendly if you have

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,019
better quality code and a better quality

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,490
project or a better quality culture you

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,370
end up with a better quality project

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,040
overall combine these two things code

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,570
and people that is open source and when

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,279
you improve both of them for your

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,260
project everyone wins

00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,360
and you can do that by focusing on drive

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,850
through contributions you are more

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,269
accessible this will lead to more

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,930
exposure and that leads to more project

00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:15,430
adoption and this is a beneficial cycle

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,690
the more you do it the better it gets

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,490
the more you do it the better it gets

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,380
and that is a healthier project overall

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,829
so I've Yaman on a bit about why you

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,769
should care now I'll tell you some

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,899
methods for maximizing drive through

00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,940
contributions

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,519
now I'm gonna rattle off a bunch of

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,980
stuff I'm definitely not going to cover

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,140
everything and I would like to point out

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,110
yet I don't expect anyone to try all of

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,670
these things your mileage may vary no

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,079
silver bullet you know yada yada yada so

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:53,470
look at this as sort of an iterative

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:56,320
development sort of space look at your

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,070
project analyze it see what it needs see

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,070
what it wants find one suggestion just

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,589
one and focus on that make that change

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,320
do the measurement and then see whether

00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,300
it worked and if it did great try

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,850
another change and just sort of build

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,410
slowly don't do it all at once we all

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,430
know that if you make tons of changes

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,899
and then commit the code you're gonna

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,209
break the build and not know what the

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,990
heck did it right so just do one at a

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:26,770
time so let's get started most of these

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,839
involve documentation now I believe very

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,430
strongly to the core of my being that

00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,810
documentation gives your project

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,610
superpowers in a way

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:39,400
that nothing else does documentation

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,279
scales it scales people it scales

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,770
thoughts it scales concepts in a way

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,380
that a single brain can't a single core

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,510
community member can't so document the

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,170
crap out of everything and everybody

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:57,430
will be grateful how readable is that

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,589
not bad so if you improve your

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,690
documentation focusing on the needs of a

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:03,240
drive-through contributor then it will

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:06,339
ensure efficient and successful

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,920
contributions right it allows everyone

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,980
to set up expectations here's what I

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,260
need to do I see this here's what I

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,480
expect you to do I have said this and

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,310
this makes it very efficient and makes

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,779
it more likely that people are going to

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,820
participate in your project because they

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,880
see that you have recognized this and

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,529
you've taken the time to write it down

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,660
also saves a lot of time by minimizing

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:32,320
questions people showing up into your

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,970
IRC channel huge IRC fans so I'm just

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,740
gonna use that in all my examples so

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,390
they show up to your IRC channel and

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,880
they keep asking the same questions over

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,190
and over again that wastes a lot of

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,110
people's time people are asking the same

00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:49,930
question more than once you've got a doc

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:52,210
bug please fix it it also standardizes

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,580
processes that makes everybody happy

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,650
because you don't have every single

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,910
person in your project doing something a

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,760
different way you're all pulling in the

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,500
same direction doing the same things for

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,250
the same reason and that is a force

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,290
multiplier so there's lots and lots of

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,790
different ways that you can focus on

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:16,060
drive through contributors with your

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:17,560
documentation ok photo taken so I will

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,319
just highlight a few that I think might

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,720
be helpful first of all is just a

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,420
QuickStart guide this doesn't have to be

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,360
anything you know mind-blowing it's just

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,620
a high-level summary of your project

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,540
here's all the documents here's where

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,640
you can find these things you know

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,220
here's a list of all the relevant Docs

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,900
you might want to have a look at just

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,429
link to them when those links should be

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,040
to your how to contribute doc this

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,930
should be

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,400
definitely a thing of beauty because

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,820
this is going to help more than anything

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,040
else

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,710
details assume zero knowledge step zero

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,960
what operating system are you using

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,400
branch from there because don't assume

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
everybody's on a Mac don't just zoom

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,100
everybody's running the latest a bun -

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,430
don't assume so that it's checklists are

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,130
wonderful do I one of my hobbies is

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,200
studying failure and when the ways that

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:17,610
you minimize failure is by making

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,490
checklists it literally saves lives so

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,840
how do you contribute great doc

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,390
communication routes

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,790
do you prefer slack or IRC do you have a

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,220
mailing list do you want everyone to put

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,480
everything and github issues how do you

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,830
want people to communicate because if

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,390
you don't set up expectations up front

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,560
and tell them how they can contact you I

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,480
can guarantee they're not going to do

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,920
that they will do whatever is most

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,780
convenient for them because it's what

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,060
they know best we default to what we

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,920
know best so set up expectations first

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,950
and tell people how to contact you for

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,860
the results tell them whom to contact

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,510
for what and how how often have you been

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,080
sitting in an IRC channel of some

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:01,130
variety or chat channel some new person

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,010
walks in and says whom do I ask about

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,630
right happens all the time and again if

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,850
somebody has to ask something more than

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:13,920
once you have a doc bug so document that

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,600
if you have a lot of drive through

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,120
contributors and some projects do some

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,200
just by design won't and that's all okay

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,460
you know not every project needs them

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,430
consider having dedicated communication

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,320
ropes for that hey what this does is it

00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,330
not only reduces the noise in your

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,980
normal communication routes and I

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,210
believe me your experience people are

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,890
going to probably appreciate that

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,540
because they can just get on with their

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,300
lives and they don't want all these

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,400
questions coming at them but what it

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,320
also does is it gives you drive through

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,760
contributors and other new contributors

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,990
a safe space they can ask the questions

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,170
which they might not feel comfortable

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,210
asking elsewhere so this is really great

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,000
if you do that please make sure that at

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,580
least one experienced person you

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,260
in the channel at all time is looking at

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,429
the mailing list otherwise you're not

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,539
going to be able to help your new

00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,610
contributors and they will help each

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,669
other and while that is admirable

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,870
they're probably doing it wrong

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:12,059
code of conduct I'm not going to go into

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,340
details because here in Python land we

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,620
know what this is and we do it well but

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,030
if you have one it does show your drive

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,880
for contributors that you care about

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,870
their health and well-being and if you

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,530
don't care about their health and

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,760
well-being

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,940
they're probably not going to show up to

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,070
begin with so please have one who's who

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,419
who are your project leaders who are

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,299
your core contributors and subject

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,669
matter experts document that because

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,340
people will want to know I have a really

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:40,409
gnarly problem with security whom do I

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,080
ask well if people don't know it's tibs

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:46,289
they're not going to they'll just ask

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,870
everyone right so don't waste tips is

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,640
time well actually be waste tips is time

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,520
she loves it she's sweet if you haven't

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,929
met tibs she's marvelous also if you are

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,610
large enough to have sub teams as

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,039
OpenStack is I'm very familiar with

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,350
OpenStack very biased because team works

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,870
on it you know doc that rules and

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,950
processes most please paces most

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,549
projects won't have this but if you do

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,970
document how to become a core

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:14,760
contributor this is really motivating to

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,500
people they see as they show up to give

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,350
you a contribution that oh wait they've

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,330
actually thought this through this is a

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,010
project that cares this is a project

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,830
that sees that it's important to

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,140
standardize what makes a core and what

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,090
does not and also when time comes to

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,500
select course its minimizes bias by the

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,039
way because you've documented what it

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,049
takes to be core so you can't exclude

00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,940
people of color you can't exclude women

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,909
you can't exclude you know people who

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,530
don't speak good English so that's

00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,850
really great also if you are large

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,630
enough for elections and government got

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:50,580
that but most aren't project roadmap it

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,159
can help drive your contributors know

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,890
when and how their patch might get

00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,870
landed so document that and it can

00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,429
minimize a lot of questions and allow

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:04,429
them to time their contributions

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:07,799
accordingly your project I guarantee

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,539
uses a special language people are going

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,290
to show up and want to give you their

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,330
patch

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,030
not know the language you speak but if

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,980
you document that then at least you have

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,420
some place to direct them if you want

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,880
them to stick around and many people do

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,990
nothing makes somebody feel excluded

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,460
like sitting in a room full of people

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,940
who are laughing and they don't get the

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,140
joke

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,050
so document your in jokes don't use it

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,570
as an us-versus-them gating factor

00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,860
because that's as Hillary right so

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,440
that's some examples of documentation

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,540
you can do mentoring code review is

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,420
marvelous you can really help people be

00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,700
successful through code review we have

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,440
Garrett out there we have github I

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,000
believe gitlab probably has a similar

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,040
thing bitbucket you know they all have

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,470
methods for you to do code review so

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,170
please do that

00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:01,260
office hours once a month for four hours

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,480
we have everybody sitting around in our

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,810
IRC Channel ask us anything new

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,000
contributors welcome this can maximize

00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:12,480
people showing up and actually giving

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,190
you a patch hack fests doesn't have to

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,550
be sponsored by anyone no one has to

00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,380
pick up the tab for pizza and beer just

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,810
announced to whatever your communication

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,360
route is hey everyone in the South

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,610
Philly area next Saturday at 11 o'clock

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,570
we're gathering at this cafe new

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,730
contributors welcome and if you want new

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,220
contributors new contributor events

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,250
again run similar to that very casual

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,810
hack vests are great almost every single

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,250
person who shows up to a new contributor

00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,780
event by the way according to my

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,630
research turns into a drive-through

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,730
contributor and that's awesome because

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,830
they are a contributor and you have

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,570
their contribution so they've made a

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,820
contribution to open source you have

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,710
helped them you have a contribution that

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,780
is a win-win-win situation so drive

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,000
through or new contributor events are

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,070
marvelous for drive throughs you also

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,110
can do process improvements tagging

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,270
starter bugs helps with those people who

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,090
like you they really like you also

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,870
having a contributor SLA Allah you know

00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,970
if you give us a patch we will do our

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,100
damndest to get you a review within 5

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,600
days you don't know how motivating that

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,560
is because I know I'm guilty of

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,730
receiving patches and just ignoring them

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,679
while

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,450
people want to contribute when they look

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,179
at my list of PRS and they've been

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:32,150
sitting there for six months no no no no

00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:33,770
so try to have an SLA of some variety it

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,380
really helps people show up and give you

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,320
their code and also who wants to sit

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,900
around and a glorious Melbourne sunny

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,590
Sunday spending the entire afternoon

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,990
downloading the entirety of pypy I know

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,660
buddy we have technology for this

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:53,990
problem we can make a container or a

00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,190
virtual machine image that will allow

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,040
people to be up and running and

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,830
contributing within hours rather than

00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,580
days this does come with a maintenance

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,840
overhead so it might not it might end up

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,760
being too much work for you and your

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,380
project in your needs please ask your

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,630
doctor if containers are right for you

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:15,770
so culture there are a lot of things

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,350
that can be done with culture in order

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:22,190
to make it better and more accepting to

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:25,340
drive through contributors all of these

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:29,120
things must be led by example by the

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,640
core contributors first of all value

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,679
contributions value contributors say

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,250
thank you I shouldn't have to say this

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,350
but unfortunately I keep having to

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,000
foster a culture of documentation show

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,490
people you really care about Doc's right

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,049
the docs yourself that's a really good

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,669
way to show people that you as a core

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,440
contributor care about Doc's

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,970
if you see something that needs to be

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,190
docked and you don't have time how about

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,440
you can quickly whip up cut and paste a

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,510
an issue in your issue tracker for that

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,340
remember when I said that most Drive

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,500
Thru contributions are doc fixes and

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,840
that most people who are drive through

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,330
contributors love your project and just

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,559
want to contribute in some small way

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,419
guess what these two are chocolate and

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,370
peanut butter because you've got low

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:12,919
hanging duck bugs you've got people who

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,120
really want to fix them so combine these

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,010
two but you can't do that if you don't

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,320
foster a culture of documentation and

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:23,270
also helping others must be seen as they

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,400
raison d'être it should not be seen as a

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,679
distraction from the real work helping

00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,500
others in your project is the real work

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,690
default to assistance when people show

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,040
up don't assume that they're just going

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,720
to leave and so they don't deserve your

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,460
time they want

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,730
to give you something for free they

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,840
deserve your time and then we have

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,610
outreach express gratitude and then

00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,100
follow up if you do get drive-through

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,909
contributors we've got the I haven't

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,460
coded full time since what 2007 I can

00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:57,679
write a script to pass my get and my

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,320
commits and figure out who I have seen

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,370
and who I have not and then I can reach

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,490
out to them because I have their email

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:07,130
addresses and I can say hey you know

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,419
what was it like to contribute was it

00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,309
good was it bad was there anything I can

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,169
change and why did you leave because if

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,730
I don't ask I'm never gonna know I'm

00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,230
just gonna be sitting there saying I've

00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,510
got this many Drive Thru contributors

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,520
but not knowing how to convert them into

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:23,360
community members and not knowing how to

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,929
fix my process to get more and finally

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:34,280
Institute ain't no rule full

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:36,080
stop now that does not mean to become

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,030
the yourself while you are

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,890
enforcing this please be empathetic but

00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:43,039
firm there are lots of resources out

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:46,880
there for this so I do encourage you to

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,590
go look them up I'm running short on

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,049
time so I do want to make sure I dog

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,030
food and give my own gratitude as I said

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:55,909
I did speak with a lot of people about

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,580
this a very few of them consented to be

00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,220
publicly thanked so these are those

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,530
people thank you people I spent a lot of

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,299
time speaking with all of them there are

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,850
also a lot of people who are not on this

00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:10,880
list they get equal pairs in the

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,650
gratitude pool here a couple of people

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,940
in the very early stages of this talk

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,059
which I have now given like five times

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,039
reviewed the slides I want to thank

00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,700
those my dear friends jean hack and our

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,890
beloved krishna Gebauer back here and

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,330
then my friend Steve Wally is just

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,150
always an inspiration to me every time I

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,340
have a conversation with him and we

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,539
chatted about this months months and

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,990
months ago and then I was off to the

00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,350
races

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,850
so there are image credits because it's

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,799
the right thing to do you can find these

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:44,990
in the slides which are available right

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:47,600
