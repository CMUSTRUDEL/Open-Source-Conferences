okay quick recap for those of you

00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,450
lightning talks are five minute talks

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,919
that people have signed up for on the

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,780
board out near the registration desk

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,509
they go for five minutes that is

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,230
strictly enforced by way of this time at

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,510
just here please do not count down when

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,020
we get to ten seconds despite whatever

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,570
compulsion might urge you to do so what

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,510
we can do however is once we get to say

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,609
three seconds or so left do some micro

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,610
applause like this can we do this to

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,550
practice wonderful and then when it gets

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,129
to when it gets to flashing red and says

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,960
zero burst into spontaneous applause

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:48,510
such that you cannot hear the person

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:50,370
speaking wonderful people at the back

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,079
running the AV once you hear that

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,840
spontaneous applause please cut off

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,100
their slides so we have a quite a number

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,629
of talks to get through so we're going

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,210
to cycle through these relatively

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,680
quickly our first presenter is Graham

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,540
dumbarton who's going to be telling us

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,700
about parallel processing in the cloud

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,700
with Jupiter start now

00:01:36,940 --> 00:02:26,980
I mean to bring it up that's the bit I

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,230
missed off the end so I've got my driba

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:37,780
to cluster here again I login you with

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:39,160
my password and i'll get this up problem

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,450
is either you can't see the clock so you

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,760
have no idea how I'm just going to take

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:50,680
three minutes 30 left i'm going to

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:54,940
upload a japan notebook see uploading

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,700
you said uploading ok so it is working

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,709
now in the meantime over here i ran up

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,600
my cluster and you just also run up i

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,970
now have an ipod pipe from parallel

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,590
cluster i'm actually I've got one

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,760
controller and I've got one engine but

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm actually going to spin this up to

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,090
eight just like this now that's going to

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,790
start bringing in all those extra

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,050
engines Sophie familiar of this that's

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,940
all registering with the controller i

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,250
have already eight engines that I have

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,930
now basically a system which has got a

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,010
total of ten processes running across I

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,860
don't know how many machines probably

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,739
four and I can just go in here and I can

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,340
start going through here and it's

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:36,310
showing up eight engines and I can just

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,860
keep going down here no keep going down

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,500
eight engines and eventually I'll get

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,760
down heats my task which is going to run

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,680
my task and give you a nice pretty graph

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,420
this one's just going to randomly I

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,830
guess put data across this not in

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,900
balance one

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,370
there's my graph I've immediately done

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,200
my job across and I can just keep going

00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,120
and this one happens to be doing a load

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,800
balanced view so that it very quickly

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,410
just a few minutes I've spun up a knife

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,750
in notebook instance either then gone

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,489
and done I pipe a parallel cluster I've

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,319
you saw that I've spun up to eight

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,520
engines all very quickly and that's all

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,140
running without if that's just something

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,120
i'm playing with it moment if you're

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,720
interested in all in that come and talk

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:22,490
to me and that there that there was an

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,230
example quite a good lighting talk

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,030
because he didn't use the full five

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,790
minutes efficient lightning talks are

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,550
good lightning talks thanks gran so up

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,750
on deck over here we have Alexia kanya

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,150
roof and here we have Kiran who's going

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,200
to be telling us about multi-node actor

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:47,570
and the morazÃ¡n talise scalable actors

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,160
in Python please start don't fathom the

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,990
stars of waste there five minutes right

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:58,100
so um it's right into it erlang who

00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:04,160
hears familiar with it the corner of the

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:09,260
room I I a lot of people here well yeah

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,500
it's built on this methodology is actor

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:17,960
model framework very good for scaling

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,760
out horizontally so yeah pluses you're

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,310
gonna scales it's lightweight and it

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:29,270
scales negatives it's a little bit

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:35,960
unreliable past sixty nodes it's near on

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:39,229
unreadable and it's not Python so can we

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:45,500
have our teepee for Python oh look pulsa

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:47,180
amazing amazing library yeah I like it

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,120
does scale horizontally but you need

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,130
Redis back end and I just want my

00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:00,470
peer-to-peer so over the course of the

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:02,979
weekend now we can thursday to now kind

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:08,000
of inspired by the I of T mini comp I

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:11,800
wrote the whole EMP EPMD system which is

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,229
the underlying layer beneath OTP in

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:21,349
Python so yay it works on a very script

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:25,159
down jerry-rigged Fork of pulsar it's

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:30,200
got a lot of bugs and that's the shell

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:37,370
script I used to generate my docs so

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:41,530
demo time this is a little bit nicer

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:46,490
than the actual package code itself but

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,440
we're pulling in the following in the

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:52,210
package actor node link node link

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,820
establishes a connection between nodes

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,409
since our first server and when it will

00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,919
receive when it receives a message it

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,390
just prints it out second server

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,060
connects up to our first server and sent

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:11,360
our world which the first serve up and

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:14,810
sell so hello world in OTP Oh life

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,820
example hope it doesn't crash enter a

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:23,419
few times we can't read the top line of

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:30,370
text oh cool yes I am in the right

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:33,710
directory that's not very readable is it

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:39,370
who does anyone know then plus command +

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,370
cool I haven't used a mac in a while so

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:48,900
oh do have plenty of time cool I can't

00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:51,749
go through this right goes through

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,479
written the same framework goes through

00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:58,990
lists of numbers pulls out the odd ones

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:02,789
and create a actor from the even ones

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:21,849
that should be the expected output and

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:23,949
if we run that whoa so it worked that is

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:33,579
yes that is the one that I was also cool

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:37,060
right so it's a little bit more that's a

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:43,659
little bit more detail than the hello

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:50,949
world example basically we've got a one

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:52,720
minute yep so create some actor when the

00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:56,230
actor receives something prints it out

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,790
and basically the apt is named Michael

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:04,600
so michael says whatever message and

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:13,720
some cheating movie coats well no I

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:17,800
don't want to do that cool that all

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,110
works and yeah as you can tell from my

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:26,860
director lift I did have a few more a

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:38,130
few more examples but as you can see no

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:38,130
output bugs so that's the end of my demo

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:51,950
yay uh so up on deck we have Sam and

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,180
here we have Alexi who is going to be

00:09:51,950 --> 00:10:03,050
telling us about a get as Lego he'll

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:06,050
start there's that yep okay so i'm alexi

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:11,740
ah i worked con code and i work with get

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,740
and I wish I didn't have to see this ah

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,850
so i'll be telling you why if you ever

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:22,340
had these questions then i'll try to put

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,700
try to put up a model which will help

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,560
you answer this question like what is

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,380
image do some of the base help me now

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:35,390
how do you get people not swear at my

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,710
pull request so we all make files we put

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,350
them there and then we put them in

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,820
version control this is a lie I will

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,120
tell you more for I will tell you more

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,590
lies about get which have a convenient

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,240
so what we actually do is we put changes

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,600
we have an empty state of the bottom and

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,300
when we put our we commit some files and

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,680
we have a committee which I'll represent

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,480
as Lego blocks we have more files and we

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,970
make another commits which goes on top

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,100
of the other committee so now we have

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,200
more files and the blocks fit together

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,440
where there is a parent and that is a

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,580
next committee they all fit together

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,090
nicely and that is your branch you can

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,060
have more branches which kind of go

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:26,800
different directions and then they

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,360
diverge and they and then you want to

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,190
make sense of it like you want to merge

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,810
them or you want to base them what you

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:39,040
don't even know that just like set my

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,040
changes please this is not good

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,670
yep you can see Suri is right so if you

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,740
want to make a merge you just push the

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,320
thing on top which feeds both of them

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,750
and has not some kind of container

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,540
though so you can see that you have to

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:02,050
have some kind of changes that feeds

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,839
master on the bottom and it has the

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,930
shape you want the files you want on top

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,650
and you have to have some changes that

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:17,860
feed the feature and have the same scene

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:21,970
on top if you want to rebase you just

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,150
take that take the branch and try to put

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:28,060
it on top of master where does not fit

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,700
it will help you put it there and is

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,950
that commit wheelchair will somehow put

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:38,580
there and then the next one doesn't fit

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:42,190
cool so let's assume that you've done it

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,710
but sometimes you want you see you saw

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,690
seen the manuals that sell use that you

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,730
want it an interactive rebase or

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,110
something else you need an interactive

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,690
your base at what you're doing is this

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,250
just really enjoy everything and put

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,950
them in some random order which you want

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,810
and try to make them fit of course they

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,810
don't fit you get to resolve conflicts

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,500
if you imagine you have to resolve

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,100
conflicts want to get this one block

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,589
right if you are amazing you get to do

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,990
it all the time for each blog that

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,670
you're trying to put on top of them if

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,529
you're squashing can meet someone asked

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,490
me was watching commit means that's the

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:25,110
easiest part you have more you have more

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,110
than one commits you get one commit

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,660
let's actually oh I hope this under this

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,540
helps you understand what get kameez do

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,450
and why merge your base and anything

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,600
works like they like they work and I

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,600
hope you don't do this thank you Oh

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,390
thanks oh thanks LXE for your talk up on

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:54,180
deck we have Martin Schweitzer and on my

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,440
right we have Sam kitajima Kimbrel who's

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,630
going to tell us that we are not

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,860
Facebook except for those people in this

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,920
room who action are actually from

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,950
facebook sorry is yeah yeah yeahs

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,620
politics that's also ok all right hi I'm

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,200
Sam I work at Tulio we were sort of big

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,280
but we are still not Facebook I'll open

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,620
this with a quote from Kell Henderson

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:19,530
which is percent of websites are not in

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,820
the top 1% of websites this is uber new

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,320
data storage architecture it's called

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,870
schema-less the blog post on our

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,460
fascinating reading but inside of it

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,710
where it almost certainly something like

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,330
this they have a team of a dozen

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,630
engineers whose full-time job is to

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,440
support this thing you don't so let's

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,970
talk about what you should be thinking

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,550
about rather than how you're going to

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,710
scale 1 billion users so first up let's

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,180
talk about picking technologies

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,530
databases web frameworks metric systems

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,360
JavaScript frameworks you can find an

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,160
open source implementation for just

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
about everything here's how you should

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,090
evaluate them and pick one older tools

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,830
are often better they've show up to the

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,330
test of time and every scar that they

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,790
have from Battle Damage is a lesson you

00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,870
don't have to relearn on the flip side

00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,400
though make sure you look at that

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,900
projects commit history is it being

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,690
actively maintained by people who are

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,040
not the company that originally wrote it

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,210
the big name Apache foundation projects

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,700
are really the gold standard here so a

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,760
Hadoop kafka leucine activemq all that

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,350
great stuff security how many CVEs

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
exists for this project how quickly are

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,610
they patched how hard is it going to be

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,410
roll-to-roll updates if you need to the

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,370
project ecosystem how it's sensible is

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,440
this thing if you want to add new

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,120
functionality do client libraries exists

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,080
for your chosen language platform are

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,390
people talking about those on stack

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,580
overflow and this is something I

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,320
borrowed from Josh this morning the

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,610
out-of-the-box enos like what's the

00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,380
friction to get going with this thing

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,670
how it's the first 30 minutes of when

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,930
you install it with pip or when you

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,940
download the package and install on your

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,440
servers what does local development to

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,350
get this thing look like how do you test

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,780
with it documentation does it exist is

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,350
it up to date it's a comprehensive is it

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,120
discoverable do support contracts is

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,800
this for a thing are there consulting

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,420
companies when your post grace instance

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,860
fails at 1am and you can't restore from

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,140
your backup you're going to want help

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,600
and finally look for landmines in the

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,950
licensing terms up for example the GPL

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
is actually incompatible with the terms

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,190
on the App Store so in your library you

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,640
use in your iOS app needs to be licensed

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,900
under something else okay next let's

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,730
talk about infrastructure as a service

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,050
there are companies out there building

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,610
posted solutions for just about

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,770
everything to rattle off a few and these

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,030
are not endorsements if you want metrics

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,160
collection and monitoring idata dog

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,140
sacrifi robar bug stag for capturing

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,790
errors and logs Travis and circle CI for

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,040
testing and obviously github and get

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,600
labs resource control everything you can

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,770
pay somebody else to do is something you

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,350
don't have to solve a build and maintain

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,510
yourself and finally few closing

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,950
thoughts your customers are likely to be

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,950
more forgiving than you think your

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,150
outages are survivable just communicate

00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,590
under-promise and over-deliver they'll

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,510
be even more forgiving if you haven't

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,160
promised them five nines up if you don't

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,010
know the math here five nines is five

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,250
point two six minutes of downtime per

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,750
year and finally please please please

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,270
please think of disaster recovery before

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,770
you have a disaster a biggest question

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,270
answer here is how big of a failure do

00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,950
you need to tolerate ruk with your

00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,470
service going down if Amazon loses one

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,060
AZ you probably should be famines on

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,730
loses an entire region that's debatable

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,460
and test your dr plan before you have to

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,700
do it under fire you'll thank me later

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,700
happy building

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,049
thanks Sam now for those of you who

00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,699
might think about doing a lightning talk

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:25,059
tomorrow you'll see that there's a board

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:27,130
out there with it'll have some cards on

00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,630
it around eight-thirty there aren't any

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,910
there please don't put new talks up

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,080
there yet but one of the cards suggest

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,809
you should probably put your name down

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,789
along with your talk title and I have

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,280
another person who has kind of not put

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:42,789
their name down so if you were card

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,900
number six you should come and or should

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,919
I just tell them what they actually talk

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,190
was about because they might not

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,830
remember we should do that okay so if

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,480
your talk was a vs code for Python and

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,020
your handwriting looks like this you

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,730
should come and set up on my left here

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,740
we have march right so who's going to be

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:05,230
telling us about elegant string searches

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:07,390
and your time starts now okay hi this is

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,970
a talk I gave it to Melvin Melbourne

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,409
python user group meeting about four

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,030
years ago and one of the organizers

00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:15,220
asked me if I'd to actually give this

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,809
book again as a lightning talk problem

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,130
was the first talk was about 20 minutes

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,710
I'm going to have to speak really

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,179
quickly now ok it's all soft with a

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,220
little problem i had it was writing a

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,750
little online game it's where you have

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,700
non characters and you've got to guess

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,080
the magic word so if you look at those

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,309
non characters some people will

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:37,360
immediately guess it he has a clue said

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:39,190
word is chocolate and the standard way

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,590
of doing this is you go through the

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,850
letters you order them you go through a

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,740
dictionary you've got a dictionary of

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,350
words you won't find out all the words

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,970
you can make from the web chocolate and

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:52,270
let's hotel you thought those letters

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,429
yet added it really tricky so then I had

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,679
I was programming this I was looking for

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:58,240
an easy way out and I remember this

00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,980
thing I learnt in probably when I was

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,080
eight years old at school I think

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,080
everybody's learnt it it's called the

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,000
fundamental theorem of arithmetic if

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,010
you've forgotten it it says every

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,600
natural number greater than 1 can be

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,240
written as a unique product of prime

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,059
numbers if you're not if you're still a

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,360
bit uncertain we can take a number like

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:22,260
1729 but brownie points if you know why

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:28,059
I've chosen that number and that's seven

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,970
well done 7 x 13 x 19 and there's no

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,470
other prime

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,640
that we can multiply together to get

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,890
1729 we can try 23 or 11 or what of it

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,669
it's not going to happen fundamental

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:44,270
theorem says no okay 36 is 2 times 2

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:48,650
times 3 times 3 no other prime numbers

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,080
are going to give you thirty six so the

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,700
fundamental insight that I had is if we

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,909
think of each letter of the alphabet is

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:59,750
a scrabble tile and we give each one at

00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:02,840
prime so a is always 2 b's or easy is 5

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,590
etc we go up to 26 letters 101 is the

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,590
prince x prime number we take something

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:13,880
like a BBA 2 times 3 times 3 times 2 is

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:17,600
36 what this means is we can rearrange

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,090
them anyhow we want ba ba will also give

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,429
us 36 no matter how we arrange those

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,860
letters will always get 36 so that's

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,370
fantastic but the next thing that we

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:32,150
figure is we if we remove a letter so

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:35,030
we've got bab it's 18 and 18 will always

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,890
be a factor of 36 no matter how many

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:40,370
letters we remove it will always be a

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:44,480
factor if we take a letter like d which

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:47,929
is 73 times 2 times 7 is 42 no way will

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,169
42 ever go into 36 fundamental theorem

00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:54,169
says sir fantastic so does chocolate

00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:56,360
fontaine cocoa let's use mathematics and

00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,720
parvin to figure this out so we take

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:04,700
chocolate 5 x 19 x 47 times 5 times

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:10,940
edited using Python trivial it's that

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,710
number so what about Coca well Coco is

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:18,860
five times 47 well that's a much easier

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:21,020
one its 110,000 450 so if 110,000 450

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,140
divides into the top number without a

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,090
remainder well let's use path and once

00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,380
again I've found the remainder when we

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:34,150
divided 0 we have used python to prove

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,150
their chocolate contains coker

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,950
but so basically I wanted to write a

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,440
program that does it I used prime

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,050
numbers I this is the program

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,660
represented at 34 years ago and it was a

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,250
bit complex figured hang on if i use a

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,830
dictionary it's going to be much easier

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,050
rather than taking the order of a and

00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,700
subtracting it or subtracting the letter

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:04,790
so i did that that function says given a

00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:09,830
word while and then it's number is at

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:14,060
one minute fantastic so much simpler

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:18,110
program yes my final program this works

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:21,230
and just to prove that it works we will

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:27,260
cut it there it is less than a page of

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:29,030
code and let's try running it you use

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,680
chocolate they're all the letters that

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,970
can be made from the word or all the

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,830
words that can be made from the letters

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,830
in chocolate thanks very much

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:47,280
oh thank you thank you thank you martin

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,440
i'm slightly hungry at this point ah Don

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,720
right I should rather than the car

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,780
throat uh so up on this side we have

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,730
Katie so if you can come set up and Don

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,340
is going to tell us about vs code for

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,010
Python your time starts now yes hi

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,809
everyone um anyone here who's using

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,320
Visual Studio code for Python

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:10,860
development just few just underpin and

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,929
you're in using Adam Oh block know okay

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,150
now if you're using Adam I would

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,580
strongly recommend you get Visual Studio

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,740
code ago what is visual studio could it

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,309
is very similar to Adam it's a

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,780
cross-platform editor for multiple

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:29,130
languages it's developed in nodejs and

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,510
by the way it's developed by Microsoft

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,510
so that's where it's called Visual

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:37,830
Studio code it supports multiple

00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:40,230
languages c-sharp Python JavaScript c++

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,470
and a couple of others now out of the

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,840
box what do you get is support for get

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,470
support for you get intellisense

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,990
colorization and plenty of those things

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,460
you know what i would like to present is

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,610
using this editor along with the plugin

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,890
that are built for python development

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:02,309
now as I mentioned earlier I would

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:05,340
suggest you give this editor ago is

00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:07,230
because if you're using Adam you will

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,970
find this as much more far more powerful

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:14,130
than Adam why let's have a look at the

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,320
features of this particular extension

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,780
now if you look at Python extension it

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,420
supports linting supports intellisense

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,500
auto indenting code formatting code

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,570
refactoring rename extracting variables

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,340
a couple of other features such as code

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:35,059
navigation you can find all of the

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:37,860
references you can view signatures and

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:42,000
something that Adam doesn't really

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,900
support very well is debugging I believe

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,810
someone created an extension for anatomy

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,970
for debugging on Python but that uses

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,549
it's basically a wrapper around pdb and

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:57,389
i know how well that works basically

00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:59,309
it just sucks so this one's a little bit

00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:02,820
more intelligent if not a lot more it

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:04,710
supports well it supports pretty much

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,090
everything you would need in de Barral

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,039
when you're debugging Python you've got

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,279
multi-threaded debugging stack traces

00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,409
expanding values you can do remote

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,700
debugging as well so you can give up

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:19,649
Django pipe now flask applications and

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,860
now apart from all of that then there is

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:26,340
support for unit testing as well and

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:29,730
snippets so as I mentioned earlier this

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:34,529
is something that is cross-platform it's

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,929
MIT licensed open source so I know not

00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,359
many people like Microsoft but this is

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,980
open source and it is MIT license so you

00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,109
can if you don't like Microsoft just

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:49,440
 it build it on your own machine and

00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:51,899
keep it to yourself now the extension

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,029
that I built is just geared towards

00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:56,159
Python development right now it is the

00:25:54,029 --> 00:26:00,210
second most popular extension in the

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,159
market and it's well it's been only

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:07,889
there for just under six months and it's

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,899
up to over 300,000 downloads so if we

00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:11,940
were to just have a quick look at at the

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:14,159
peaches you can see over here I've just

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,480
downloaded some source code just from

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,779
online just to show some of the features

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,129
you've got input and you put in sis dot

00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,399
you've got all of the intellisense

00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:25,139
that's fine yes adam has that and PI

00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:27,029
charm are with the others so what we

00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:28,529
have is are there you go linting kicks

00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,330
in and you get to see all of the details

00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:34,080
for instance if you've got errors you

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:36,840
just type in some garbage you can see

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:41,639
the error messages as well so let's take

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,369
know that oops you've got code

00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:46,049
navigation to code navigation across the

00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,820
file within the file for instance you

00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:50,850
want to look at max price you can go to

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,950
the definition go to definition they go

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,359
and then it goes to line number 18

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,279
because that's where it's been defined

00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,179
if it was across multiple files all

00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,669
across packages that would work as well

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:05,100
let's have a look at one minute if we

00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:06,720
would have a look at debugging I think

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,080
that's where this really outshines most

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,570
of

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,510
the other editors because it is really

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,860
powerful you can see debugging in here

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,309
and on your left hand side you can see

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:22,309
all of the values you can expand on the

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:28,200
values and obviously it supports

00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:30,929
breakpoints and yes so this could go on

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,330
and we could as I mention you can debug

00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:37,320
flask Django multiple applications

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:40,830
google app engine as well so where's it

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,110
going forward well Microsoft are really

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,880
interested in this plug-in so there's

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:49,409
plenty of support from Microsoft as well

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:53,250
and it's being I'll be extending it to

00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:58,169
support debugging of applications in the

00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:05,639
cloud amazon google plus already that's

00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:07,679
it okay uh so over the side are we have

00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:12,120
jeremy epstein if you could come and set

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,580
up please and oh is this an ad No okay

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,019
good it's not an ad that would be a

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,610
problem if it were because we don't like

00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,590
ads here but it's not mad at the post

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,330
conference report Oh excellent excellent

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,980
okay well sounds like you're talking so

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,110
Katie's talking about Katie Connor hi

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:29,399
I'm Katie who here has heard about Katie

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:31,049
comp before now that's awesome okay so

00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,330
Cody conf is a small conference that I

00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,100
ran a couple of weeks ago we had two

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,779
tracks and 38 different speakers we had

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,019
a que track and a tee track it was

00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:43,320
amazing ah the purpose of Katie comp is

00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:45,330
we had a compliance entirely dedicated

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,529
to speakers who were called Catherine

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,940
okay or Cathy or Karina we do promote

00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:53,399
diversity your name could start with

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,710
either a seat or okay as long as it was

00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:57,659
from the root Catherine we had a lot of

00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,980
amazing speakers including some names

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,019
familiar to this community including

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,269
Kathy Ricky Bell who's here Katie

00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,690
Cunningham Chapman and Katherine Pierce

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:09,570
we also had a stroke ad which is awesome

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,399
we had Caterina from NPM we also had be

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,830
Rob's oh my gosh we had a nuclear

00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,169
engineer professor k Duffy it was

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,210
amazing we had a whole lot of different

00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:20,850
topics going on we had robots DevOps

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,100
security aliens poetry and automation

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:26,250
held it out in a Katherine small town in

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,910
northern Turkey and this was all couple

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:35,480
of weeks ago on jun 30 first 30 days has

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:38,970
September april june and november yeah i

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,710
am not sorry for this at all not a lot

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,000
of people actually read the website and

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,720
scrolled right down to the bottom that

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,010
said that katie conf was a parody um

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,200
there were a few people that were really

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:55,650
upset that I didn't actually do this

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:57,420
including Swift on security fun the

00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,400
thing is I also had people on the

00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,590
internet ask well why don't we do a Dave

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:08,970
con for a steve conf and I just said

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:11,310
we'll go to any other conference I I've

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,690
attended conferences with absolutely no

00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:16,020
female speakers I've been the only

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:18,600
female speaker at a conference and it's

00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,430
as I've been pulled into the last minute

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,610
to try to improve their image and that's

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,350
not the point the point is people of

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,690
different genders have very different

00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:30,270
life experiences and career experiences

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,800
perspectives on what they've done and

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,420
what they can do a greater range of

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,590
topics and framing is more valuable to

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:41,370
everyone kareena de sousa who did the

00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:43,410
keynote at PyCon last year wrote that

00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,240
and she's absolutely right there have

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,460
been so many amazing talks this week and

00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,420
I mean even just today in the last

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,700
couple of days and there's going to be

00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,770
even more amazing talks and it's because

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,050
of everyone's different experiences that

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,490
we can all learn from each other this

00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,050
year there are about twenty to

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,810
twenty-five percent of the talks of

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,640
parkland aur by female speakers at PyCon

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,490
us it was forty percent same with Django

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,110
con us Django con Europe was fifty two

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,930
percent female speakers and that is

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,930
fantastic and I think that we need to

00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,989
the Django and Python communities get

00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:21,049
this right and I wish that more people

00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:22,879
listened real-world effects there have

00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:26,809
been talks about running an anaconda

00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:28,700
Sarah conf but just can't is a thing

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:31,369
that's going to be held on Jessie island

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:36,019
off the coast of Queensland on November

00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:37,849
31st 35 this is run by a just frazzle

00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,779
previously of Dhaka now of Google which

00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:45,409
is absolutely fantastic however pycon UK

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:48,049
have got a 500-pound scholarship

00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:49,729
dedicated to Katie conf speakers or

00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:52,129
people call Katie as part of their

00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:56,509
diversity outreach and that is

00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:58,849
absolutely real and it's fantastic so

00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:04,690
how much time do I have left a one

00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:09,950
minute to 25 24 23 that was Katie conf

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:14,619
2016 Katie cough 2017 has been submitted

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,619
as a Linux conf Australian mini-con

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,679
we're planning to have an entire day

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,539
full of speakers of speakers at a called

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,169
Catherine including this year middle

00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:31,269
names just into Catherine Richardson and

00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,509
Lana Catherine bring Lee who you may

00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:37,799
know are helping me run this and if we

00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:39,850
get accepted it's going to be awesome

00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,009
linux conf is going to be run in the

00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,779
middle of January next year go to the

00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:46,240
website links comedy are you it's going

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:48,639
to be awesome there's a twitter handle

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,620
there's the website because XYZ domains

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,250
were cheap and also call back women is

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,570
an amazing service run by karina who

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,519
publishes and publicizes are female

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,440
speakers and conferences who promote

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:06,309
diversity in their speakers thank you

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:08,500
very much yeah thank you thank you for

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,769
that talk and I think if you can run an

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:14,230
entire conference are filled with filled

00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:16,450
with people named named Katie they've

00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,159
really should be no excuse for not

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,750
having you at least one woman per

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,610
session in every talk at every

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,009
conference and it should be something we

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:27,820
should be aiming for hopefully even

00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:29,769
greater than that now card number 11 has

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,659
again failed to put their name on the

00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:33,659
thing and sounds like they're talking

00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:36,190
about an idea again this seems like a

00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:40,509
butt so if you're talking about cloud 9i

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:42,490
de come and set up over here and over

00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:44,289
here we have a jeremy epstein who's

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:51,009
going to be telling us about putting all

00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:56,620
the bits on pi PI okay so hi I'm Jeremy

00:33:51,009 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm from iris and yes take more bits out

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:05,220
of your code bases and put them ideally

00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:09,250
on public pi PI if you never heard but

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:11,369
pi pi is the thing that pip install goes

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,950
to to look for things to install

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:18,339
packages from so ideally put things on

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,290
pi PI or if you really can't I'm not

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:23,649
allowed to etc you can even create your

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:29,159
own private pi PI in your organization

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:32,079
or whatever so most code bases are

00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,679
bigger than they need to be most code

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,530
bases

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,760
have bits of code that are general

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:44,919
utility things that that could be reused

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:49,450
in future so ideally they could be taken

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:53,349
out and put in separate packages so just

00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:55,780
want to quickly give some examples last

00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:59,490
year on a project I was working on I

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,410
went through a bit of a craze of

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,470
component izing the project of pulling

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:09,069
out bits and putting them in separate

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:12,940
packages so just want to say it's not

00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:16,869
that hard to do and it has benefits and

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:18,910
if you have time at the end of a

00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,010
projector at the end of iteration

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:29,650
whatever you should really think about

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:33,040
doing it so so here's an example of a

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:38,069
project a little utility thing that I

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:42,609
put up on pi PI it's got a corresponding

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:45,309
github repo is it that useful for other

00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:48,510
people it's for this app I was working

00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:53,819
on last year called simpler and it's

00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:56,349
just for putting nvd three graphs in

00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:58,270
maybe will be useful for other people

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,069
other people can now fork it if they

00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:03,630
want can now just install it with people

00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:07,839
install if they want I think that's cool

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:11,500
so if you're not able to put things up

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,980
on public pi PI I didn't know this

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,140
before I tried it maybe not everyone

00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:20,980
here knows it but you can actually

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:24,579
create your own private Python repo and

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,690
configure get to point to it and install

00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:32,950
your own private pip packages if you're

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:35,349
interested I've got a little guide that

00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,549
i put up as a gist on github there are

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:44,230
other instructions about how to do it

00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:46,440
really recommend it so why why do this

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,440
stuff

00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:58,560
yep smaller code bases are dead code

00:36:52,150 --> 00:37:02,490
bases if you're creating a bunch of

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:06,640
different different Python code bases

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:08,800
that use the same functionality you can

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:16,990
just in each new project you're working

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:20,800
on OOP install this utility done here's

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:23,680
another one called s3 saver might be

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,910
more useful it's up on github and pi PI

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:33,100
as well I wrote a blog post about it

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:36,730
last year as well read it if you're

00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:41,680
interested in this stuff it's got a cool

00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:45,700
picture of a snake if I them got picture

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,920
of Lego blocks as well splitting stuff

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:53,190
up into components like Lego blocks is

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,190
cool why and that's about it

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,890
okay I just need to look at your badge

00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,950
to see what your name is ok now can

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,839
introduce you over on this side we have

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,710
a key if you could come and set up

00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,869
here and on this side uh Samuel is going

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,760
to tell us about how no we can't install

00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:23,220
Python in browser development using

00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:26,099
cloud nine ide I had some funny slides

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,910
about you know stuff but the important

00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,079
thing is I'm here to tell you about

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,369
something that I've been using for all

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,470
of my development for about 12 months

00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:34,410
it's really cool it's called cloud 9i de

00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,849
I had joked slides about how awesome it

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,980
is to be working in an institute where

00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,990
you can run up a vm like today you can

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,250
scrap it up and you can install staff

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,619
and you can have like a million ideas

00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,059
all you want I didn't work in an

00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,730
environment like that I worked in a very

00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:49,290
lockdown environment cloud 9 idea is

00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,119
actually this really cool in browser

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,220
development suite where you can run a

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,450
virtual machine on a cloud instance and

00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,900
actually interact with it through the

00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,160
browser if yet so that's basically it's

00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,599
really really rad it's really really

00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,369
cool you check it out it's basically one

00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,980
of the most insane pieces attack that

00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,859
I've seen you can have full control you

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,869
have vim bindings eMac bindings a whole

00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,609
bunch of editor bindings debug

00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:13,440
everything in the cloud it's cool so we

00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:17,240
go and my computer died and i've lost my

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,240
power so if you see a power cord please

00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:26,109
oh that was the end so I was busy

00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:30,189
looking at my phone that was really

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:32,399
quick thank you okay on this side our

00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:35,769
Tony Breyer please come and set up and

00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:38,289
here we have amber brown hawky who's

00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:41,799
going to be telling us falsehoods that

00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:43,539
programmers have got it on the slide I

00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:46,299
can't see the slides I have a card in

00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:48,879
ogni okay don't start yet hang on hang

00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:51,509
on you know you can start okay hello I'm

00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:56,979
amber brown except for a ba ba ba so

00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:59,889
identity who knows what identity is so

00:39:56,979 --> 00:40:02,439
identity is basically a whole bunch of

00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:06,549
base yeah basically everything that

00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:09,699
makes up a person now a lot of people

00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:12,129
have a regular identity that is um sort

00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:14,949
of made at birth and it doesn't really

00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:18,039
change so who here in the room knows a

00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:21,939
transgender person there's not me okay

00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:24,429
so about 75% that's good okay so who

00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:31,109
knows someone that is of a non-binary

00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:34,329
gender okay good less now the thing is

00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:36,189
so the thing is that yet things change

00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:39,609
so these are the components that people

00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:43,449
generally accept makeup identity so

00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:46,719
let's start with the name so names

00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:50,259
change for these people quite often or

00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,869
at least more than once a once or more

00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:54,639
generally so for people that get married

00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:56,379
and then get divorced or maybe get

00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,259
remarried trans gender non-binary

00:40:56,379 --> 00:41:02,679
individuals and people who work on a

00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:04,809
pseudonymous spaces and hockey brownie

00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:06,429
is not my birth name and if your call me

00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:09,729
my birth name I will yell at you a lot

00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:12,249
so it's and when it's in systems that

00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:15,789
need to be updated it really really

00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:17,229
really makes me sad generally people

00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:18,549
think that this is a name you have a

00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:21,639
first name and middle name in the last

00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:25,599
name that is wrong this is on what it

00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:27,129
should be by Australian law and you know

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,299
people think that you know we can just

00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:30,339
get a name and we could just make it

00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:35,420
work everywhere but no names do not work

00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:37,549
that way that was alarming yes now

00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,040
yeah this this gets me riled up sorry

00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:42,380
but this is Australian common law here

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,140
you need a name and as soon as you

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:49,490
assume a name it is your legal name no

00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:52,160
exceptions that is Australian law let's

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,440
that lets go of gender tinder is not

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,240
binary gender is not constant for

00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,530
transgender people it may be binary it

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,819
may not be an gender in most things is

00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,190
something that you should not care about

00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:06,849
your service there's like uber for dogs

00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:12,799
does not need to care about my gender

00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:14,390
pronouns also does not equal gender sex

00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:16,250
also does not equal gender and we're not

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,619
really sure what that is because you

00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,240
know there's been research into this and

00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,299
it's it's not as clear-cut as people

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,920
think it is data perthnow her surely

00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:30,200
that can't change clerical errors

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:35,960
happens to lots of people also

00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:40,099
historical time zone changes nationality

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,589
now this seems relatively clear cut but

00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,599
countries merge and countries change and

00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:46,520
all of that sort of happens like for

00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,380
example Hong Kong it's like if you were

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,609
born in Hong Kong you were back in like

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,400
nineteen eighty you were like a British

00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:54,619
Susan except now if you are now you were

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,319
probably also a Chinese it's like four

00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:59,599
different countries that matter in

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:03,109
different things happen and you can't

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,180
just assume that it will never change so

00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:07,130
what does your application do wrong or

00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,780
Django does named wrong by default it

00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,200
has a first name and it has a last name

00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,599
this is wrong Facebook does names very

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,609
very very wrong in the case of requiring

00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,700
lots of transgender individuals to

00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:21,579
submit official ID as to that there that

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,990
is their name now for a lot of people

00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,339
especially in countries that are hostile

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,790
to that sort of thing like the United

00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:31,280
States they don't have that they get

00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:34,220
genders sort of right they have a text

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,140
box also Facebook say that they do treat

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,480
trans people transgender people better

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,369
they don't they lie about it and every

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,990
year or so they don't know where we're

00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,250
doing it right and then they did and

00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,880
then they close a couple of people's

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,539
accounts so you know every Australia

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,309
form does marriage is wrong

00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:57,479
minute because same-sex marriage should

00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:59,369
be a thing the only way to fix this is

00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:02,179
to have people that can detect these

00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,859
things and have a diverse developer base

00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:08,579
don't think that you know don't I don't

00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:10,769
know you don't know only by collective

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:14,339
basically everyone we can approach

00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:17,339
knowing now what are the consequences if

00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:19,109
you get this wrong denying a person

00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:23,669
their identity their true identity is

00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:26,099
denying them of humanity she only has 25

00:44:23,669 --> 00:44:29,160
seconds at every single level no matter

00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:32,309
how small it is you are denying them a

00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,259
part of their humanity they feel

00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:37,650
excluded they feel marginalized they

00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:42,079
feel upset and you need to do it right

00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,079
and not make assumptions thank

00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:52,130
alright I i think i think that was amber

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,549
Holcomb roun I think with with an

00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:58,910
important message over this side Mitch

00:44:55,549 --> 00:45:01,219
O'Neill and Tony Breyer is about to tell

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:10,339
us about his first Python and flask

00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:12,140
project okay um thanks for the

00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:13,910
introduction at the start of these talks

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:20,869
because I have to confess I'm a Delphie

00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:23,329
programmer so there you are and I am

00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,699
green tram software I'm the development

00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:27,919
team tech support office ship webmaster

00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:31,249
and everything else so one-person

00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:33,499
business been going 27 years not here I

00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:36,259
now live within walking distance of the

00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:38,539
convention center i come from UK still

00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:40,099
sell back to the UK and produce

00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:42,499
structural engineering programs that

00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:44,660
produce obscure stuff like this that i

00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:48,259
don't think even the users understand

00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,969
which is a bit worrying a couple of

00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:52,939
years ago there was a big worry on my

00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:56,239
part of everybody talking about tablets

00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:59,929
mobiles and the rest where I wasn't in

00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:05,329
it strictly a windows person so what to

00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:07,159
do about it building native applications

00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:10,159
because my user base is measured in the

00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:11,809
hundreds and never will be massive I

00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,729
didn't see as an option because you'd

00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:16,009
end up with three people on that

00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,929
platform and a dozen on that and the

00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:24,499
testing and development implications

00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:26,209
just wouldn't work the next course

00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:27,890
action being a Windows programmer was to

00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:31,989
investigate various ways of leveraging

00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:35,390
what i already had turning the core

00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:39,259
calculation units of my desktop

00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:41,269
application to int'l CG application the

00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:43,729
code then got laced with ifdef where

00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:45,549
been if dev desktop and like it got

00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:48,109
worse and worse than I abandon that

00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:50,179
delfi ships with a platform for building

00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:51,949
web apps called intraweb that's probably

00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:55,849
very good if they got somebody to do the

00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:58,609
documentation then I then I got

00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:00,259
desperate and decided that perhaps asp

00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,740
net was the way to go fortune I didn't

00:47:00,259 --> 00:47:04,490
buy visual

00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,220
studio but several asp offers the asp

00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,890
net book offers owe me a drink and then

00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,690
my isp wrote to me and said because i

00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,940
had a little test app just to make

00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,220
things work got in touch with it we're

00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,580
not doing windows hosting anymore it's

00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:22,970
at that point a rethink was necessary

00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:25,520
I'd done just a tiny bit of PHP does the

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,170
e-commerce interaction on my website but

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,990
being a Delphie programmer with stick

00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,510
type checking anything that lets you add

00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:37,430
an apple to and the fall for februari

00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:39,320
and get an answer is seriously inducing

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,150
therapy and from somewhere I don't know

00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,390
where I got the idea of going down the

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,040
Python route and I realized at that

00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,590
point before I did that I needed to

00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,390
think about hosting and came up with

00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,640
this this isn't they didn't pay me to

00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:56,030
tell you there's an outfit called Python

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,710
anywhere who do nothing but host pie

00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:01,360
from websites I wasn't going to get any

00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:03,380
funny looks or anything and they have

00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,359
been brilliant for me the fact that

00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:10,190
they're a British outfit so is beside

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:12,290
the point then I'm being an old guy like

00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,260
books made a paper size rolled into

00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:18,770
dymocks and strangely enough for a CBD

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:22,609
bookshop they had this book obviously

00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:24,590
with my name on it developing web

00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,350
applications with python and and that

00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:30,020
was just like gee this is what i need

00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:32,030
and i thought i understand how these

00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,119
decorators work but you know i look at

00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:39,530
that and like gee I understand this this

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,810
works for me and so a lot of hard work

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,730
because for 20 years I'd really just not

00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,770
learned anything very new just at more

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:49,940
and more Delphie so suddenly I had to

00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:54,080
get to grips with Python flask HTTR well

00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:57,220
you HTML javascript ajax and a whole

00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,220
load of other stuff and

00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:13,530
musical thank you this is the this is

00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:25,980
the result basically a web translation

00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:28,410
of what we have yeah we've got little

00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,270
project basically it's some JavaScript

00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:36,630
and AJAX on the client end and the back

00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:44,750
end is all Python and open a project and

00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:44,750
we've got steel beams and quick quick I

00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:58,830
know I'm running out of time that wasn't

00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,900
one with the Malcolm Turnbull says we

00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:04,010
live in exciting times when I started

00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,010
nearly 30 years ago

00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:14,849
okay hi I really love these stories

00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,349
about about how people have come to

00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:18,209
discover Python and this has been

00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:20,249
another one of those fantastic stories

00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:22,650
that invariably come up during our

00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:24,329
lightning talks now I've got two yellow

00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,410
cards which is very exciting because it

00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:27,049
means that the lightning talks in

00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:29,849
general have gone really really quickly

00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:32,640
Josh to pray you're up on up on deck

00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:34,469
here but first we have Mitch O'Neill

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,910
who's going to give us some high-risk

00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:41,819
demos I expect start cool hey I'm Mitch

00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:43,349
and a bit of a bit of a maniac so like

00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:45,719
you know I say things in conversation

00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:48,359
like a instead of calling a pai pai call

00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:50,339
a pie pie and things like that I know I

00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,779
know so anyway today I'm going to do a

00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,309
demo it's going to be a high risk maybe

00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:54,599
it'll work I think it will work but

00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:58,679
we're going to make it a bit tough so

00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,209
what the stunts going to be yes I have

00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,369
my laptop here set up and I've got some

00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:04,469
earbuds over there and on one side of my

00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:05,969
sailor i'm going to write some text and

00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,650
what's going to happen is this text is

00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:09,179
going to be encoded in two bites and my

00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,619
earbuds are going to send the signal at

00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,539
nine 10 kilohertz and my microphone is

00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:16,829
going to pick it up why am i using your

00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,999
buds for this I'm a maniac so that yeah

00:51:16,829 --> 00:51:19,589
the microphone will listen and will

00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:20,999
decode the bites back into text and then

00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:23,549
on the other side of the screen you'll

00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:27,029
be able to see the text show up what's

00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:28,829
the application of this who knows so

00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:30,299
uses the play audio library the peyote

00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,199
or library is amazing it integrates

00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:34,019
really well in a lot of different

00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,689
devices there's a github one and on top

00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:38,640
of that uses a quite net library by a

00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:42,150
contributor called katie i guess i will

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,829
call this contributor and katie says

00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,009
about the project i'm quite as just a

00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:48,509
toy take a look at mini modem or jen you

00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:50,279
radio if you need something robust this

00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:54,569
is a high-risk demo so this is a perfect

00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:56,519
feature that will need so it's a it's a

00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,900
clean implementation it's pretty simple

00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:59,219
there's no error correction there's no

00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,349
you know check sums and things like that

00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:04,409
things that you know in audio transfer

00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:06,179
we really really like this is the this

00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:08,189
is the keys that they agree on so how

00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:09,539
you can just translate into bites and

00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:13,679
I'll go back and forth this is the

00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:15,029
encode and decode and quite net it's you

00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:22,669
know really simple but really amazing

00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:22,669
and now it's time for the demo

00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:27,400
actually you guys don't even need to be

00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:29,560
that quiet it's just if anyone's

00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:35,290
transmitting at our 19 kilohertz I guess

00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:38,200
maybe you should be quiet yeah so we

00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,580
stopped yeah the same one and we get a

00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,460
terrible warning so that's a really good

00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:53,170
start it's exactly what we want and now

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:56,670
that's a code listen alrighty so

00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,670
hopefully I'm going to type in something

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:24,930
that's er quite netlibrary and I

00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:30,030
mentioned that's the talk Oh exactly it

00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:31,890
has excellent if anybody needed further

00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,480
proof that applause is completely

00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:38,420
incomprehensible I think Mitch's

00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,420
demonstration has shown that to us and

00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:31,589
can i bum till tomorrow oh whatever okay

00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:34,790
this is my favorite part oh yeah Heidi

00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:37,950
Waterhouse you should come and set up oh

00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:41,760
yeah sorry I was just enjoying this

00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:43,140
moment of slight schadenfreude er one of

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,390
these happens at every set of lightning

00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:51,630
talks no no juice well it's not showing

00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:53,849
so that's unfortunate um perhaps you can

00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,740
find someone else's laptop and present

00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:57,180
in a few minutes oh that's not gonna

00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,460
work either oh okay well that's

00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:04,230
unfortunate how much how much time do I

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:06,240
have left uh well I guess at the moment

00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,859
that's a great opportunity to deal with

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,530
some of the housekeeping that Richard

00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:12,450
told me I needed to deal with I'm going

00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,630
to try to remember most of it because I

00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:18,599
didn't actually write it down anywhere

00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:21,410
but at the conclusion of this there will

00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:25,050
be the conference dinner if you have a

00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:28,670
dinner icon on your badge you are

00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,670
entitled to go to the conference dinner

00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,970
or Sora still the circle on your badge

00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,040
if you have a silver surfer on your

00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,530
badge or a knife and fork then you are

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,930
able to go to the dinner there will be

00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:42,089
buses departing from just outside the

00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:44,849
Hilton Hotel which and you go downstairs

00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,960
you take a right and then sort of follow

00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:53,790
the the edge of the the plenary building

00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:58,080
around there Hey oh yeah well so well

00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:59,640
well I guess we should just restart this

00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,190
time because Heidi appears to be ready

00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,830
and a last lightning talk speaker will

00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:08,190
be our one known as iglesias if you can

00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:09,890
come and set up in the meantime a highly

00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,780
water house is going to tell us about

00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:17,460
indexing no it's like human indexing

00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,930
your time has started huh human indexing

00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,280
or how i learned to stop where

00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:24,720
ring and love the tag so this is a long

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,849
quote I'm not going to expect you to

00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,010
read it all but it turns out that Kurt

00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,900
Vonnegut in addition to being a really

00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,640
excellent technical writer did some

00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,490
science fiction work did you know that

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,109
it's amazing and he has this really

00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:39,359
beautiful bit in there about how

00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:42,809
important indexing is and how revealing

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:44,250
it is but i have to tell you guys you

00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:46,950
are not doing indexing you are doing

00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,930
concordance 'as concordance azhar when

00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:51,109
you set your search engine to look for

00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:54,300
all of the instances in the word an

00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:56,339
independent of its context you're just

00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:59,040
looking for the word there are large

00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:00,540
concordances that we use the the typical

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,849
place we think of them is biblical

00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,619
scholarship but really this is what

00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:06,450
we've we've designed as an entire

00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:10,410
internet full of concordance a--'s and

00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:13,800
not indexes there are a couple ways to

00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:16,890
organize a large pool of data like a

00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:20,190
large unmanaged pool of data one of them

00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:22,170
is taxonomy I'm going to derive all of

00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:24,150
my things from archive of our own which

00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:28,349
is a really great fan fiction site do

00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:30,329
not go to it if you feel like you might

00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:32,490
violate the conference code of conduct

00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:34,140
there are a lot of adults things on

00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,049
there you can set it to search for PG

00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,910
and g rated things but be careful how

00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:42,380
you search that don't don't do it right

00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:45,510
now next your neighbor I'm just saying

00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:47,460
so this is taxonomy because what we're

00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:49,349
doing is saying if you're looking for a

00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,200
fandom you can look within this fandom

00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:55,559
for all the things that we have we're

00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,089
organizing it from the top down the

00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,910
other thing that we're using and this is

00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:01,890
like librarianship battles that are

00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:04,530
raging right now and have been for a few

00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:06,869
years it's called folksonomy and that's

00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,359
when you allow people who are your users

00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:11,220
to do tagging for you and identify your

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:14,430
your data and tell you what it is

00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:17,970
because the the wisdom of the group mind

00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:20,040
right and you get really awesome tags

00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,650
and you can find a lot of sort of

00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:25,799
serendipitous and surprising things like

00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:28,380
I found a fan fiction about Tony Stark

00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:30,059
as a as a grad school ta teaching

00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,319
programming I'm looking forward to

00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:32,000
reading that one it looks like it's

00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:36,890
clean

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,750
um but the problem is it's really easy

00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:41,750
to fuss the system it takes very little

00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:45,860
action by a bad actor to really screw up

00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:49,070
a folksonomy system and so it that's

00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,980
that's a problematic thing so fan

00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:54,800
fiction has all these answers we've

00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:57,320
invested in a a volunteer position that

00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,660
we call tag wrangling where people

00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,040
submit tags and then other humans look

00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,790
at the tags and make sure that they are

00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,800
not in fact a slight but inaccurate

00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,870
duplicates of an already existing tag

00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,990
like that ever happens in programming

00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:15,250
right and they make sure that they're

00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:21,620
not like wildly inaccurate or offensive

00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:24,350
for the community standards so this is a

00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:27,110
set of tags that somebody has created

00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:30,100
the author has created some of them and

00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:33,020
then there are additional tags that

00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:35,090
other people can add on I think my

00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:39,350
favorite all-time archive of our own tag

00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:41,630
is Odin's a plus parenting so what does

00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:44,330
that mean for you as developers why do

00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,710
you care about fanfiction well search is

00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,810
king this is how we're finding

00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:50,510
everything and I know it and you know it

00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:53,840
and it's not like we're looking in

00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:55,850
beautifully collated indexes anymore but

00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,370
indexing is the power behind the throne

00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,440
and you can change what gets indexed and

00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,940
the way you do that is find out what

01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,970
your users actually say about your

01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:07,070
product what do they actually call it

01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:08,960
use meaningful synonyms for what you

01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,150
think of and what they think of and what

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,930
might be in the middle and add those to

01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:18,230
what you want them to find allow tagging

01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:20,360
but only for trusted users you want to

01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,890
be sure that you do not have bad actors

01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,420
in your tagging system and if you do

01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:26,150
have bad actors you want to be able to

01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:30,530
purge everything they ever did instantly

01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:33,740
because if you do not tie it to a user a

01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:36,620
pseudonym in this user it makes it much

01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:39,260
harder to get rid of bad data and the

01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:41,570
last one is value tag wrangling value

01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,490
the people who organize your data so

01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:46,120
that it's more useful and more findable

01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,120
for everybody

01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:57,260
yes I get into that to that point of the

01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,940
evening where I continue throwing out

01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:02,540
more piece of housekeeping information

01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:04,310
for people if you are flying out

01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,260
tomorrow and you need to store your

01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:09,110
luggage or other stuff that is a bit

01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,550
heavy with you there is a free cloaking

01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:13,700
desk on the ground floor of the

01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:17,930
Convention Center go looking for it i'm

01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:20,900
short somewhere on the maps they're fun

01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:23,980
lightning talk for tonight is by one who

01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:29,480
is going to be caught and Harris oh no

01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:31,100
she's an artist oh okay so are one with

01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,010
assistant who's going to be telling us

01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:36,770
about elegant side pie okay hi everyone

01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:38,750
so we wrote a book with stefan von der

01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:44,540
Vaart who is at berkeley and sadly could

01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:46,580
not be here so the first thing is that

01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:51,560
you can get it for free because I Riley

01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:53,600
had a free book promotion for the syfy

01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,580
conference last July so if you go to

01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,610
that O'Reilly link you can get the book

01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:02,390
for free also it's soon going to be open

01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:05,840
source all of the book materials or the

01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:08,060
book text rather as CC BY and sandy

01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,400
which means don't sell it but otherwise

01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:13,070
you can use it and so you can use it for

01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,670
teaching and so on all of it is written

01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:19,130
in Jupiter notebooks so yeah that makes

01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:22,460
it really easy to fiddle with the code

01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,800
and and see how you do follow us on

01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,950
twitter at elegant Syfy for updates

01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,370
because as i said it's not yet out we've

01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:34,610
been working hard to to get that license

01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:36,740
to pull it out and so will will put

01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:39,080
updates on there and also a recent tweet

01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,370
show where to get the data and the next

01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,380
thing is that we would like you to

01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:45,620
contribute some code because it's still

01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:47,300
in pre-release so if you if you know

01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,100
some cool code that uses the site by

01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:54,200
library we would very much like to

01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:56,600
include it so what's the book about this

01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,999
is our weekly you are advertising the

01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,999
open source project you're not

01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:04,479
mercial book right is that yes yes yes

01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:10,019
yes yes I am yes okay open source go go

01:03:04,479 --> 01:03:14,199
to the to the free things yeah okay so

01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:15,699
this is our epigraph it's from the Rosie

01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:17,289
effect from the Rosie project trilogy

01:03:15,699 --> 01:03:19,899
which you should read if you haven't it

01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:21,759
happens here in Melbourne so unlike the

01:03:19,899 --> 01:03:23,319
stereotypical wedding dress it was to

01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:25,029
use a technical term elegant like a

01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:26,439
computer algorithm that achieves an

01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:28,239
impressive outcome in just a few lines

01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:32,789
of code so that's what the book is about

01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:36,339
is about elegant algorithms using syfy

01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:40,059
so here's for example an algorithm to do

01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:42,429
spectral layout of nodes in a graph so

01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:43,779
that's actually a worm brain all of the

01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:45,099
nodes near the top by the sensory

01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:47,979
neurons all the things that the worm

01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:49,389
uses to sense the world and at the

01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:51,729
bottom you've got the motor neurons

01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:53,289
which is how to wear you know wriggles

01:03:51,729 --> 01:03:55,239
are out and goes find food that it's

01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:57,599
smelling and so on and you can do that

01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:01,539
in a few lines of sci fi I'll point out

01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:04,749
that we're using Python 3.5 I don't

01:04:01,539 --> 01:04:07,199
think people should be ashamed i saw

01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:11,439
someone apologize for using python to

01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:14,829
yesterday just I wanna ask people don't

01:04:11,439 --> 01:04:16,989
start new Python 2 projects python 3 is

01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:19,839
awesome almost all of the libraries the

01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:23,529
big library support Python 3 now and it

01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:25,329
as of 35 it's kind of the only language

01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:27,879
for scientific programming in Python

01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:30,159
because of the matrix multiplication

01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:34,269
operator which makes linear algebra code

01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:36,609
just way way nicer to work with so these

01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:39,039
are some of the chapters in the book and

01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:41,889
we specifically would like some more

01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,229
linear algebra and optimization you know

01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:47,169
function minimization and so on examples

01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:50,949
so if you know that then get in touch

01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:55,389
with us through Twitter and you can also

01:04:50,949 --> 01:04:57,099
go to that lower bitly link and that has

01:04:55,389 --> 01:05:02,099
a github repository where you can submit

01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:02,099
things through github issues thank you

01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:12,960
so the last three cards i have are for

01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:15,430
people who asked to present on Sunday

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,710
I'm going to be lenient and put your

01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:21,940
cards back up on the board because I'm

01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:23,410
nice oh thanks for all of our lightning

01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,630
talk presenters that's been a

01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:28,000
wonderfully wide variety of different

01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,980
topics and really really interesting

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,420
things and really well presented as

01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,830
always the Lightning talks hear of a

01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:35,400
really high standard so thank you for

01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,400
