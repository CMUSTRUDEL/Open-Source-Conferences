Python is generally considered a high level language a long way from hardware, this very fact actually makes it an awesome tool for helping out with the design and creation of hardware!

This talk will hopefully cover;
  * Python hardware description languages (HDLs) for creating "gateware" for FPGA chips or even real IC design.
  * Python scripting for hardware schematic layout and design rule checking.
  * Python tools for deploying, programming and debugging embedded systems.
  * Some cool projects like the HDMI2USB.tv (open source hardware for video capture) which use many of the above parts.

This talk will focus on open source tools.
