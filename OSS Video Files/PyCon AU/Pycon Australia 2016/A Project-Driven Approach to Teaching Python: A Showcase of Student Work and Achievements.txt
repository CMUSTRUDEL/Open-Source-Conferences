One of the greatest advantages the teaching of the Digital Technologies has over most other schooling disciplines is the ease and speed with which students can see the result of their learning. New knowledge and skills go from being concepts they've never seen before to working code and applications very quickly, resources to assist them are everywhere, and feedback throughout the learning process is immediate. This presentation demonstrates some of the work graduating students from my Year 12 class have produced in their final year - projects that demonstrate mastery of computer science concepts like path finding, Bayesian spam filters, Markov chain-based predictive text generators and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. With the right support and guidance, students can go from programming novices to Python ninjas in a time frame as short as two years. Come along and see what high school students are capable of, and how we can help them get there!

all right there we go right welcome back

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,130
to the last formal session for this

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,969
afternoon our first speaker in this

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,139
session is bruce suiter before we do

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,580
actually should i be mentioned now if

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,250
anybody's got any lost property there is

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,170
a lost property seat see the organizers

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,320
at the front front desk they have had a

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,320
few things that have arrived that owners

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,949
okay our first speaker bruce suiter is

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,810
currently the associate principal and

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,759
director of technologies at jungle in

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,230
college in the acct he's a member of the

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,300
advisory group for the development of

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,980
the Australian Curriculum technologies

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,780
during the writing phase he's also

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,840
president of information technology

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,440
educators a CT he was recently named by

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,329
is TE the 2016 Australian ICT educator

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,870
of the year everyone please give her a

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,670
warm welcome to mr. Bruce fruta thanks

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,129
Russell then hopefully audios good and

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,609
everyone can hear me fine so thanks for

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,500
coming along this afternoon you could be

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,180
in another more technical talk I hope

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,650
that what I'm about to show you is going

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,700
to make you rethink the technical

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,640
capabilities of students in high schools

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,680
and I hope that what you get out of it

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,060
is of interest enough that you share it

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,979
with everyone who's missed this talk and

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,570
they catch it online because this is

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,759
really a call to action for the

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,810
developer community and I really want to

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,189
make sure as many people as possible

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,500
hear that so very very briefly a little

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,020
bit more about me I'm a teacher I am

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,850
also a developer and I do a lot of work

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,110
in the curriculum space and was lucky

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,750
enough to be involved in the development

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,290
of the digital technologies curriculum I

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,899
did a talk on Friday specifically on the

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,750
educational context and where I've come

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,659
from in terms of the adoption of Python

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,399
at my school and if you find this talk

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,720
today interesting i suggest that you go

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,670
back and have a look at that the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,979
introduction there really does emphasize

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,560
some of the work that's happening in

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,329
australia around computer science and IT

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,860
education so it's definitely worth a

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,489
look if it's something that you find

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,200
interesting so before I begin talking

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,630
about the student projects I want to

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,820
emphasize just a little bit the

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,900
that's gone into developing the teaching

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,370
program that's allowed this to happen

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,230
and at Gungahlin college we are senior

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,060
secondary only we only see students for

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,500
two years they come to us in year 11

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,150
they come from a number of different

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,240
schools and they've all had very very

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,520
different ite experiences at that point

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,310
so we'll have students who have never

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,460
seen code before and we'll have some who

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,080
may have been writing programs at least

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,300
starting with maybe a visual programming

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,540
language like scratched from about u 3 u

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,640
4 so it's a very very wide spectrum very

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,950
very different capabilities for for the

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,960
students in the group and in your 11 we

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,450
start out by giving students some

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,940
introductory courses on these three main

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,070
sort of themes and streams in the school

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,020
we do some computer science we

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,360
introduced into bullion's the nature of

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,090
logic and the concept of a state machine

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,500
in our programming course we introduced

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,690
into Python and we look at some of the

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,940
language fundamentals and in web design

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,890
the beginnings of design principles or

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,900
for the web and the basic technologies

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,080
that underline that in the second

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,970
semester we move into algorithms and

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,000
data structures we introduce some

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,980
recursion in the programming side of

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
things we introduce them to both object

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,790
iron and event-driven programming

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,840
paradigms and for the students who are

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,270
particularly interested in games

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,910
programming they can start to explore

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,160
the specifics of that and the web

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,960
students are introduced to databases and

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,580
and some introductory Python at that

00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,209
stage if I haven't done the programming

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,790
units then by second first semester year

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,030
12 they're starting to look at things

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,650
such as algorithmic efficiency

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,920
complexity they're modeling complex data

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,120
structures we do some combinatory x in

00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,130
programming was starting to look at the

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,980
use of inheritance in meaningful

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,250
contexts as well as looking at some more

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,930
advanced Python and I say advanced we're

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,320
talking about things such as loose

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,120
comprehensions how to use this sort of

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,100
standard data structures in interesting

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,959
ways functions such as if that kind of

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,840
thing moving it a little bit further on

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,810
from the basics and you can see that in

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,600
web design we introduced the MVC pattern

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,800
and they useful ask as their sort of

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,900
framework for

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,120
web apps and the projects i'm about to

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,889
show you kick in there if you think of

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,810
this as a continuum from the start of

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,180
your 11 through to middle of your 12

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,349
it's actually quite late in that first

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:44,789
semester where these projects begin so

00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:47,430
our first project prophecy prophecy is a

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,509
text generation engine a parody text

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,190
generator and a text prediction engine

00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:57,120
built on Python using markov chains and

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,159
this is what it looks like now i have to

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,159
emphasize these are student projects and

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:03,569
their students who have as I said come

00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,460
from very very little background so

00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,039
they're not necessarily very pretty you

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,620
can see just fires up a little menu you

00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,539
in this case set up or select that you

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,789
want to tell ready generate some text

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:17,250
and it spit something out on the basis

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,719
of the model that's in there now the

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,639
additional menu that I'm going to bring

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,229
up in a second and that will look at

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,270
will actually allow us to display the

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,960
dictionary that's been used to generate

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:31,409
that text what you'll notice is that the

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,169
dictionaries made up of single toward

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:37,319
and free word tuples that are then

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,120
stored and the likelihood of individual

00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,000
words following on from that is all

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,000
already in the text has come from Harry

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,190
Potter novels and Twilight novels at

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,259
this stage turns out is very very easy

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,960
to get those as text files off the web

00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,599
and then this is the text generation

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,969
text prediction engine in action so you

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,610
can see new words are entered the

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,469
highest or the three options with the

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,029
highest frequency are presented because

00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,919
they learn very very quickly that you

00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,690
can't just present the the highest

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,849
frequency each time where you end up in

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,569
a very very small loop very very quickly

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,979
and this just runs infinitely so the

00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,199
idea being that if this was on your

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,419
phone you would use it until you

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,120
finished whatever text it was that you

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,069
would generate so it's pretty cool it

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,599
can you can clear the dictionary at any

00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,520
stage you can read in any texture like

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,949
it's quite literally just text files and

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,930
it will process the text that you feed

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,180
it and store it in a hash table and

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,909
dictionary so this is some of the code

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,550
that the students have written fairly

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,480
simple markov selection function that

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,740
they call

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,510
needed its these are solved problems I

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,650
get that I know that but not for these

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,210
students they're not right these are

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,460
really interesting problems for them and

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,440
this is the parity generator you can see

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,970
the calls the Markov selection method

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,180
are functions they've written before and

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,370
the predictor which on the basis of the

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,940
words that it reads off a terminal two

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,720
persons just written in then makes some

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,970
suggestions so what's really cool about

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,970
this project is that was written in

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,460
three weeks okay three weeks by two

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,870
students one of those students hadn't

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,610
even been programming for 12 months at

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,700
that point it was the first time she'd

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,680
learn programming was about sort of July

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,930
or August of the previous year and she

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,430
wrote this in April May the other

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,780
student hadn't been doing any

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,610
programming for a couple of years and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,050
had never seen Python so the only

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,940
programming experience he had was C

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,400
sharp and the two of them needed to

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,050
manage their project between the two of

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,820
them and so they learnt get on the way

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,700
so that they could do some collaboration

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,740
and when the English teacher of one of

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,600
the students got wind of this he said

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,030
hey when we're doing our post modernist

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,460
literature study why don't you have a

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,560
look at how computer generated text

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,030
could have an impact on how we see

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,060
literature in the future so she actually

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,340
used the parity generator as a means of

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,020
exploring post modernist literature and

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,610
what the implications might be as we see

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,170
more computer generated texts in the

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,430
future so that's pretty cool right the

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,880
next one I'm going to give you a look at

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,960
is pathway pathway is a web-based tool

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:19,830
that allows you to upload a custom user

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,080
map and it then scans the map identifies

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,410
all of the possible and impassable areas

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,300
on the map and uses a star to determine

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,330
how you should get from one point to

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,070
another okay so this is it it's not

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,290
pretty this is just a very quick map

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,690
they threw together you upload it all of

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,630
the orange circles there are possible

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,160
nodes all of the black is impassable you

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,280
enter the two knows that you want to

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,080
search to and bang it finds the most

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,890
efficient path from the start point to

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,830
the end using a star you can change your

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,780
inputs and outputs very very easily the

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,550
one thing that they didn't get a chance

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,640
to implement was a really nice interface

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,770
for identifying exactly where in each of

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,390
the open spaces might be the intended

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,340
destination so that they could name them

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,380
and do things like that so you do have

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,200
to know which nodes you're going to to

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,030
be able to map out the part but this was

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,310
the second iteration of a project they

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,650
began previously where the nodes were

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,330
known so they wanted to move it beyond

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,420
that and actually start looking at how

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,680
you could take a custom map and turn

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,640
that into something that you could then

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,710
run some navigational tools on so as I

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,450
said built on flask this is the ray

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,880
tracing algorithm they used with image

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,340
that was uploaded so all of this was

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,410
written by the students themselves

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,170
usually using some external modules

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,240
which I think was really cool I did not

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,220
tell them which modules to use they

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,870
would come to me with a project often

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,820
I'd never implemented anything like this

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,770
before and I'd say hey yeah let's go

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,570
ahead let's do this right worst thing

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,650
that can happen is you end up with an

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,440
implementation that's incomplete this

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,640
one was a little over four weeks because

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,800
as I said this was the second iteration

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,070
the first one was done on a static map

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,100
now the media local media got got wind

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,870
of this and as a result the guys were

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,580
interviewed and a local business in

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,980
Canberra that actually does indoor

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,570
mapping contacted them brought the two

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,580
guys in had a bit of a chat about the

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,150
work they're done and offered one of

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,920
them an internship so that's pretty cool

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,350
again these are students who had only

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,820
been programming for in this case for

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,530
years a little bit more programming

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,420
behind them but we hadn't actually

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,430
explicitly covered any of this material

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,960
I showed you before we do some

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,700
algorithmic efficiency some basic

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,140
combinatorics but the rest is

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,420
essentially their choice so k some comes

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,330
next a text summarization tool it's

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:50,010
monolingual and it uses tf-idf and

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:51,450
k-means clustering so this student came

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,640
to me with what I thought was a really

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,010
interesting idea and I said yeah sure

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,090
give it a go it wasn't something that

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,380
I'd had a student attempt previously and

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,450
what i'm doing here is just grabbing the

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,460
URL to a wikipedia page for the

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,050
turquoise parrot dropping it in at the

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,180
prompt now this reads

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,519
text entered at the prompt as well as a

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,180
URL so we did have to use URL to get

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,450
this and it extracts the most relevant

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,360
terms or sentences from the article and

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,579
publishes them on the screen so there's

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,209
quite a lot in there and it extracts

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,459
about 8 to 10 sentences in general to

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,980
show that this wasn't sort of a very

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,149
like it works in only very small context

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,920
I just grabbed another page at random

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:38,459
when I was throwing this video together

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,730
last night grab the tiger page and again

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:45,120
a summary quite a few fewer sentences on

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,279
this particular article clearly the the

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,769
cluster the largest cluster was a little

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,740
bit smaller and what I thought was

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:57,089
really cool about this is that the code

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,350
was put together with a couple of

00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,970
different modules that he'd written

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,570
himself that he then imported and made

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,610
use of the k-means clustering was all

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,649
done well he did his own research for it

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,540
and then he imported you've made use of

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,190
a lot of existing Python libraries to do

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,279
a lot of the processing of that data

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,920
which was cool and you can see here he

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,200
also does some of the parsing using

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,149
beautiful soup and I gives you the

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,149
option of opening external URL as well

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,800
as in putting the text manually so this

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,420
student manage to do all of this again

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,310
in about three weeks and that was from

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,160
initial concept to delivery of the

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,589
product the reason he chose to do this

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,360
was because he's ESL English was not his

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,459
primary language and the frustration

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
that he's always had with the articles

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,880
that he's been given by teachers and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,500
that he's had to go to online to find

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,360
additional information there's a lot of

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,459
additional info in there that he just

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,620
doesn't need to understand the concept

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,240
so he figured this was a really great

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,550
tool that would help others like him out

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,589
and as a result of the success that he

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,589
had he's currently working on an app

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,149
that is going to allow visual

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:05,399
translation of text from one language to

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,680
another so he's working with another

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,140
student from the class on that right now

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,940
I'm not quite sure where they're at but

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,740
because i'm not go i'm not teaching that

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
unit at the moment i'm still around the

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
school and i do drop in and out every

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,720
now and again but at the moment they're

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,250
just getting their heads around mobile

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,660
development frameworks so

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,750
I haven't really started on the

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,910
translation but yet this is one of my

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,760
favorites so students said hey I'm gonna

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,040
do some machine learning I want to know

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,110
how neural networks work that's a

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,800
massive ask because nobody knows how

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,510
neural networks work and as a result he

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,450
he decided he was going to start with

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:44,340
handwriting recognition so this

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,490
particular screen when it's read it

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,290
means it's in training mode okay so this

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,230
particular application has already been

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,070
trained on a very very large data set he

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,230
spent quite a lot of time at home

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,900
training it with his own dodgy riding on

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,910
a touchpad on a laptop right so this is

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,610
my attempt at writing pycon on a

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,860
touchpad not particularly great but I

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,140
thought it was alright and what you're

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,550
about to see now is you typing or you

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,680
write what you want you type in the

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,260
intended message it records that pattern

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,510
and it stores that pattern now I didn't

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,400
retrain the data with that because

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,410
retraining takes a very very very long

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,810
time and you don't want to sit here

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,660
staring at dots for ages but when sin

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,010
green mode it will do the UM it will

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,720
actually attempt to recognize the

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,420
letters and you can see here the

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,700
probability scores for each of the

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,230
letters along the top my writings

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,200
rubbish compared to his it really

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:43,380
doesn't line up but if when he

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,450
demonstrated this with his writing and

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,010
the stuff that he'd done what we found

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,610
is that the accuracy rate was pretty

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,740
high letters like 0 and C or a like

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,570
those were all kind of confusing H&N

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,630
would often get confused but as a

00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:01,290
general rule that did a pretty good job

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:04,380
so some of his code this is the training

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,030
code right so he was able to articulate

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,060
to us very very clearly during his

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,130
presentation that basically he wanted to

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,250
take all of the letters that were drawn

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,810
scale them into a 5 by 5 matrix because

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,280
that was about the own that was the

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,400
amount of data his computer could handle

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,710
and then store all of that and use that

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,010
as the basis of doing the comparison all

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,720
right so this is his neural network code

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,140
so you can see there that he's making

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,400
use of numpy to do a lot of the

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,250
conversion and he declares a sigmoid

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,670
there

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,090
so this was a really really ambitious

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,690
task I was really impressed with what he

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,040
managed to do in four weeks and that

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,270
meant learning about neural networks

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,310
from nothing because that was not

00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,400
something that I'd covered in the course

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:54,010
so as a result of this he became the

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,300
expert in the classroom in the expert in

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,220
the school actually is probably the

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,860
expert in all of the camera schools at

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,530
the moment right and as a result when he

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,870
presented this material to a panel that

00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,330
included myself another teacher at the

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,250
school and three university lecturers he

00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,750
was very very confident his presentation

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,690
and was able to address the the

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,550
questions and queries that the panel had

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,770
about aspects of this with was quite a

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,390
lot of confidence and this all started

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,610
because he's interested in machine

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,060
learning and AI in games and in fact

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:29,140
he's been playing around with writing a

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:31,960
game that will have its rules determined

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,940
on the basis of the machine learning

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,380
rather than actually defining the rules

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,700
too early on itself so he's going to

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,050
have some platforms and some things like

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,600
that and you just want to see what's

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,430
going to happen I do I think it's really

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,860
gonna work no will it be an interesting

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,150
problem for him yeah right so I'm not

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,620
going to stop him I think that's really

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:52,780
cool spam away a naive bayesian

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,630
classifier for dealing with spam right

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,220
solve problem but an interesting one for

00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,330
a student who's trying to get their head

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,449
around how this sort of stuff works so

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:06,459
spam away has both a training mode and a

00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,800
classification mode this is the data

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,560
that was received so a classic spam

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,030
email a couple of emails that i sent him

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,530
telling him that assignments are ready

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,600
and that he needs to make sure he signs

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,120
on for work experience so definitely not

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,449
spam very very important stuff and then

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,750
he's other training file which I think

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:28,089
was basically a dump of every spam email

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,840
he'd ever received right so lots and

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:34,210
lots of rubbish rubbish spam this is how

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,220
it works you launch it you point to the

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,110
email which is just the text from the

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,960
email and then it determines whether or

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,280
not it's likely to be spam or not kinds

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,710
of questions who has asked for things

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,540
like how did you do your comparison what

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,120
sort of thresholds did you have

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,150
what amount of data was necessary for

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,550
you to determine the classification and

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,980
through a number of iterations and

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,320
changes to his code he worked out that

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,750
essentially the top three or four words

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,820
the only prints out the top two but the

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,410
top three or four provided the best

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,660
indicator as to whether or not it was

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,270
likely to be spam based on his training

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,400
data right so he was able to tell us

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,870
that quite confidently when he was some

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:20,500
presenting that to us this is the

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,940
training so again or Python he uses

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,010
ultimate spam as the basis of his

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,160
training but then you can chain it with

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,570
additional files that you add this is

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,360
the probability calculation of the

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,280
likelihood of spam and all of that sort

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,130
of just fed very very nicely into this

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,970
very simple application that he built in

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,730
does anyone want to guess yeah three

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,480
weeks now and again no no experience

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,850
with these concepts right so it was it

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,380
was just the need or the desire to learn

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,450
more about AI and that got him into this

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,110
and one of the things that was really

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,540
cool about this one is he challenged the

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,790
guys working on prophecy to write a

00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,120
parody generator that could get past his

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:08,740
naive bayesian spam classifier okay so

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
it was really cool to see that

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,890
collaboration across the two projects

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,260
that was not something that intended to

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,730
happen but it made sense right that's

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,400
kind of one of the reasons that you

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,140
might actually generate text using a

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,430
Markov model to bypass spam filters

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:27,250
right so that was a really really cool

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:29,110
unintentional result of the work this

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,680
one's really cool because it's got some

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,510
really wide but cross-curriculum sort of

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,100
stuff happening in it so in our

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,420
mechatronics class we're launching a

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,570
high-altitude balloon later this year

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,370
and last year students who are in

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,770
mechatronics worked with students in IT

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,720
to launch a rocket they built a little

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,580
circuit and I launched it up in the air

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,440
and they collected data and they

00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,360
basically wanted to see whether or not

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,630
as a prototype that was going to work

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,030
for them so the idea of this simulator

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,260
is you can see that little arrow there

00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,630
that's the balloon and the direct

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,340
it's facing they're collecting or

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,200
displaying all of this information that

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,580
they're going to be able to extract from

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,180
the census that they've already got on

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,370
there and they're trying to determine

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:16,270
what kind of parameters they're going to

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:18,070
need to be able to construct or build

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,990
into the steering mechanisms of the

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,870
balloon to be able to retain the payload

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,460
once the thing launches so it's an

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,840
interesting problem it's applicable to

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,450
the work that they're doing which i

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,950
think is really cool and one of the

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,020
really interesting things about where

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,390
they took this model is that they're not

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,490
only sort of i'll show you the

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,800
configuration file actually this is all

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,990
the information that is configurable in

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,880
the system right so they collect all of

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,740
that but one of the things that they

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,900
want to make sure that they can do is

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,750
that they can take into account the

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,360
various wind conditions in the different

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,280
layers of the atmosphere right so the

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,350
work that they're doing at the moment is

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,450
on integrating that particular model

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,190
into the system so that they can have a

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,570
look at what impact that may have on

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:06,220
getting nothing back so as I said really

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,440
cool in terms of it's sort of cross

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,240
faculty stuff this was four weeks

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,180
including the physics behind it that

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,800
they also had to learn this is a really

00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,720
high visibility project as well the

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,220
local media is really flying with this

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,210
we've been in the paper a couple of

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,850
times and we're getting a lot of

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,980
attention which is fantastic and the

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,790
idea is that the simulation will receive

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,860
the data from the balloon when it's

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,690
actually up there now again very

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,830
ambitious but I like what they're

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:38,050
thinking right so this is the last bit

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,330
and that is why you should care about

00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,580
all of this okay it's really cool that

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,310
these kids are doing it but I see the

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,780
community not just the Python community

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,660
with the developer community in general

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,550
as being a really important part of

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,790
ensuring that these opportunities get

00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,140
extended to other students so what you

00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,060
can do and I think this is the most

00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,950
valuable thing that any of us can do is

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,500
be a positive and active role model

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,050
right and first step of that is to

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,940
provide support not every school has a

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,830
teacher like me with my experience and

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,130
background very few of them actually

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,030
have a lot of IT teachers because of the

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,370
way that the curriculum is

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,350
in structured prior to now and as a

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,540
result the expertise is not there but

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,370
you guys have expertise and one of the

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,750
things you can look at is how you can

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,670
potentially work with schools and

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,990
support teachers and students so that

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,730
you can overcome some of these

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:30,460
shortcomings in terms of that expertise

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:33,640
and skill it would be great to see more

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,290
advocates for computer science and the

00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,280
digital technologies that are really

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,890
vocal and out there in the community

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,840
because the last thing we want is for

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,540
this to sort of be filtered out or

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,910
disappear or for a lot of advocates for

00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,670
it to not say anything and allow other

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,960
advocacy groups to sort of take control

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,060
of what the curriculum might look like

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,500
in each jurisdiction encourage your

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,240
students in any way that you can look

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,580
for outreach opportunities the national

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,800
computer science school is one young Oct

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,110
explorers is another get out there get

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,310
visible and make sure that every time

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,290
you see students doing cool things

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,750
you're giving them the thumbs up because

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,310
they're hearing from real developers

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,260
that what they're doing is meaningful

00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,260
and cool they're going to keep doing it

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,600
one of the things that really

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,740
disappoints me is a high school teacher

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
is that there are often awesome

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,260
opportunities available to first-year

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,430
second-year 30 University students but

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,350
they don't extend to high school

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,170
students no one wants to deal with a 16

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,630
year old on work experience who doesn't

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,360
know anything or these kids are 17 and

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:41,200
it'd be awesome to get them working on

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,750
little projects in various dumb though

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,340
businesses and and development groups

00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,550
and what sort of stuff so it would be

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,580
awesome to see those opportunities

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:55,240
extended to kids in high school and be

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,980
inspirational right if you share your

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,260
successes in the wider community and

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,430
they hear about them and they do

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,250
something about them they're going to be

00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,170
more likely to pick something up and run

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,030
with it and that's something that I

00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,350
think all of us want to do they hear

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,060
about all of the great things that are

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,670
happening with you know automated cars

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,530
and things like that let's get word out

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,620
about all of the projects that we're all

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,360
working on so that's it from me I've got

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,720
a little bit of time for questions thank

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,720
you very much

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,309
thank you very much price if you do have

00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,720
questions just make your way up to the

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,210
mic so we can we can get them out there

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,619
while people work the way here are you

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,789
looking for like people are projects or

00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,379
people to be involved in have you

00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:39,529
considered approaching open source

00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:41,480
projects too could be to contribute open

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,669
source is definitely one avenue that

00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,679
we've talked about the challenge for

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:48,950
students at that point is they're often

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,450
overwhelmed by the co base often it's

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,999
sort of already been put together is

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,679
quite a lot in there not every product

00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:56,299
is very well documented we've heard a

00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,489
little bit about that earlier in

00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:59,749
sessions today so one of the things I

00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:01,970
think that would really help on that

00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:04,549
front is to see some really solid

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,159
documentation and some people in each of

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:08,840
the communities that can be a contact

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,600
person almost for people who are new to

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:16,399
the project so my questions around

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,980
motivation so one of the problems that

00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:23,629
I've run into is like my kids have grown

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:26,059
up with iPads essentially so they're

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:27,889
kind of competing with those kind of

00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:30,169
those kind of projects which have a lot

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:33,710
of time and effort and polish run into

00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:36,590
them so how do you overcome that sort of

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,929
gap between their their expectations and

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,970
what they can you know reasonably

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,080
achieve it's a tricky one we have that

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,759
problem particularly in games

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,220
development where everyone wants to make

00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,470
the next call of duty and there are one

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,690
meant development team one of the things

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,379
that i really emphasize with them is

00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:59,090
that if they can find out what it is

00:25:54,379 --> 00:26:02,090
about that product game thing that they

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:05,119
find compelling to then investigate that

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,580
and if you can somehow help them

00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,980
identify what that is and get them

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,859
thinking about why it is that that's

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,139
compelling then you can start finding

00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:17,179
other examples or projects that they'll

00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:19,879
also find compelling and help them

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,350
identify that thing and at that point

00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:24,049
they start to realize that the polish

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,269
probably may well snice it's it's not

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,859
the primary motivator heat because it's

00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:29,450
very very easy to get caught up on the

00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:31,700
polish and not see what's going on

00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,700
underneath so it's about being really

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,070
explicit about identifying

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,889
aspect and ensuring that they understand

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,090
that's what they need to be looking for

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,399
thanks to talk that was really great to

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,919
see examples of kids doing that sort of

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,389
thing and one of the things I loved was

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,190
seeing the ways that they learnt stuff

00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:49,570
like k-means clustering neural networks

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,289
that sort of thing and so I was curious

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,330
what helped you gave them to get along

00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:58,059
the right track to learn some of those

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:01,320
topics so to find the tools in Python or

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:04,510
whether that was entirely self motivated

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,549
a lot of it with the higher performing

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,990
students is independent for the ones

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,240
that are probably struggling a little

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,070
bit more and need more assistance I call

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,899
on a lot of my developer friends I say

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,610
look kid wants to do this where do I go

00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,019
what should they be looking for so

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,039
that's a really valuable source of

00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:22,990
information for me I think the key is to

00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,490
give them a really solid grounding in

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,169
the fundamentals and it's why we

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,049
invested quite a bit of time in ensuring

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,909
that at all stages of their learning

00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,320
they're doing some computer science

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:33,880
they're looking at some fundamentals and

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,700
there are some guided activities that

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:42,940
really emphasize that hey um you know

00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,679
I'm desperately jealous of you but I'm

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,870
worried I want to know when you have a

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,850
really cool project with a kid kid comes

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,690
and says I have this great idea I want

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,049
to investigate this thing it's

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,639
interesting when people do those kinds

00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,880
of projects they have a high failure

00:27:54,639 --> 00:28:00,850
rate and that's real like doing

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,919
interesting stuff is prone to failure

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,169
and they're young and they're

00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,630
inexperienced and they have a mark

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:11,019
that's associated with it like how do

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,899
you balance risk aversion and an

00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:15,970
interesting bit so one of the things

00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:18,279
that's different in the acct in a man is

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,070
very well aware of this is we don't have

00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:23,950
an external exam so it doesn't actually

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:27,690
matter if they do fail on this because I

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,130
can assess aspects of the process or the

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,440
understanding of what's underlying what

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,840
they're trying to produce as the primary

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,370
mode of assessment in in situation we've

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
got an external exam it's a little bit

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,360
different because you have to make sure

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,649
that they can perform on that so when we

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,450
think about how we're going to assess

00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:45,490
students we really focus on ensuring

00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,790
that what they're being assessed on is

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,640
the communication

00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,990
of ideas their application of concepts

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,820
and the way that they've actually

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,520
thought about how they've constructed

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,230
their project more so than what the

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,150
final outcome can be and that's why

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,400
you'll see that we haven't required them

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,920
spent a lot of time on polish but

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,520
unfortunately not an answer as such

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,470
other than to say advocate for an

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,510
environment that allows you to do more

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,040
of that and less of sitting a

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,600
standardized test where they don't even

00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,950
write code and a force to do everything

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,570
in pseudocode New South Wales all right

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,190
so thank you again very much thank you

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,580
very so everyone please please give move

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,580
