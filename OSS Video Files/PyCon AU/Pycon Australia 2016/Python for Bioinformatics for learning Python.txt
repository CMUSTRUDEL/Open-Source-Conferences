In this talk I will explain why Python is an excellent language for learning about bioinformatics.  I intend to make a compelling case in favour of using Python as a first language for teaching bioinformatics. 

I will then explain how bioinformatics can be a useful vehicle for learning Python.

Finally, we will visit a site where users can learn both Python and bioinformatics in a stimulating, engaging and motivating environment.

The talk will assume familiarity with Python, but does not assume any knowledge of bioinformatics.
