Title: Government dashboards and open data. by Paul Haesler
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Science & Data Miniconf
Description: 
	More and more governments around Australia and the world are starting to talk the talk on Open Data as an essential component of open government.  But to what extent do they walk the walk?  CKAN based data repositories like data.gov.au (at the Australian federal level) provide powerful APIs for searching and discovering published data-sets, but at the end of all that search and discovery, the data-sets themselves sometimes make it clear that somebody somewhere has missed the point.

In developing dashboard applications for state and federal government agencies over the past 6 months, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly not only in terms of API design and data set presentation, but also in terms of commitment to Open Data.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

now I'm not personally familiar with

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,750
Paul and his works I'm have to rely on

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,279
him to introduce himself but I am aware

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,910
of that acronym at the bottom nectar

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,009
they do a lot of lot of amazing things

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,259
so I expect that he'll be able to tell

00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:33,100
us a secret sauce from the bleeding edge

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:35,350
of Australian IT research so without

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:43,059
further ado can we give them a very warm

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:44,769
welcome okay thank you I'm not

00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,899
necessarily on the bleeding edge of

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:49,390
things we have researchers for that I'm

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:54,399
an engineer I get things done and might

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:59,530
make them work so I'm talking today

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,289
about government ash wasn't open data so

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,690
the few governments around Australia at

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,659
the state and federal level starting to

00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,320
take open data seriously and making data

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,970
available in open formats that people

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,170
can consume and do interesting things

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,420
with data.gov that I you is the federal

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,080
government one to seek an instance which

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:28,960
is a secant is a open data repository

00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:31,810
written in python that acts as a index

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,170
to various data sets provides metadata

00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:39,460
on them you can also actually use actors

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:43,330
repository as well there's also a

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,040
national map which is a nickname other

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,540
need to project that I'm not going to

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,490
talk a huge amount about today but if

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,040
you haven't seen it you really should

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:57,280
it's very cool national map gov the day

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,560
you it's a 3d rendered 3d map of the

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,750
world rendered in the browser so it's

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,940
weird runs into this will all written in

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,730
JavaScript running in WebGL in your

00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,569
browser and it can pull down datasets

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:13,690
from anywhere it'll talk to so you can

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:16,780
so any geospatial data still on data.gov

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,660
delay you it can plot on it on a map for

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,660
you so it's very nice

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:27,550
but I'm going to talk today about

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:31,239
dashboards because dashboards are sexy

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,580
this is the cockpit of the space shuttle

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,260
and when people say things like that is

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,190
there's two reactions the other say oh

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,800
my god that's so cool I want to go or

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:49,400
they say ah so much information I can't

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:53,150
code and which ended most be like a bit

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,269
of both actually but which end of that

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,510
spectrum dominates really comes down to

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:02,750
the good design and good user experience

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,390
in a research and practice and nick de

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,000
we've got a really great UX team that's

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:14,599
not me I work on the other side which

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,180
tends to look more like that yeah so

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,780
when you've got a lot of data a lot of

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,000
information coming from all different

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:26,090
places is there's a lot of a lot of

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,650
worrying to keep to keep to keep sane so

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,750
NICTA got involved with dashboards

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,079
firstly with this project for New South

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,440
Wales premier it was a right place right

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,359
time thing one of our business people

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,120
was at a meeting with the new south

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,980
wales premier he comes from a finance

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,930
background with a big on dashboards and

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,519
he was saying I wish I had a dashboard

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,109
with all of New South Wales in one

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,230
screen and I could just see what was

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:58,100
happening and she said we can do that

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:59,269
and then their fourth person what

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,250
happened then was the winter the UX team

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:05,920
I'll mentioned earlier and they prepared

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,920
a lovely mock-up which I'll show you now

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,000
so just to give so this is some of the i

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:18,049
key design features in here point out so

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,750
that they're they're a bunch of widgets

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,460
there they're logically grouped by theme

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,960
so we've got so transport on the far

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,070
left we've got some environment ones

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,659
down the bottom we can expand widgets

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,070
for more information so this air

00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,529
pollution one you can see is being

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,699
pulled

00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:36,809
to give us a bit more information and

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,609
you can provide links back to the

00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,439
original source website if you want a

00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:44,339
bit more information but yeah point is

00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,559
it's all there we've got we've got

00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,229
targets so you can see what the numbers

00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:52,139
supposed to be and you know traffic

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,569
lights to tell you with your aura if

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,189
you're meeting those targets or not so

00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:01,409
that was that was the the mock-up I saw

00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,289
that and said I I know he did build hey

00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:13,919
head back end that for I knew it I was

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:16,079
building it and so from there we we did

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,339
a prototype which i'm like i'm not

00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,939
supposed to show you but i might give a

00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,589
quick peg later on and the final version

00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,639
of that's now up for tender which we're

00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:29,639
hoping we'll get but did i mention the

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,959
dashboards was sexy when people heard

00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,239
that the new south wales premiere had a

00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,529
fly in his soup i'm in a dashboard they

00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:40,499
all wanted one so we've got projects

00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,849
underway for the digital transformation

00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:44,879
office and that'll probably the first

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:46,319
one to go live there's also one working

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,249
for the greater for the greatest Cassini

00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,979
commission that work on at the moment

00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,539
too and we've interest from other state

00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:53,669
governments as well from other new south

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,999
wales government agencies all the new

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:00,659
south wales ministers want one it's it's

00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:03,539
yeah taking off so how do i do the back

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,979
end for something like this hyphen of

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,049
course that's why me talk to you about

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:12,419
it it's it's django based the front end

00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:18,329
is basically pure JavaScript talking to

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:19,619
a an API that served by by Django the

00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,539
maintenance and administrative

00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:25,829
administration user interfaces the raw

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:29,239
built in Django and I've built it using

00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:31,199
a sort of introspective meta data driven

00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,819
philosophy for the data storage and

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,389
processing I'll talk a bit more about

00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:41,149
that as i get into it so there's a quick

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:44,490
architecture diagram we've got a

00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:48,180
database in the middle serving

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:54,120
data out through the API to our um to to

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:57,539
to to the browser's we can you know run

00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,270
the do admin tools admin tasks straight

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:03,810
inside we also have these loader modules

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,020
that speak out to other open data ap is

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:12,449
the government has or sometimes closed

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:16,979
api's to pull the data in and lunge it

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:19,110
down to a single you know metric or a

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,710
couple of metrics in and a detriment of

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:28,889
traffic light and sort the database

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:31,289
ready for the API to serve we wanted to

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,630
support different dashboard views so

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,130
that people could see different sets of

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,340
widgets depending what they are

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,710
interested in so initially we're looking

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,009
at the location whether they wanted sort

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,330
of national data or state data or or

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,919
just Sydney a regional data just a

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,710
deficit near for the greater Sydney

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,520
dashboard we're looking at various sub

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,520
regions of Sydney north south west

00:07:52,520 --> 00:08:00,810
central whatever I talked about having

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,699
different frequency views we haven't

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,889
really done that much with that yet the

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,800
infrastructure is there so might have a

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,180
real-time view might of a monthly view

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,729
answer to show a show data at those

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,009
levels and then you know probably well

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,719
what we're coming calling a few so you

00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,130
know I want to see everything I just

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:22,860
want to see transport data I just wants

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:25,409
the environment data whatever we have

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,020
access control for those so that you can

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:29,789
go maybe some some users so if you some

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,740
users would only be able to see certain

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:36,630
views and some some views would be

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,169
publicly available be available without

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,159
without login so all this is all was all

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,320
in the original design and I've

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,730
implemented it but a lot of these

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,470
features are not really being heavily

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,470
used in the prototypes to date

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,910
widgets so a chose little boxes we saw

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,430
on that diagram is you know it is a

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:04,769
widget what does a widget consists of

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:07,800
from the back end its metadata

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:11,730
description of the widget data so it's

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,370
saying there's a you know which what

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,779
fields we have whether they're you know

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,339
numbers or strings how many decimal

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,690
points you should display whether you

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,910
should put a percentage sign on the end

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,730
all that sort of thing and whether you

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,889
need a traffic light to go with it trend

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:32,060
arrow whatever it is and also some

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:34,620
presentation hints you know what what

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:42,240
template do you want to use to draw this

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:44,870
widget and then so with the way we just

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,610
relate to views as well as I have a

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,750
family of widgets so the overall is that

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,130
there's a family which place this is

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,320
what the title of the which is going to

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,420
be not much more we have a set of

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,660
definitions which is their actual actual

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,810
metadata and then we have a declaration

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,399
so you can declare that that that this

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,949
is my see history coming in as

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,110
definitions declarations difference so

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:09,990
the idea is you can have one widget

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:13,769
might be displayed in multiple views but

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,920
it's the same widget so yeah some say

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,139
yeah some viewers might have the same

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,100
widget other views might have a slightly

00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,810
different widget but they're still

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,970
concepting the same widget but they have

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:35,639
slightly different data in them so that

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:37,170
lets you sort of handle all that so the

00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,949
actual widget data then the actual the

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:44,569
actual data that gets pulled down comes

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,709
down to a set of statistics so each

00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:48,300
individual metric is what I call a

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,000
statistic it's either a number or a

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:57,060
string or a list of numbers or a list of

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,699
strings we can also associate traffic

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,310
light color codes we wither with a

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:03,480
statistic we can have icon libraries I

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,939
think we see to the weather down the

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,369
bottom

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:09,279
a little cloudy thing for the symbol for

00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:12,609
the weather or the sun shining is decide

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,529
this icon library so you say i'm so i'm

00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:17,199
using this icon from this library for

00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,999
this widget today and n trend arrows is

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:22,419
this is this number trending up training

00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:26,169
down holding steady we also support for

00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:30,939
graphs line graphs histograms pie charts

00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:34,059
and various variations on that we also

00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,039
want to start displaying some geospatial

00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,459
data will probably hook international

00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,019
map for that that's again been on the

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:47,289
plan since day one but hasn't actually

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:51,149
happened yet so we've got a few

00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,149
different you few types of widgets as

00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:59,139
yes a digit switch it widget template

00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,269
which is just pop display as a single

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,159
statistic or maybe a single main

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,699
statistic and some secondary statistics

00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:09,999
we have ones that have two two major

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:12,789
statistics we have lists we can arrange

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:14,739
our stats in a grid or a table various

00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:16,899
things when I show some dimensionals

00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:19,329
you'll get a clearer idea of that you're

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:22,239
all sorts of fancy ones now you know tag

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,529
clouds and text templates so you can say

00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:29,259
you know X percentage of this is doing

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:32,289
why and you can update that x and y as

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,569
part of your data feed so i'll just show

00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:36,939
you a couple of examples so on the left

00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:38,619
hand side we've got some two widgets

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,729
from the New South Wales dashboard and

00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:45,549
the right-hand side we've got some

00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:47,649
widgets from the GTI dashboard first

00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,629
thing you notice see that we where where

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,999
I'm tile-based so with with the new

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:54,699
south wales dashboard we just had a each

00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,839
widget was a single tile unless you

00:12:54,699 --> 00:13:01,949
expand them in which case you've got a

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:04,989
expansion tile but but this is actually

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:07,059
got two tiles displaying it once with

00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:10,289
the dto but the interesting thing I mean

00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:13,569
so this this one here and this tile here

00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:15,369
are actually the same from the back end

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:17,439
they're the same they're both a single

00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,830
most acoustic tile the difference is in

00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,170
the front

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,960
to end pretty design guys making it look

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,700
nice similarly here that's a two main

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,270
statistic one what can look like that

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:32,640
back end it's the same just 222 chunks

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,640
of data that time to get displayed out

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,710
so it's a look through the

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,080
implementation I guess the API has only

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,910
a handful of methods first method first

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,060
set of methods was basically asking what

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,250
what views are available to me what what

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,200
can we see so for those three things i

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,660
mentioned location frequency and theme

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,080
there are api methods but just returned

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,820
as simple as that really the user

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,990
displayable label in it and they

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,850
identify to using urls once you've got a

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,820
view you can say what widgets are there

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,430
for that view and we see the full

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,080
definition of each of those widgets and

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:17,770
that's that's just an example the sort

00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:19,990
of thing you see so you know there's the

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,880
the so these these are actually the

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,650
inter describing your duel statistics so

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,340
there's that the label is actually the

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,780
one we saw before with a number of

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,270
financial your tax returns to submitted

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:34,330
to date it's a number we put a

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,680
percentage on the end it's 0 precision

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,830
so there's no decimal point all

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,690
informations there and the third thing I

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,950
and the other thing the other important

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,700
thing that's in that is it tells you how

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:47,890
often to refresh the data for the widget

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,300
so this a refreshing every 60 seconds

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,280
every 60 seconds you'll have to call

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,870
this API the front end needs to call

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,810
this API wishes to get the actual data

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,330
and that is really just a fairly simple

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,030
dump of the data to be to be pumped into

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,170
that into that widget knows how to

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,830
present it because it's already there

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,420
already read the definition so on the

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:11,610
other side we've got to pull all this

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:15,310
data in from all sorts of different

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,920
sources we can either do manual entry

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,900
I've got some nice little Django thing

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,300
that builds some dynamic forms based on

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,070
that metadata so you can enter in the

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,890
exact data you need for that for each

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,410
particular widget by hand that's pretty

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,060
painful people get sick of that pretty

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,779
quick they want to do things quicker

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,399
they want to either

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:38,019
a you know upload upload data in a CSV

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:43,749
or a spreadsheet so I've got these I've

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:45,610
got a framework for upper arm defining a

00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,290
spreadsheet spread it format so you can

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,819
just upload data in that format and

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,920
we'll go straight into your into into

00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:53,110
your widget or we can do have an

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,290
automated load that will get called by

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,410
the ok you get that be called on it on a

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:04,019
schedule and we'll hit some external API

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,019
and pull the data down and process it

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,550
the load of modules just Python code so

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,430
we can do pretty much anything and I've

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,740
done pretty much everything from you

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,370
know pulling down CSV and spreadsheets

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,860
from from secant instances hitting

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:25,089
proper mature AP is the deserving XML or

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,370
JSON or in a worst-case scenario

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:31,889
scraping websites we are not doing that

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:36,850
if we can avoid it for obvious reasons

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:39,250
say issues in obstacles first leaving a

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,740
lack of api's and immature ap is as I

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,240
said and like a budget to do them as all

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,579
year we've got that data and we could

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,009
give it to you but oh how are we going

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:52,389
to get to you we have to write a server

00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:53,860
Oh what after dinner I yeah maybe maybe

00:16:52,389 --> 00:17:00,639
in six months for good build that for

00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:02,410
you Luis adherence to standards several

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,360
times things have broken because I've

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,980
seen characters appear in JSON files

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,289
that aren't supposed to appear in JSON

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,850
files erratically formatted data poor

00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:15,250
data quality I'll talk more about that

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:17,350
in a minute and lack of genuine buy into

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,799
the whole open data philosophy which

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:23,260
I'll talk about in a minute too so here

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,459
are some examples of some of the some of

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:31,570
the data issues of faced a whole bunch

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:35,679
of data sets that are nominally the same

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:37,600
but don't actually match up how many

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,130
mutual a divergent population projection

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,780
sets does new self-government one new

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,460
south wales government maintained for

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,450
planning purposes anyone want to take a

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,289
guess

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,740
I know were free I suspect there might

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:52,840
be more geographic aggregation to

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,940
different levels that's okay it's a pain

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,990
but you know at some at least when they

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,820
would you like to think that be

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,470
consistent about it you know we're

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,620
dealing with local government with LGA's

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,510
local government areas they have numbers

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,820
defined for these things I have ID

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,029
numbers for the LGA's do they use them

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,260
know they'll just use non-standard names

00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:18,970
they'll misspelled names they all right

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:23,500
Sydney City Council in three different

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,360
ways in different files um it's I have

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,850
loaders where the top half of the file

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:33,639
is just mappings saying if I say this

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:36,370
they mean this data published is you

00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:38,139
know a annually in what obviously had

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,929
prepared reports you know spreadsheets

00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:45,820
with a different format every year that

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:48,370
happens accel x dot zip files so zipping

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,779
a zip file for extra compression you

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,850
know xlx SLX sls x is just an xml file

00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,169
in a zip file so there's really not a

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:01,419
lot point in putting out another zip

00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:03,460
file but you know if i do it a lot

00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:05,860
philosophical ones I've actually had

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,659
people say that if we publish the raw

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,019
data people will do things with the data

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,019
we kind of control yeah that's the point

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,380
you know we can't publish that until we

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,220
get the final confirmed figures at the

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,510
end of the financial year no you know

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,649
ninety percent accurate data is better

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,299
than no data um and a reluctance to give

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,399
it to targets oh we don't want the

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,639
traffic like to ever be read you know

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:39,789
it's like oh yeah yeah go orange but no

00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:43,200
not read spreads bad and insistence on

00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:46,659
confusing and opaque metrics we had one

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,250
and probably shouldn't identify the

00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,950
department but we had this great data

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,169
from them when it was essentially event

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,639
spurred per day we knew how many events

00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,910
were happening per day west near me with

00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,860
Vince they're helping per hour

00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,660
and we could we originally were

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,770
reporting that you know number of events

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,270
per hour and they didn't like that it

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,570
become went from a number of events per

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,890
hour to a number of events per day to

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:17,840
total number of events since November

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:19,340
2013 that's really not helpful guys so

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,260
future plans as I said national map

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,600
injured integrations very much on the on

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,850
the on the agenda allowing widgets and

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,880
simple loaders to be created by non

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,950
developer admin staff be great so some

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,690
sort of template stuff so that people

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,730
can roll up their own widgets quickly at

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,620
the moment it's something I really have

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,420
to do or someone with a bit of expertise

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,970
in the system has to do and we'd like a

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,410
more reusable resealable front and the

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,030
back end as I've said is quite flexible

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,130
using the same back end on all these

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,790
projects but the moment has got three

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,830
different front ends we would like to

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:02,660
have a single front end that we can just

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:04,550
risk in and reuse for all of them I'm

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,250
nearly finished I'll just come back to

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,730
that but I'll just um the other thing I

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,950
want to show that my my work with

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:17,690
dashboards goes beyond governments and

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:20,390
open data I am I bravia and this is the

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,800
dashboard in my brewery so and as you

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:28,730
can see the warring really does look

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:30,050
like that I'm not really supposed to

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,270
show you them because they haven't gone

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,290
live yet but if we turn off the cameras

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,060
i can actually show you the live

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,060
dashboards if you would like to see them

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,830
