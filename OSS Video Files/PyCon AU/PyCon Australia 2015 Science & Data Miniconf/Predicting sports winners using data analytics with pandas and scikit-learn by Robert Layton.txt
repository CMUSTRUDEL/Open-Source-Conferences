Title: Predicting sports winners using data analytics with pandas and scikit-learn by Robert Layton
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Science & Data Miniconf
Description: 
	The pandas and scikit-learn packages combine together to produce a powerful toolkit for data analytics. In this talk, we will be using them together to analyse the outcome of NBA games, trying to predict the winner of a match. There is plenty of data out there to allow us to create good predictions â€“ the key is getting it in the right format and building the right model.

In this talk we will go through importing data from the net, cleaning it up, creating new features, and building a predictive model. We then evaluate how well we did, using recent NBA data. The model we use will be a decision tree ensemble called a random forest.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
