Title: A Scientific Game Engine in the Cloud by Oliver Nagy
Publication date: 2015-08-07
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Science & Data Miniconf
Description: 
	Azrael is a game engine for engineers. Unlike traditional engines it emphasises
accurate physics, runs in the Cloud, offers a language agnostic API, and is written in (mostly) Python.

Its main purpose is to make it easy for engineers to build, study, and control
complex physical systems, for instance how to auto pilot a space ship; or a fleet
thereof; in formation; through an Asteroid belt...

I will show a live demo to illustrate the concept. It uses a simple control
algorithm to manoeuvre an object to a pre defined position in space. Once there
it will maintain that position despite random collisions with other objects.

The code is available at https://github.com/olitheolix/azrael.

right I think we might get started so my

00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,050
name is Robert Leighton I'll be chairing

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,910
this session but I won't be doing much

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,579
talking I'll mainly be worrying about

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,119
who the presenters are and who the

00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:31,949
question people are so first up we have

00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,570
a Laverne aching he'll be talking and

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,280
Oliver works in a telecommunication

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,230
startup but I think you're talking about

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,890
something a bit different today we talk

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,489
about scientific simulation as a game

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,549
without the cloud aspect but that's just

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,890
don't break every day yes all right okay

00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:53,710
thank you very much hello everybody my

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,449
name is Oliver Nancy conceived and due

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,199
to the introduction and I've always

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,220
wanted to be a rocket scientist

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,839
unfortunately I didn't become a rocket

00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,699
scientist but it doesn't change the fact

00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:05,920
that I like the things that have rockets

00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:09,430
attached to them so when I see for

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,670
instance then the NASA conduct a mission

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,979
to explore pluton then SpaceX is trying

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,780
to fill the rocket or reusable rocket in

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,090
order to cut the cost of space

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,330
exploration by this one of magnitude

00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,860
then that excitement emitter it can very

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,110
impressive coaching obviously but the

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,570
part that really gets me going here is

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,000
how do all the control algorithms that

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,650
control the systems work that's the

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,159
aspect that I've always been most

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,630
intrigued by and it's not a poor rocket

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,300
science obviously can be everything from

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,830
a self-driving car or and the airport

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,990
baggage handling system it's always a

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,090
very complex system taking all kinds of

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,520
inputs doing some time of more or less

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,470
smart processing and then for using an

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,330
output that hopefully makes your voice

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,030
system behave in a reasonable

00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:58,120
information already the problem with

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,790
that is that in order to learn that in

00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,440
order to gain the skills so they can do

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,770
one of those things like Gilligan

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,750
Rockhead you need but the rock

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,550
and those toys are very expensive

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,229
usually and that's where it becomes

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,580
difficult so if you're in software

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,050
engineering for instance soft

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,730
engineering is relatively is in that

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,860
regard because the barrier to entry in

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,360
software engineering is zero all it is

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,099
the laptop may be an internet connection

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,810
you download the software you're

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,720
interested in which is almost certainly

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,640
free these days and maybe tutorial and

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,110
then you're good to go but if you want

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,629
to do something that it was real

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,629
Hardware especially after like this then

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,519
his story is a bit different also when

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,829
software fails or sec forwards then

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:43,739
that's fine you simply started but if

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:45,120
your rocket explodes so question is how

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,430
do you get there how can you work on

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,260
something like this so my first step is

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,880
probably go to university and you learn

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,250
the basics and that's fine and you end

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,780
up this quickly brought lots so end up

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,269
with something that shows something

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,860
going from 0 to 4 in this case it

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,260
doesn't really matter what it is or how

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,329
it works just this would be here and

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,829
that's fine you have to learn how to

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,040
walk before you learn how to run

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:10,200
obviously and I'm plot this free again

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,989
because it softener so everything is

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,940
good but as quite the staggering

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,650
difference between producing a lot like

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,989
this that show something going to four

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,420
for instance the rocket levitating 24

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,549
meters above the ground and gently

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,739
setting down again or the self-driving

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,560
car increase in the distance to

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,019
pedestrian / 4 meters in principle you

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,670
can relate to that but not quite the

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,549
same thing so it's very underwhelming

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,060
that's what you have and that's what you

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,870
get at university so question Boston

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:46,530
still how can I get bit closer to

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,030
building a rocket and compute again came

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,400
to mind because computer games obviously

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,500
they simulate fairly complex world's

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
very complex environments they have cars

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,109
and spaceships and in a sense they are

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,700
self driving or self-steering and most

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,530
of the cheating of course so because

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,359
those cars and those spaceships they

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,530
follow some predefined paths they're not

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,370
really

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,900
take the laws of physics there are some

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,940
some exceptions but the vast majority of

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,069
games that's not the case and game

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,690
engines are not built so game engines

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,919
are conceptually right to laser set

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,250
because it would have your virtual

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,200
environment but the first and foremost

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,510
purpose of a game engine is to entertain

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,220
so their purpose is to make a rich

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,550
experience to make it visually stunning

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,160
given immersive environment physics is

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,650
important for that obviously but only to

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,050
the point that it does not distract from

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,120
the game it's not having no point in

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,570
having an accurate physics simulation

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,720
because the gamer you would know you can

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:49,320
spend your processing power somewhere so

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,630
good so for the purpose of doing a

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,780
scientific simulation that's kind of not

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,300
cutting and that's where I started to

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,000
think about how could I get around this

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,389
and that's what I came up with work or

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,860
an aspirin so first up as well it is not

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,320
a game engine so I'm going to show a

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,169
live demo hope for him and a few minutes

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,150
and it will look and feel a bit like a

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,650
game but the game engine so if going to

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,220
build the game this is not the tool for

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,440
you the first or the main purpose at

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,630
least for the time being of Azrael is to

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,430
simulate Newtonian physics so to have an

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,350
environment but you can't define objects

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,080
and have the laws of physics act upon

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,400
them most notably how forces and torques

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,900
affect the objects and that's usually a

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,970
point where people come and ask em whom

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,620
is it form or at least that's what

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,650
happened in the past and

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,479
edit an extra bullet point here so it is

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,830
really most of our people who want to

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,990
learn like put a short in the

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,270
introductory video so how would these

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,070
complex systems work how could you build

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,690
one of those OE without having to build

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,919
a complete game or without having to

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,139
build over the simulation environment

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,760
how can you just get cracking on the

00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,220
algorithms that drive this whole thing

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,139
and that's really what it is for so like

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,910
a game if I'd version of the rock and

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,470
that brings me to the live demos and the

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,389
life they know i'm going to show my

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,870
spaceship and not very pretty but it's

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,460
mine and it's free because it's often a

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,340
simple cube it has six thrusters and i'm

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:22,560
going to use that to make it occupy a

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,030
certain position in space and two parts

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,889
to this demo the first manager to show

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,020
you the principal workings of how you

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,389
can you take this engine and the second

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,350
part is giving a bit more of a complete

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:39,120
demo on how that actually allows it to

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:42,000
simulate something more complex so first

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,800
thing up here is them as well in itself

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,389
it is not it's not the module that

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,700
import oh it's not the monolithic

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,789
program that you start is literally a

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,169
small network of micro services so the

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,330
moment it all runs on my local machine

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,070
but all the services communicate

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,620
exclusively by the network so we can

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,870
land it in the cloud and spread up as

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,370
many computers as you want and the

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,710
interaction with as well is the same

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,500
it's purely based on a TCP connections

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,300
or bread viola I are either via HTTP us

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,039
zeromq so it should be possible to

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,760
connect from pretty much any language

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,889
and one of the services that I've added

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,080
in boys FF viewer so it simply web

00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,169
server and it shows a 3d rendering of

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,610
the scene in your browser at the moment

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:28,440
there's nothing in the simulation that's

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:32,630
why you see nothing and the first demo

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,630
is left I'm going to show very quick

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,210
PCBs for pike on brisbane by the way

00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,939
so the basic directions is for so you

00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:55,159
usually instantiate the client that

00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:57,259
connects as well and then you can issue

00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,819
certain commands those commands you have

00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,959
to always pass a couple of arguments but

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,389
I'm not going to bore you with those

00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,339
arguments to a rep decline into yet

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,349
another client especially for this

00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,179
presentation so we don't let / the

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,599
arguments but the principle is east exit

00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:13,849
like that so you create a client and

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,689
make it connect to system so that

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:19,459
happened here then you have to have

00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,019
define an object like the spaceship that

00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,789
I saw I'm not going to do that I have

00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:24,229
already done that before hand but once

00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,979
you have that available you can simply

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:30,499
spawn and you get your whatever it is so

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:33,050
that's a simple cube but the geometry

00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:35,749
really arbitrary so you can upload its

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,629
complex and object as you want and of

00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:40,399
course you get the standard some

00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:44,979
standard modification commands that you

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,979
can scale it if you want or you can

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,580
change the position or you can also

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,580
modify

00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,019
the geometries themselves so in this

00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,929
case of a simple command that perhaps

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:17,099
the modifications did those three pun

00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:26,459
the pep you ah ah the console you mean

00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:27,689
ah ok I'm sorry for that one ok but

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,549
that's really over time it's just a

00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:32,069
couple of predefined for my commands in

00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,929
at Cindy cordset scale set position and

00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:35,909
said post a flame in this case just to

00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:37,409
change the visual appearance in this

00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,689
case gives a visual fatigue of each

00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:42,509
thrust as I active let's peel officials

00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:48,389
and those rosters actually active let's

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:52,589
remove this money again and actually

00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,999
turn on the thrusters so another service

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,799
that is running has been running where

00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:58,379
the time already is a rigid body in

00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,629
physics engine that would pick up all

00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:02,429
the objects in the scene and compute or

00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,549
progress them according to the laws of

00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:07,799
physics and the forces that act on them

00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:09,720
and in this case I simply apply force to

00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,269
the thruster that points to the right in

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,470
this case so now check slowly but surely

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:19,709
will start to drift and now on the other

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,720
side and slowly virtually come to a

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,599
standstill so that's really the basic

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,689
commands didn't need to already build

00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:29,689
fairly complex demo

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,720
I've used exactly the commands that I've

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,850
just shown you to create this one so it

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,189
spawns to object and simply it changes

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,779
the scale every hundred milliseconds

00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,610
every 10 seconds it change it randomly

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,920
changes the position so these are simply

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,230
Marcus in space and we'll use as targets

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,449
those targets could be for instance in

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,910
the rocket rocket shoot levitate the

00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:03,420
particular height or very automatic car

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:07,499
should move itself to or whatever your

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:13,759
your application demands and of course

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:16,970
to make this here useful that's enough

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,970
looks like

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,930
of course that just pick them home I can

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,519
hear it so that was the spaceship that I

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,319
had before with executive commands that

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,910
I had before and it randomly picked one

00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:42,339
of those two tires and is now following

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,870
this time so not like in a computer game

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,269
where they will be scripted this year

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,310
really uses a simple control algorithm

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,230
in this case to activate his penis

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,079
doesn't move it's not very smart

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,689
algorithm is talking but just to give

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,730
you an idea we can now build your cubes

00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:00,069
and figure out whether you have a better

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,199
way or a smart hour faster or efficient

00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,480
way to move the cube around and of

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,339
course it can plate it not just with one

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,389
cube but it came played it with many

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,850
cubes as you want because as you have

00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,829
noticed already that this one here is an

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,240
telling a separate terminal and this one

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,649
down here was another terminal so

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,120
they're independent processes so they

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,769
don't have to run on the same machine

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,209
you could have the individual

00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,980
controllers really running on your own

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,930
dedicated computer if your controller

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,050
for instance is very complicated and

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:34,329
does require a lot of power but not for

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:36,540
this one here see if my shelf will any

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,540
good

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,189
is there no very good and that's my typo

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,899
I would do we'll be good to go in the

00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,899
right environment

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:19,610
now in the wrong directory some slow

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,470
you're getting there oh yeah so now

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,709
there are another five of those so six

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,199
in total they all have picked randomly

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:29,990
covering eight targets now obviously

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,550
they are trying to own one the two

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,199
groups are trying to occupy the same

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,809
position in space which may or may not

00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,339
be desired so couple of caps go to the

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,559
same location it will be good if they go

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,420
to a similar location but not quite the

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,009
same one and the other problem that you

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,160
see is those boobs in text with each

00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:47,899
other so if you have one car going to

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,209
one destination then I got another

00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:52,309
destination then this is very fun to

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,050
watch on the screen and reminds me very

00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,439
much of growing up with siblings to be

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,420
honest but it is not this kind of stuff

00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:01,610
that you want to see in yourself

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,949
dragonkind know if it bumps around like

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,439
in an article that's probably not the

00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:08,959
desired outcome and it turns out now to

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:11,240
build the system that makes those cube

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,980
to those Tigers without touching each

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,019
other that's ready a considerably harder

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,329
problem in terms of simulating it with

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:18,740
as well it's the trivial extensions as

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,499
if we spawned a couple of more cubes

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,299
exactly the same program as I showed you

00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:25,639
but now you have to be considerably

00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,049
smarter with the island so if you want

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,879
to go down the route of doing something

00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:32,420
is done in control theory that's one

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,189
option or maybe you want to go and use

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,589
something from artificial intelligence

00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:39,589
or use your machine learning or deep

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:41,449
learning like the liked a slice trialing

00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,980
with their cars at the moment you can

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,540
really put anything that you want in

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,339
there because as well is taking care of

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,809
the simulation you just connect to it by

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,730
the network and you can use whatever

00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:52,939
tool and as a matter of fact or whatever

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,089
language you want to query that system

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:57,649
and make an extra point you can make it

00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,480
more and more realistic so for instance

00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,160
instead of just clearing the system for

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,439
the position of the other cubes in order

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,600
to avoid them you could just clear their

00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:07,100
position and render that into an image

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,410
like they do here so pretend that they

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,259
have a camera on the object

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,509
and if you do that then you can you say

00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,579
image processing to figure out via image

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:18,470
processing where those objects are how

00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,779
they are moving and used as an input

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,360
which is probably lot more realistic so

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,850
you can gradually layout it up further

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,750
make rain gradually layer to make the

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:32,449
simulation more more complicated and all

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,100
the while you can focus mostly on the

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:36,620
underlying I wouldn't switch in the part

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,480
I enjoy doing most the display ways is

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,120
the last demo I have not written

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,829
anything yet that X in any smarter way

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,199
but I hope is whether these give you a

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:46,519
bit of an idea what I'm trying to do

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,980
with it and what it's supposed to be

00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,839
doing as well itself is still it's an

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,670
infancy but it's usable two degree

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,670
leases I hope you can see here

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,440
and it's actually also ready at the end

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:07,760
of my talk so thank you much for

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:11,860
attention if you have any less to 10

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,360
more seconds so documentation is there

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:22,209
again the red is not very readable I

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:24,769
thought it would be better this time so

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,510
that will be yeah if you like it for

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,540
whatever reason I should point out so no

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,709
one is paying me to do it so yes I sorry

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,320
I didn't get the name it's very real

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,019
rocket yeah so it's robert pointed out

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,730
so it's not what I'm doing for oh it's

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,889
not hard money so it's all in my spare

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,750
time so if you liked it for whatever

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,100
reason and think it's cool for whatever

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,600
reason our please consider giving me a

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,360
star github since it's pretty much the

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,949
only currency here for this one I would

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
very much appreciate it yeah if you

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,459
don't like it don't give a stuff but if

00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:08,290
you do maybe you can people thank you

00:16:52,459 --> 00:17:08,290
very much ok any questions yeah button

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:18,679
how how uh how did you build that

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:21,140
in there ah dead ship I went to a guy

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:26,360
who know how to use blender and he built

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:29,179
me the chief oh because I am do you and

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,260
do and do you use code to make it work

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,700
here um yes sir that's all cause

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,530
everything that he solved beyond the

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,970
graphic that's or work or than Doug with

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:45,440
new stuff yes yeah thank you very much

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:46,610
um so that was like very interesting one

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,320
of the things that I'm kind of

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,120
interested in is the idea of like an

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,220
autonomous robot or research into

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,049
autonomous vehicles so to what extent

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,820
can you sort of like dive into one of

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,559
those objects and get an object I view

00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,360
of the world like put a camera or a

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,790
sensor on it and see the world through

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,890
the object Elizabeth that's tribute at

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,540
the moment what I do is I stand in a

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,940
fixed position of space and when they're

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,559
seen from there I'm to nor did we really

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,330
need to create a position for the object

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,250
anyway so all you have to do is instead

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,280
of theory that instead of running from

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:20,419
them standing right now your vendor from

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,070
where the object is so the trivial in

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,200
principle a trivial extension yeah if

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,690
you know JavaScript yeah but my my

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,309
javascript is not that good am but the

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,510
rendering is there is very easy so we

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,860
could already have to define is your

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,549
position in space and then you see it

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,780
from there so I shouldn't why not you

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,340
saw it so I could actually move around

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,549
through the scenes that if it was there

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,110
was a live steam yeah oh yeah that's

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,290
really interesting and so you mentioned

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,870
that you're got different parts of the

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,870
whole package communicating over TCP

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:54,830
have you tested it on any sort of cloud

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:57,230
environment I mean no not yet there's a

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,480
demo running on cloud on the cloud right

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,669
now but not over multiple computers are

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,600
still on the same computer so I have not

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:05,970
done any perform is tweaking anything

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,559
so cause the original levels when I

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,020
started it was very preoccupied with

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:13,080
case of your low latency what not there

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,429
and I never got anywhere so on yeah time

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,220
around that I started I first make it

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:19,289
work and then make it fast but it turns

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,860
out it works surprisingly well so even

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:25,620
though the web browser is very time so

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,919
it does if Hamas the server as fast as

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,840
you can to get new updates and 4 i'm in

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,350
melbourne and hitting up hitting on any

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,990
instance in in sydney and AWS I get very

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,260
smooth animation for Iran I think 20

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,260
objects at a time Iran in the scene

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,260
thanks

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:52,400
you said it he said it was a Newtonian

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,750
physics simulator what elements of

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,810
Newtonian physics have you seen my life

00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:01,790
like how do you set mass or thrust or

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,280
few lies any like to what extent do they

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,780
exact extent that bullet does it I'm not

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,160
I have not read my own one because

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,900
there's no shortage of physics engines

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,510
out them so i'm using the bullet engine

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,090
simply reptillus item and incorporated

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,430
at them so everything that the almost

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:22,850
latest version of bullet does this one

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:26,870
can do is well any further questions one

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:31,610
more I'm just wondering what's what's

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:34,820
the theoretical max threads that you can

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,860
run through it so I doesn't run any

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,480
threats at all so that is there's a

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,250
database that serves as the collective

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,840
memory yeah or the other service is

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,910
there purely stateless communicating by

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:49,520
the database basically whatever the

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:51,960
database can cope with works yeah cool

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,240
I've got a question where do you see the

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,100
next six to 12 months of this project

00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:03,060
going question it depends and it bends

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,610
an RPM in the job that pays me so it's

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:09,830
lately have been very busy I am hoping

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:11,610
to make a few more performance

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,620
improvements and have a proper

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,590
simulation running on on the cloud

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,160
distributed so that's pretty much higher

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,250
on my my listing in Trello and the on

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,060
there I would like to have a few more

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,830
something that's a bit more punch in

00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,360
terms of demo because the graphics is

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,440
very simplistic and it's possible to get

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,510
your fingers the object and things

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,340
they're lightly in with them not the

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,220
JavaScript guy now for me it was a pain

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,780
in the bum to actually 10 one so i put

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,250
it off for as long as I could so that's

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,850
probably bit more in terms of foolish

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,770
and beyond that I personally simply

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,570
likes you to experience bit more with

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,480
the algorithms but probably also they

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,080
have a few more physics components in

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,080
detective mode you

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,850
great all right thank you thank you very

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,850
much

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,590
