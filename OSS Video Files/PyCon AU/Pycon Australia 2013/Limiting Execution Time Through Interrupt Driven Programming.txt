This talk explores the challenges of ensuring responsiveness of applications under varying conditions like suddenly increased load, code regressions and problematic user data that reveal code paths with unusually high time complexity.

I'll be looking at interrupt-driven techniques to help bring the 95 percentile of the response times of your application closer to the (usually much lower) mean.

In this talk, we'll go beyond tr
