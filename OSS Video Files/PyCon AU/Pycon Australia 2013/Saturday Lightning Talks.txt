	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,600
so we have our lightning talks which is

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,180
our traditional closing plenary for each

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,940
day at PyCon Australia before we begin

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,700
I'd like to welcome a representative

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,429
from the Australian Computer Society

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,310
Tasmanian branch who are our platinum

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,710
sponsors for this year once again

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,529
they've been a huge friend to grassroots

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,529
computing in computing organizations

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,010
within Tasmania and we're very proud to

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,900
have the ACS involved with PyCon

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,199
Australia in Hobart for the second year

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,880
running

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,540
so could you please welcome Robbie

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:45,270
Burton who is the branch chair for ACS

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:47,760
in Tasmania thanks Chris

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm gonna be very very brief which I'm

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,210
sure you'll all think before because

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,360
you're here to listen to lightning talks

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,890
and not to me drone on the ACS is really

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,250
excited to be involved with PyCon again

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,840
this year we were very keen to find out

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,510
about it when Chris came knocking last

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,129
year and chatted to us about it and we

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,799
were really excited when we actually got

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,299
to participate in that event and really

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,400
impressed with how was run so when they

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,070
came up that it was back here again this

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,500
year it was a no-brainer for us we

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,860
wanted to be involved from my

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,720
perspective PyCon is everything that an

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,119
ICT event should be it is engaged and it

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,619
has a great outreach program it has

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,850
great rules to make sure that everyone's

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,860
treated fairly and equally and that

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,840
everyone can be involved and has a great

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,780
passionate community that really seems

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,670
to be welcoming so for me I really want

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,930
to also put out a thanks to Chris and

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,369
all the other organizers behind the

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,439
scenes who are putting on a really good

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,810
event once again and setting the

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,850
extremely high bar for whoever's

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,229
organising next year so I'd like to

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,829
actually ask for a round of applause for

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,829
the organizers

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,140
the Australian Computer Society hasn't

00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,970
always been heavily involved in

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,200
communities such as open source

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:09,610
communities including PyCon we have

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,280
always had lots of members we've got

00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,630
over 20,000 members australia-wide and

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,040
we've always had lots of members

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,250
involved in these communities but the

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,470
organization itself has at times been a

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,750
little bit remiss in that fact something

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,630
that we're trying to change we've been

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,480
around since 1966 which is a long time

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,890
in ICT and that brings challenges it

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,050
makes it very hard for us to stay

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,430
dynamic and to keep up to date and it

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,200
can make it difficult for us to be

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,450
involved in all the areas that are

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,940
really driving ICT forward and it's a

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,530
challenge we're trying to tackle that's

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,440
where we hope that we can get support

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,420
from communities such as PyCon and the

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,920
Python programming community to help us

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,370
stay relevant and to help us keep

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,730
delivering values of the ICT community I

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,140
won't try and pretend that we're

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,490
expecting to get lots and lots of

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,320
members out of this event that's not why

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,209
we're involved in these events we're

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,300
involved in events like PyCon because

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,570
these events really help drive the

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,550
community to keep ICT moving forward and

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,410
whatever benefits the ICT community

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,340
benefits our members so that's why we're

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,560
here and that's what we're all about so

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,150
what I would like to just highlight is

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,800
some of the things that we do do and if

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,750
any of it interests you but the most

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,850
important part about the ACS is that our

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,830
members are the ones who actually drive

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,690
things so if you get involved and you

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,090
have a chance to actually have influence

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,860
over what we do but we do offer

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,000
professional development and quite an

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,010
extensive amount of professional

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,720
development to our members we offer

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,820
internationally recognized certification

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,820
that are it's recognised in pretty much

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,519
every developed nation in the planet we

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,620
are operated Vaca see at the state and

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,690
federal level and you may have noticed

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,310
that the federal government's cloud

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,769
strategy that they're finally getting

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,930
around to doing is actually being led by

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,160
the Australian Computer Society so we're

00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,720
heavily involved in that type of

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,880
environment if you're interested in

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,230
making a difference there we operate a

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,650
number of specialized communities of

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:09,170
interest we do curriculum development

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,330
and any of you have an ICT degree from

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,830
raelia or studying that degree was

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,270
certified by the Australian Computer

00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,910
Society because we work with every

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,680
University in Australia to do that and

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,150
we do things like offer our members

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,799
professional indemnity insurance which

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,300
is included in your main bishop fees and

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,370
so forth

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,990
so if any of that does interest you and

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,460
you're not a member I highly recommend

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,020
either contacting the test branch if

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,780
you're Tasmanian if you're interstate

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,580
have a chat to those your local branch

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm not gonna promise that you're

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,790
necessarily going to talk to them and

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,770
find out that that's exactly what's

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,840
going to add value to your life if it's

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,020
not all I ask is that you let them know

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,610
why because as a society we need to stay

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,229
relevant and we're really keen to hear

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,770
from people especially the people who

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,060
don't think that we are relevant so I'm

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,250
going to leave it at that

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,900
I hope you all have a great conference I

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,070
hope that these lightning talks are

00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,360
inspiring for you I've been looking

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,430
forward to it because I missed out last

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,030
year on the lightning talks and I hand

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,030
back over to Chris

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,960
so lightning talks you're probably

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,370
familiar with how these run or some of

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,470
you may be some of you may not be I'll

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,659
run through them talks go for five

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,039
minutes you can sign up on you've signed

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,210
up on the white boards outside there'll

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,800
be another session of these tomorrow

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,690
where you can sign up for those probably

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,759
from tomorrow morning onwards you have

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,460
five minutes to present on any topic

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,960
that you like we strictly enforce this

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,970
time limit

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,129
today our stopwatch is actually being

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,310
provided by Moore's cloud and you can

00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:41,349
see it on the table in front of me I'm

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,930
just gonna start a countdown now on it

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:49,240
and you'll see it starts green and from

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,150
two minutes onwards it fades down to

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,629
yellow and from 30 seconds onwards it

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,280
will start blinking so hopefully that

00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,810
will be a nice easy way for you to spot

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,900
when you're running out of time for the

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,330
speakers so we have 11 lightning talks

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,039
today who have signed up first will be

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,440
from Simon Mears and that will be

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,750
followed by Frank Sainsbury so Frank if

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,039
you could come up and set up here our AV

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:19,330
people will come and make sure things

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:29,729
are going for you I'm so over here Frank

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:29,729
this side so Simon your time starts now

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,409
okay come on you hear me okay so this

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,050
isn't necessarily a plug for anything

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:43,270
it's just me trying to be helpful you

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,949
can take it or leave it we are I assume

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,889
for the most part programmers who have

00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:52,830
relatively sedentary jobs unless your

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:55,210
desk looks like this or like this and

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,509
I've been working on a formula for

00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,279
calculating weight loss and just general

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,610
fitness you can digest that for a little

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,349
bit little bit complicated but the

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,509
trickiest part about the formula is the

00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,340
two input parameters at the top nothing

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,110
at least for me and most of us probably

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,520
have no idea what those two parameters

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,250
are the calculation itself is quite

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,560
simple there is also of course balancing

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,310
out the types of foods that you eat as

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,980
well and knowing how much you should put

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,110
in

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,090
and how much your body is actually

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,940
burning each day as well and until

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,130
recently I had absolutely no idea there

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,470
is a website called eat this much calm

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,030
which is a helpful little tool you can

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,530
plug in a few stats there and it will

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,970
tell you how many calories you should be

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,780
consuming in a day which so that gives

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,660
you one of the parameters and the other

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,340
parameter you can calculate by putting

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,960
Foods in you can add custom foods and I

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,940
can see there that BLT would cost me

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,110
three hundred and seven calories out of

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,890
the two thousand or whatever I'm

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,530
supposed to eat in a day you can't

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,020
manage what you don't actually measure

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:04,480
so measurement how many people have

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:08,960
heard of autocracy forty thirty percent

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,760
it is largely inspired for gamers who

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,650
are addicted to things and we've seen a

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,950
lot of people turn their addiction to

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,660
gaming into an addiction for fitness I

00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,100
actually found it thanks to Randall

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,770
Munroe

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,110
a few of you may have seen that before

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,500
it's also been on Penny Arcade the idea

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,970
is that you log exercise that helps you

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,010
to keep a record that's the measuring

00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,419
part and gives you points for of course

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,190
you can game the system completely

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,440
that's not the point you're supposed to

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,979
be keeping yourself accountable and

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,690
encouraging others to do so as well

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,240
there are groups so it's bit of a social

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,860
network with a fitness bias you can have

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,750
challenges within your groups there are

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,310
quests if you're a gamer or I just

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,220
wanted to learn to do something new

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,040
there are achieving and it tracks your

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,720
progress it integrates with RunKeeper

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,320
this is a run that a group of us did

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,260
this morning around Hobart it manages

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,990
your records you can keep track of all

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,760
your stats up the top and everything you

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,490
can watch yourself make progress this is

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,140
real stats which are very cool you can

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,460
watch your weight go down that was me

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,590
over the first three months having

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,830
joined it is Jenga powered which I can

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,830
proof

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,550
so just a tool doesn't work for everyone

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,020
try it out see if it works for you but I

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:44,040
encourage you to use something even if

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:50,340
not that is that you done that's it

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:53,010
well thanks Simon okay so our next

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,450
speaker is Frank Sainsbury followed by

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,230
Tim ensel Tim if you could go up to the

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,470
old podium and Frank your time starts

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,470
now

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,450
I'm attached mining I've been put up to

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,620
this by Paris Paris Buffalo gentlemen

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,690
the front row with the camera taking

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,420
pictures he has given me a set of slides

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,420
interestingly enough he hasn't let me

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,630
out you look at them so let's find out

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,190
on a journey together what do we do I

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,530
need your help

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,550
that's obvious 8as as long as one of you

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:30,540
is a psychoanalyst hands up he's not

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:33,270
there ah my faith in other pictures I've

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:38,210
no idea that it's someone told me that

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,210
Rick Ross rick roll from well it's Chris

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,400
blow me

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,690
I know so the goal colonization of Mars

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,360
well I have been working on this project

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,640
I'll be spraying it up in the shed and

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,270
it's nearly ready but I think you'll

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,900
make masks it has a fundamental flaw

00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:00,380
which is has got propellers oh come on

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:05,360
too many flippin and what are you got it

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,360
which one we got come on give me them

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,830
it's a big button

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:19,440
take the glasses off jump to the next

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,440
boy

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,950
someone showed Frank how to advance the

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,320
slides okay I'll do that one ha ha the

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,390
goal colonization of Mars version one

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,560
prototype ah they've seen and I've

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:38,950
explained it didn't work

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:43,570
version 2 we touch me to Mars isn't by

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:46,390
some means how Jean and pike are now

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,960
whiskey whiskey who's got my whiskey

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,120
give it back on and mummy I'm very good

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,690
at providing money to out-of-work IT

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,910
people or unemployable self-employed or

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,920
whatever they call themselves this way

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,500
they're very very good at providing an

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,120
opportunity to get rid of lose cash so

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,250
the number of people in the community

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:13,480
who need lose cash you know who they are

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:16,480
give them money see I do I'm worth it

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,220
all sure homework and on the on the plus

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,660
side what I should do is spend a few

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,210
seconds trying to persuade you that

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,280
sometimes are not crazy and I have a

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,710
have something of a heart I'm involved

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,020
in compassion compassion Australia I'm a

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,190
compassion advocate too small to ignore

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,720
I went to see this guy where Stefan

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,610
international compassion spike he was

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,130
talking he'll songs in Sydney about 6 or

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,430
7 years ago and he I came to his talk he

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,890
made me cry 5 times that's pretty rough

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,200
ok I can go to his talk now I've got an

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,200
animal system went to his next talk made

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,500
me cry five times more you should read

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,260
this this talks about what we do to the

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,740
smallest and the least in our societies

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,970
across the world they are the people who

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,530
died under-fives died in sub-saharan

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,220
Africa at a rate that would make your

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,320
eyes bust any hit get a heart think

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,780
about it I don't care which one of the

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,460
very many sponsorship things you do

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,860
compassionate is a very Christian

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,570
organization right now its sponsors

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,340
through churches they give people Bibles

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,260
you expect to rights and respect to pray

00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,470
to them praying for them

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,050
okay you that's one way of doing it I

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,690
don't care if you think that's all

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,340
pie-in-the-sky don't want to do it but

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,070
you've got to get your money out of your

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:40,210
pocket and give it to people who need it

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:44,560
people who for whom that $2 a day turns

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:46,480
into doubling of their income who takes

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,880
a whole village and changes its

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,370
lifestyle one of the stories he told me

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,080
that made me cry was he went to an

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:57,790
African village he lived there for a

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,470
long time when he was six three-quarters

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,350
of the boys in the village who were six

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,500
died from malaria he didn't even get

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,480
sick he asked his father why and because

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,430
of course being a white boy he'd been

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,010
inoculated with something that made him

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,820
immune to catching malaria in that

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,530
particular strain fact and some other

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,280
things which were revealed in this

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:23,470
lovely book too small to ignore there's

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,510
one of the things that fired him up to

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,850
the age I don't know how it is now 70

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,660
probably still working as a CEO of a

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:33,820
major major organization driven to

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,200
change the world I'd like to think that

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,630
we all want to change the world I

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,810
certainly do I would like you to get

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,020
your hands in your pockets and take out

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,400
the money and sponsor through some

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,760
organization as I said I don't care

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,860
which one find it in your hearts to

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,230
spend that a little bit extra and then

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,390
when we come around to the next century

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:03,790
which I always see but my son right then

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:06,540
3 2 1 unreleased thank you so what

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,540
you're saying Frank

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,540
Frank it's not that it's not that

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,500
they're worth that you're worth it is

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,140
that they're worth it yes thanks Frank

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:24,370
up next we have Tim followed by Dylan

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,370
Jay and Tim your time starts now

00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,380
can people hear me now so I was

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,940
originally going to do 10 projects in

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,740
five minutes but I decided that's crazy

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,290
so it's five projects in five minutes

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,000
which is probably still very crazy first

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,850
project I'm talking about is Python take

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,150
time TZ if you're using date and times

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,130
you should be using UTC if you're using

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,110
dates and times in Python you should be

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,110
using date/time TC it's a drop-in

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,410
replacement for date/time that actually

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,510
does time zones it cares deeply about

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,610
time zones it figures out your local

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:07,190
time zone in like a bazillion different

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:11,240
ways and it like works I'm kind of a bit

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:13,610
biased because I wrote it but it's

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,790
definitely worth using it has a bunch of

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,190
other things like it supports passing

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:22,510
through the date you tool library it

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,650
uses PYT see I didn't reimplemented

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,290
supports going to and from UNIX

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,530
timestamps unlike the original date time

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,690
library which seems to hate unix time

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,880
stands for some reason that's where you

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,720
get it it's on the thing please help me

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,000
make it everybody use it because date

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,450
times are hard and time zones are harder

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,460
so please use that I recommend that you

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,320
also take a look at ipython notebook

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,080
great tool for writing python quickly

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,050
especially if you're a noob which I am

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,000
most of the time it looks kind of like

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,660
this you get lots of graphical cool

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,860
stuff pretty awesome if you're more of a

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,870
command line junkie

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,880
I recommend B Python it's basically a

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:11,720
graphical command line console it takes

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,810
ipython and like add steroids so you get

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,880
like online help and tab-completion and

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,709
all those type of things

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,360
so now I'm going to ask you to help me I

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,880
have a bunch of unfinish

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,720
ideas I'm be at the sprints I would like

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,179
your help to make them finished ideas

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,000
first ones cooked in videos it's a

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:35,210
platform for videoing conferences like

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,860
this and streaming them onto the web as

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,350
you can see it's made up of a bunch of

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,980
different projects I'd like your help

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,360
with all of them the GST switch and the

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,649
streaming system of both python-based

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,659
the websites Python and Django based so

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:53,179
I need your help that's where you can

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:56,720
find the code I'm not a Django

00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:59,090
programmer I have like barely used it so

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,909
I would really like your help making it

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:05,539
awesome rather than looking like it was

00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:07,039
coded by a five-year-old the other thing

00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:08,899
I'd like your help with a thing called

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,659
Tunes finance you might notice a naming

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:18,110
scheme here so original Tim last last

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:20,179
year I forget your name sorry came up

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,269
and gave a presentation about slimming

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:24,470
scraping his bank details before that I

00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:28,279
read had the same idea

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,740
turns out fools think alike it's Django

00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,269
based it turns out banks are stupid and

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,010
don't give you like unique ideas for

00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,659
transactions they give you a file which

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,929
has some type of description or maybe a

00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:40,370
date if you're lucky those things will

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,919
change so I wrote a base class which

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,440
deals with all those stupid things all

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,330
you have to do is write a little

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,130
selenium program to give it CSVs and

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,139
then it imports into database I don't

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,450
have a front end it's all Django based I

00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:55,070
need help with front-end stuff he does

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,769
things like regex based and

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,049
categorization it does things that banks

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,610
hate like doing fee matching so you can

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,980
figure out where your fees are going

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,510
it supports transfers because I'm not an

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,630
accountant and think if I move money

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,580
around it doesn't make any difference it

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,440
supports multiple currencies country

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,200
extraction tries to do anything

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,049
everything I would really like help I

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,620
ever had time to work on it that's where

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:23,539
you get the Connaught form I seem to

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,570
have managed to get through the five

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,779
projects so here's a bonus project

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,590
zookeeper

00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:32,779
it's what runs the conference website it

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,670
also runs flights conflate you website

00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:36,040
it's

00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,950
the source project I highly recommend

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,930
you help out I'd really love to see the

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,050
mobile UI that's been floating around

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,110
merged into zookeeper and a whole bunch

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:50,380
of other things it's I don't actually

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,050
know what this uses but I highly

00:19:50,380 --> 00:20:04,450
recommend you hack on it at the sprints

00:19:53,050 --> 00:20:07,330
and I'm over okay so up next we have

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,010
Dylan J followed by Nick Farrell Nick if

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,700
you could go to the other podium and

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:15,970
make sure things are set up doing your

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,250
time starts now so just before I start

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,470
I've been asked by my friends at in

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,490
Japan to give a plug for PyCon APEC so

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,070
how many people have been to Japan

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,780
before if you haven't been to Japan it

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,330
I've been a lot around Asia it is one of

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,420
the most awesomely different weird

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,930
amazing places so if you want a Python

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:42,880
holiday with the difference a pack its

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:44,680
the clothes of the clothes fought for

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,540
the closing date was 9th of July so

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:50,230
you've got to get it in quick for your

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:53,230
arm to give a presentation so what I

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,740
want to talk about was robot framework

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:59,740
how many people heard a robot framework

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,960
not very many good excellent so we were

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,450
asked recently by the New South Wales

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,550
government to develop a application in

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,760
order to register all pools in New South

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:12,400
Wales so how many people our own a pool

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,260
in New South Wales you should have used

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
this application to register your pool

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,880
excellent so we have this point we had

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,470
to fix it we had to test sorry the

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,800
application we were building to make

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,660
sure that it worked and we wanted it was

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,570
going to involve JavaScript e we use

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,760
lands property information widget in

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,890
order to work out addresses and stuff so

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,660
it had to work with JavaScript so we

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,200
needed a different testing framework

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,330
than we normally do so once just kind of

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,790
loads up you'll see it actually run

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,500
through there's a lot of testing

00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,180
frameworks there's we were using test

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,570
browser before but there's web tests

00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,570
there's

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:59,510
there you go it's running blah blah

00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:03,010
functional web testing is not fast but

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:06,260
anyway I'm just gonna leave that running

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:12,650
this is interactively looking up you

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:15,380
know the addresses and so on so so what

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,620
do we need another test framework you've

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,370
got lots of them already you got all

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:26,390
these behavior driven development stuff

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:30,530
it's gonna get it mine you've got some

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:34,340
simple functional test-driven ones so do

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,990
we need another one the fit one other

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,830
was talk all here earlier this is quite

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:43,070
similar but I think better actually has

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:48,350
a history it's not new it was developed

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:50,059
by it was developed by Nokia was first

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,870
released and open sourced actually in

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:57,169
2008 and it has this keyword driven

00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:01,400
development approach so it looks a

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:10,390
little bit like this so you have a text

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:10,390
file yeah there is a hitless version

00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,440
there's two ways to run it by the way

00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:21,269
there's a there's the natural the

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,739
inbuilt robot framework runner so you

00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,479
don't but I'm using something called

00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:27,029
robot suite which integrates it into

00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:28,349
your normal unit testing framework so

00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:31,259
you can use layers and everything like

00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:33,059
that it's a little bit new and it

00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:36,109
doesn't really like ctrl C that much

00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:41,190
because it runs subprocesses

00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:44,309
so so it's a functional web press it

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,049
uses selenium underneath so you get all

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:50,700
the selenium keywords all the power of

00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:52,349
selenium without having to touch java so

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,580
test javascript which is what we wanted

00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:58,229
but it's also written in python the

00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,729
plain communion just switch recently

00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,649
switched all there are functional web

00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:04,349
testing to using robot framework so i

00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,879
thought good idea to have a look but

00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:07,979
it's actually a generic testing

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:10,769
framework Oh generic functional testing

00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,539
framework it has this concept of

00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:14,220
libraries so you can hook in all sorts

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,580
of different libraries to test you know

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,220
things like you know desktop apps and

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,889
you can we use the XML RPC library to do

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,529
certain to get certain information about

00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:28,799
now objects and stuff there's a telnet

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:32,070
library this process libraries XML is

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,769
etc so it has this idea of a text file

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,470
and you can see the test cases is kind

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,989
of designed to be reasonably easy to

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:46,830
read you have a bunch of these different

00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:48,539
test cases so keywords the real idea of

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,190
keywords is to try and hide the details

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:53,700
you want to kind of modular wise you

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,179
test my aim personally is to try and

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,269
have tests I can give to clients they

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:03,619
take arguments there's these different

00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:08,899
ways of it supports the Gherkin syntax

00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:08,899
and robot suite works with layers and

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:22,900
that's more information on a revocation

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:26,060
thank you very much Dylan okay so um

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:28,700
Nick Farrell's machine was kind of sort

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,260
of not working so our next speaker mic

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,250
Zhu Hearst if you could set up do you

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,540
have some slides awesome mic so just

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,070
give you a moment to set up on that

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,080
podium over there Ryan will help you and

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:46,330
just put on your thumbs for a few

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:49,460
minutes while the a/v gets set up and

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:55,900
over on the right hand side could we

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,900
have Josh to pray yes that one

00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,290
so it looks like josh Despres is ready

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,710
to go so you just let me get the on

00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,610
scene Emily you are on so Josh your time

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,890
starts now

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:31,170
Oh colored stop it he only has five

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,880
minutes I I didn't expect such a

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,730
response straight off the bat okay so

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,200
I'm the other Josh and I'm this is a

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,510
lightning talk about code Wars which

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,280
hopefully might have you went last night

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,380
it was the second code was I was

00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,290
responsible for arranging and so I

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,870
thought I'd better get up and talk about

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:52,049
so a long long time ago that man over

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,549
there Chris basically we have a chat any

00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,190
asked if I could organize a code Wars I

00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,830
don't really understand why he did this

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,850
especially considering how to arranged I

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:04,830
am but Yolo so tip number zero I have is

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,590
if you want to start a war start by

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,630
getting shanghaied by Chris okay

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,669
so at that point I was clear to start

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,809
code Wars and obviously when you're in

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:13,820
Viking on a new endeavor it's very

00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,410
important to do basic research

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,090
especially things like code Wars anyone

00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,730
who's done higher research like a

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,309
masters or PhD will agree that the most

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,580
important part of research is Wikipedia

00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:28,530
Wikipedia is full of fun facts such as

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,059
the existence of the cod Wars so this

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:34,020
this was an actual just an actual

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:35,850
fishing territory dispute between the

00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,350
Iceland in the UK and this is

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,940
demonstrates this first thing that I am

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,910
developed about code Wars and that is

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,250
always offends the enemy with lame jokes

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,490
and bad puns the whole way as often as

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:50,720
possible the enemy is the audience so a

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:53,010
code was is a competition for coders and

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,919
it's fought and won with code that means

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,809
the puzzles have to be interesting and

00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,760
challenging to programmers so first of

00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:02,220
all what appeals to programmers such as

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,950
these types nostalgia

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,360
okay so apply a nostalgia to maximum

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,940
effects programmers and software

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,860
engineers love ancient code and legacy

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,840
systems and wading through poor

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,090
documentation and anti patterns of what

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,950
they do all day so and if they do it all

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:21,660
day they must enjoy it a lot see so do

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,270
it the second thing is programmers also

00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,100
love mystery

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,900
to adequately fill up the 20 minutes per

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,580
problem you have to give them as many

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,760
possible directions to investigate and

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,590
no hard clues about where to go to solve

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,390
the problem this is also a direct

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,240
parallel to their day jobs which they

00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:40,640
must certainly enjoy many modern

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,010
developers love stylish abrupt font

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,140
changes colorful background imagery and

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,930
text and animation such as you can

00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,460
obtain with a marquee tag or gifs so

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,300
cheap effects give you a lot of bang for

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,490
your buck

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,880
and finally developers love working with

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,650
text provide lots of text it doesn't

00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,270
matter what the text is something

00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,860
totally irrelevant and even utterly

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,500
offensive to logic and reason is

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,910
perfectly acceptable so that's what

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,350
appeals to programmers now I shall

00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,350
describe how to build problems that

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,900
challenge them each puzzle should take

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,730
roughly 20 minutes to solve filters that

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,320
come to PyCon tend to be fairly talented

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,720
so you trip them up with basic

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,940
techniques such as the Spanish

00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,770
Inquisition methods you pick a method

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,780
that nobody expects because it's too

00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,820
obvious encode the secret in the most

00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,830
basic way you can imagine a cheap

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,090
variation on this is to choose a

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,700
container file format that is

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,500
interesting from a Python perspective

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,270
such as one that has four library

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,040
support and then you halfway into the

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,680
competition reveal a software product

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,410
that does better the competitors will

00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,000
love you for doing this or better yet

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,090
take a library they should be familiar

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,700
with like numpy or slide play and then

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,020
hide the data using one-liner but don't

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,710
forget to check that you can decode it

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,670
later on one last thing though

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,920
programmers simply love questioning

00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:00,890
their own opinions and their values so

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,990
what you should do is using a current

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,520
event as inspiration make them spend

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,560
effort on the side they are likely to

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,360
ethically disagree with such as building

00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,200
deliberate security vulnerabilities or

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:16,540
privacy violations into an app and with

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,540
that my talk is over thank you

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,899
thank you very much Josh um and to

00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:28,260
everyone else I am so so sorry

00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:31,200
so Mike Joo has do I see somebody's a

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,539
machine working over there Ryan is that

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,110
are we getting are we getting a new

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,799
machine whoa

00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,269
okay so my G horse is up next and

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,870
followed by Peter Lovett on this machine

00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:45,110
over here so uh Mike your time starts

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,110
now

00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:09,960
are there any venture capitalists in the

00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:12,720
room any MBAs okay all projects require

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,690
investment whether it's a small project

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,429
and just a little bit of time and effort

00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:22,950
or a large project that requires a

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:29,130
serious investment so who invests

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:31,409
without a business plan on account of

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:35,059
the no venture capitalists in the room

00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,059
I'm quite comfortable saying this I

00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:41,130
needed to start a project a couple of

00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:44,159
years ago and I went around to the

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:52,230
venture capitalists and that's exactly

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:55,919
what they said which is a bit which was

00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:02,789
a bit sad for me but I decided I'd go

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:05,639
away and and put together turn the

00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:08,940
prototype into a product and find some

00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,740
customers and generate a revenue flow in

00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,690
order to do that and they did revenue

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:20,659
but I didn't have any so what I did was

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:23,370
write a framework for recruiting

00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:26,959
resources and putting a team together

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:32,779
and I put it up on

00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:37,529
github it's a sweat equity framework

00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:38,849
which I enjoyed doing and I don't know

00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:43,969
whether this is going to work if we've

00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,969
you might have to switch off your your

00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:50,659
Wi-Fi devices

00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:05,470
are we getting there aha the equity

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:09,080
agreement is the the key to all this

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:11,929
it's it's probably not worth looking out

00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,600
here if you're interested that's the

00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,460
address but essentially what it says is

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,310
that you have to have an equity plan and

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:24,159
you have to be able to convert time and

00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:27,620
effort into equity and the key to it is

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,880
eventually you're going to get a venture

00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:34,040
capitalist involved and at that point

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,860
the sweat that's been turned into equity

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,159
can either be left there or converted

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:42,409
into cash at the same rate that the the

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,360
venture capitalists invest in and if you

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,899
keep it in there the equity agreement

00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:50,000
says you can continue to hold it and

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:54,110
every month you get an opportunity to

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,240
trade it in-house and the price of that

00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,570
equity to be traded in-house will be at

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,730
the most recent external investment or

00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,600
whatever anybody cares to pay for it if

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:09,970
it's above that so that's essentially it

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:13,880
the other guidelines I leave to your

00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:17,890
perusal and they suit me possibly

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,890
they'll set you thank you

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,080
thank you Mike so up next we have Peter

00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,180
love it and he will be followed by

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,500
Samantha Connolly so Samantha if you

00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,520
could go to that lectern there that

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,770
would be fantastic

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:39,560
and Peter your time starts hang on

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:42,460
I'm gonna leave you hanging here oh he's

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,700
doing an interesting dance very mystic

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:49,220
suspense is very now pursuing the

00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,930
certification of Python it is a well

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,150
known and off demonstrate fact that a

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,820
person whose work is incomprehensible is

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,280
held in high esteem as it says in the

00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,720
inter cal reference manual what I'm

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,730
gonna be doing is showing you what to do

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:07,460
by showing you what not to do now guido

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,590
tries to stop us I found a way around it

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,460
if you do from future import braces you

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:17,230
get syntax error not a chance but it's

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,970
not quite true you can use braces on ifs

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:24,610
if I is greater than 3 print hello world

00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,610
semicolon sort of print goodbye

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,090
you can use it on loops while true print

00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,860
hello well

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:41,100
semicolon sort of goodbye you can indent

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:44,730
however the heck you like this is all

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:48,240
valid Python works a treat you can put

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,930
the braces wherever you like if it's

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,910
indented by one space a couple of small

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,980
problems I've come across like the order

00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:01,590
as well and you have to do an even

00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,480
number of steps doesn't matter you can

00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,810
use semicolons they've worked in Python

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,130
since like ever if you're going to make

00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,920
it look like so you might as well wrap

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:18,240
your tests in parens you can even use

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:19,800
pre increment unfortunately I hit a

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,230
couple of snags on that one doesn't work

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,170
quite as well as I'd like and postfix is

00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:29,270
broken now this one's nice you can even

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,270
use C++ style comments

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,270
bonus point if you can tell me what J is

00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:45,240
it's not too even that says - is the

00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:47,100
answer even better go twos go - is not

00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,170
always considered harmful found the

00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:56,040
lovely little module called go - this is

00:37:52,170 --> 00:38:01,610
true valid Python so you can do loops

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:04,080
without doing loops we're that Vigo - a

00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,670
couple of apologies apologies depend a

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,070
topologist prep several apologies to

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,470
pierce f polities to be do GPR and

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:14,090
apologies to any same programmer ever

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:16,740
and with the disk limit this was a joke

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,590
this is not intended I don't want to see

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,080
this sort of code out there and in

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,000
specially in memory for of Dennis

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,520
Ritchie who died something like a week

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,480
after Steven jobs and yet in my and any

00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:34,380
technical person's opinion was far more

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,060
important to the level of of technology

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,070
that we actually have today the creator

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,740
of the C programming language I've still

00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:44,630
got some time so bonus point what's the

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:51,210
furnace prize what's the value of Jay

00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:53,580
who said false very good I still got

00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,940
some more time man bonus surprise anyone

00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:03,930
tell me about inter cow and what it was

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:06,000
famous for come from that wasn't what I

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,080
heard it here come from thank you very

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,700
much inter Cal was a joke language that

00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,960
instead of having a go to has a come

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,290
from and that Indus the lesson thank you

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,290
very much

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,030
so I was gonna have you ejected from the

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,070
conference for causing severe of offense

00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:32,850
to everybody in this room Peter but

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:35,490
thank you for the bribe so up next we

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:40,710
have Samantha Connelly followed by

00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:42,840
Nathan Fagin so Samantha your time

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,780
starts now

00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,060
so how do we promote IT is Python the

00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,810
answer I can't give you that answer but

00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:54,450
I can at least give you some ideas so

00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:56,430
there is an issue apparently even though

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,550
we've had amazing turnout today we've

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,040
had record-breaking numbers come to this

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,190
conference this weekend there's still

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,770
less than those people studying IT past

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,869
grade 10 or wanting to study technology

00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:14,910
or anything like that there is a survey

00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:17,400
the ACS have done it it says so but

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,460
there are everyone uses technology all

00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,440
these young people have phones every or

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,240
they have the internet at home or there

00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,740
they're always on social media or

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,359
they're always doing something with

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,480
technology but they don't necessarily

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,830
want to learn or want to get into it how

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,720
can we address this issue so in my

00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,460
opinion and I'll just state that again

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,000
it's my personal opinion don't take it

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,190
as fact or what not teachers may be

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,170
misinformed about careers in technology

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,540
they may not know how to promote it this

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,540
is another good thing with the ACS is

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,180
what as well I know personally the TAS

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:56,609
Beck is actually trying looking into

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,700
engaging high school teachers in this

00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:00,840
area in how to promote technology so

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,609
maybe that's a step in the right

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,609
direction but there's also

00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:09,050
misconceptions about IT profession it

00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:12,180
seems a bit mundane maybe it's boring

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:15,450
how can we overcome those misconceptions

00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,510
out there there are for example TV

00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:21,869
series which promote geekdom as quite

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,830
introverted nerdy people I don't need to

00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:27,300
say what type of TV series but and also

00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,460
someone was telling me that they a

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,609
student came up with this quote but oh I

00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,309
don't want to sit in front of

00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:35,349
computer all day and I will ask them

00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:36,819
this question what type of person

00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:40,450
doesn't sit in front of their computer

00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:42,249
later on in their career so I think we

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,789
all diverged towards sitting in front of

00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:48,160
computers eventually so technology is

00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:50,470
fun we wouldn't be here if it wasn't or

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,059
engaging and Python's meant to be fun

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:58,200
right that's what everyone says so you

00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:00,579
may be familiar with this comic

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,930
apparently he can fly with Python I

00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:08,410
guess you can do whatever you like with

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:10,539
Python so in my experiences and I i have

00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:13,119
promoted Engineering and Technology

00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:15,640
through Robo gilts by running robotics

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,289
workshops with young people and that

00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,970
they really engaged with that robots are

00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:21,220
cool and sexy I think they're a fun way

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,890
of promoting engineering and technology

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,200
to young kids and I also have my own

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,450
radio show called Robo radio so if there

00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,069
are any locals who would like to come on

00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,470
and talk about technology feel free to

00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:35,829
contact me I'm always looking for more

00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:39,519
people to come on but that's also helped

00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:41,499
me be able to talk to people and I think

00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,809
that's what we we need to do as an

00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:47,109
industry is just talk to people about

00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:50,019
our ideas and our technology and what we

00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:51,400
can do so because I've run robotics

00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:53,769
workshops I would actually like to see

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,559
if I can run raspberry-pi workshops with

00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:59,410
Python see if I can engage children or

00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,849
young people with Python as a language

00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:05,710
how can I teach other people who are non

00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:09,009
programmers about Python it's meant to

00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:11,440
be fun right so anyone can do it so I'd

00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:14,950
also I know there's a java operating

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,249
system for Lego Mindstorm as well and I

00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:21,009
like to say that that's quite fun

00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:22,599
is there a version of I know there is an

00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:25,630
old version of Python for Lego

00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,309
Mindstorms but I'd like to see maybe an

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,980
updated version which has just as much

00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:33,309
support as Legos which is the Lego Java

00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,319
operating system I'd also like to

00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:37,509
explore our dream a robotics in Python

00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:40,150
maybe there are some interconnections

00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:42,630
there that I'm unaware of how I can

00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,750
promote this more

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,910
so also maybe some other side notes I

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,890
could potentially run building a basic

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:56,220
app for Android with with young people

00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:57,930
that might engage them somewhat and also

00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,849
graphical programming is quite fun I

00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,039
enjoy promoting engineering and

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:04,200
technology to kids using a Lego

00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,299
Mindstorm software it's all graphical

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,720
and I've got these yeah I'm tutoring

00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:11,339
these year for year for kids and they're

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,529
adamant they know how to program because

00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:16,019
they can use this NXT software I mean

00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:19,740
like sure it might be a misconception

00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:23,819
whoops wrong error and I have a

00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,109
conclusion I don't have answers but we

00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,519
need to have these conversations with

00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:29,569
people in our community to get the word

00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,569
out there about technology

00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:43,299
Thank You Samantha so up next we have

00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:43,839
Nathan and I think we have one more

00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:47,170
after that

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,960
excellent okay so Nathan your time

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,960
starts now

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,020
all right there's been a lot of talk

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,540
about ipython notebooks so I thought I'd

00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,290
share a link to the ipython

00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,700
NBD viewer which I'm not affiliated in

00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,520
any way with I just think is really

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,349
awesome basically it's like an online

00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,390
tool that people use to share their

00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:13,180
notebooks so if you have a github

00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,220
account and you've committed your

00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,589
notebooks to your public github account

00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,079
you can share them with and be viewer

00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:21,460
it's basically it that's all I wanted to

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,329
say so now I'm going to show you some

00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:28,329
examples essentially the way it works is

00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:31,299
you cut and paste the URL of your

00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:37,530
notebook file which can either be a gist

00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:40,420
or a a public get link raw link and

00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:43,569
people have been doing that to share all

00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:48,460
sorts of interesting things such as you

00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:51,309
know how to draw xkcd plots there's a

00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,829
gallery of interesting notebooks where

00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:56,740
people have been communicating basically

00:45:53,829 --> 00:46:00,309
what they've been doing in areas such as

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,740
scientific computing social science

00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:04,329
there's a whole lot of tutorials there's

00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,470
some interesting stuff about social data

00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:09,430
I think it was a talk earlier today

00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:11,740
about that stuff you know people are

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:13,809
doing great stuff it's pretty neat

00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,579
the advantage of stuff like in be

00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:18,160
viewers that you can download notebooks

00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,920
so once you download a notebook you can

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,369
load it into your public I'm in your

00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,650
local notebook viewer and then run them

00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:30,040
and you own the code so that's a really

00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:32,319
good way of sharing things what if we go

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:37,119
here people plots people plots are cool

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:39,970
people are doing people plots xkcd plots

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,920
so but the idea is that this is just a

00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,849
really open way of communicating your

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,790
write your ideas the guts of it is if

00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:50,890
you have a github account which I have

00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:54,039
and you've put your ipython no

00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:56,920
Folgers sort of like a JSON file up

00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:59,589
there you can get to the raw URL link

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,440
once you get to the raw URL link you

00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:04,660
basically cut and paste that URL into

00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,799
the ipython notebook viewer and you

00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:11,920
click go it's probably not going to work

00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:14,589
but it will and it does so you can

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,720
basically generate and these these links

00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:19,529
that then you can send to people they

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,970
can introspect your you notebook files

00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:25,990
so this is all being dynamically

00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:30,720
rendered and that's it that's my

00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,720
lightning talk guys use notebook girl

00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:41,109
thank you very much Nathan and I

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:43,930
understand that Nik Farrell has fixed

00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:45,640
his laptop and is now ready to go so

00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,609
your time starts now

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,349
hello everyone I was briefly talking at

00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:55,809
lunch to a couple of people and I

00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:58,420
believe it is I switched it on it's on

00:47:55,809 --> 00:48:00,130
so now I'm talking hello I was talking

00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,839
to a couple of people at lunch time and

00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,630
I realized that some people here don't

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,819
understand super and mro and a couple of

00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:11,410
things like that so while some of you

00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:14,410
this will be old hat others may benefit

00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:16,240
so I'm just brought up with a little bi

00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,680
session here with a couple of sample

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,380
scripts I threw together just to give

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,849
you a quick introduction into what super

00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,769
is what mro is and a little bit on

00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:25,269
mix-ins

00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:29,250
so basically as you can see there's a

00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:34,180
beta class here doing something basic

00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:36,519
the simplest pattern using super is you

00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,519
subclass this class this is Python 3 so

00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,950
you don't need object here within the

00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,319
class you can use super to invoke the

00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:47,650
original method or any other method on

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,559
your parent class and do whatever you

00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:52,390
want manipulate the result okay on the

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,579
right I've just pre baked what the

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,609
output is so you can see what it's doing

00:48:54,579 --> 00:49:01,000
without writing anything that's the

00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:02,349
basics that's all super does now as you

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,690
can see I've invoked mro

00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:07,720
on the classes this well

00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:10,690
attribute provides a list an ordered or

00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,390
tuple of the classes which will be

00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,099
inspected to find an attribute when you

00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,380
try to get it particularly for calling a

00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:20,560
method so in this case you can see the

00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,720
do stuff will first look in the do stuff

00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,420
method declared in main otherwise we'll

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,589
fall back on the generic object and

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,450
simply when our subclass it just means

00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:34,060
it looks in the other place first that's

00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:36,550
pretty basic now first of all I'm

00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:39,730
showing you the next iteration here I've

00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:42,430
created a logging mix in so this is

00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:45,700
still specific to foo but the intention

00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:48,040
is that somehow or other you want to

00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,359
combine the two you want to have this

00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,369
derived class

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:54,420
do your foo behavior but you want to use

00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:58,390
this nice mix in which is at the moment

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:01,660
not very agnostic to do some print

00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:06,490
statements around it so quick poll which

00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:09,369
one's right if I wanted to first look

00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,079
first try the logging mix in and then

00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:14,020
it's super should be the do stuff which

00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:17,200
one goes first is to stuff to correct

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:20,800
errors do stuff one correct hands up if

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,069
you think do stuff one is correct as

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,310
IFIF you think this stuff two is correct

00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:28,869
well one is correct so you were more of

00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:32,710
your right than wrong though most of you

00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:34,930
didn't know so okay so the right the

00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:39,220
right thing like I say there here's one

00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:42,250
so just means you read what I said okay

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:44,589
jumping along I'll move across so that

00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:47,980
was the output of the previous this is

00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:50,260
the enhanced version this is it could be

00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,609
done better but this is showing how you

00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,220
could make a mix in which is more

00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:56,109
agnostic in this case I don't care what

00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,910
method you call on the base class I'm

00:50:56,109 --> 00:51:02,020
going to intercept it using get

00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:04,540
attribute I can print some info about it

00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,670
then I'll call the real method pass back

00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,290
the result in this case I also log the

00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,440
result before I come back to the parent

00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:14,470
if I could use func tools wraps etc to

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,840
make this look a bit nicer but it's not

00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,030
this is about

00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,670
this is just an example of how you can

00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,920
harness the advantage of making a mix in

00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:24,570
drop it in

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,000
just a brief tasters to the introduction

00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:31,010
to it that's all there is hopefully some

00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,010
of you have benefit from this thank you

00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:42,930
and that is the last of our lightning

00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:44,550
talks for this evening so firstly thank

00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,780
all of our lightning talk presenters I

00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,780
think they're all been pretty damn good

00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,630
