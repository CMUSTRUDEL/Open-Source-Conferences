Is Django a CMS? Is Plone a Framework? For years I've seen developers stumble over the same problem, when should I use a CMS like Plone, Drupal or Wordpress, and when should I use a framework like Django? Covering real case studies of projects gone horribly wrong through the use of the wrong technology. The audience will be left with several solid rules to follow to guide their future development.

okay how many people attended my talk on

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,070
Friday at the Django conference okay

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,480
please don't attend this talk this is

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,010
because I'm gonna pretty much be

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,260
covering the same ground so you're gonna

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,970
see a lot of same slides it was a

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,380
two-for-one deal they asked me to do the

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,260
Django thing and I said as long as I can

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,609
kind of make them similar so we've got

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,199
the big gay adventure over that way

00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,640
which you know these are my pictures not

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,500
theirs and this is scientific

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,950
visualization I think simulation so do

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,350
attend this talk if you want to know

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,260
when to use a CMS and when not to use a

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,579
CMS when to use a framework and a little

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,090
bit at the end about how to combine both

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:56,100
so I want to apologize in advance

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,660
because last night I drank a couple of

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,670
these on top of all the rest of it so

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,340
I've got a massive hangover or I did

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,129
this morning so if this isn't done as

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,990
well as it could be I'm blaming the the

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,939
Tasmanian long island iced tea so this

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:17,630
is me this is what I look like when I'm

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:21,740
presenting it's a lot like this so a

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:25,530
little bit of history about me I'm a

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,210
plain core contributor that was for the

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,740
Django slide but it's still true I've

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,759
never written a line of Django I have

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,189
done pyramid and I've also been around

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,680
the box with regard to sort of web

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,130
development and and and development in

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680
general I used to be a Java developer

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,649
which is not written there like a lot of

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,649
people build a lot of websites with my

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,119
company since then the other thing I

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,619
want to talk about is that I kind of

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,549
lied a little bit I said I was gonna

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,229
have a showdown it's less you're not

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,700
gonna see a scorecard there's not gonna

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,290
be a winner there's not gonna be like

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,619
blood on the floor or anything like that

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,229
what I really want to talk about is how

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,660
many people hear a framework kind of

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,230
people like a Django

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,970
pyramid something like that sorta how

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,200
many people were CMS kind of people

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,000
would consider themselves building

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,260
websites using CMS okay so hopefully

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,910
what I'm gonna leave you with is an

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,550
understanding of what the difference is

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,840
because I think a lot of people can get

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,900
quite confused and end up doing the the

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,760
wrong using the wrong tool for the wrong

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,650
job so a little bit about you know what

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,500
frameworks are out there instead of

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:50,420
where the influences come from we had

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,220
some just open this right up one of the

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,160
first frameworks

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,750
I think twisted counselors framework I

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,510
haven't got that on there but done zope

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,800
is one of the first big popular Python

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,540
frameworks that a lot of people wouldn't

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,810
know about and it goes all the way back

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,310
to 1996 and it does work in a slightly

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,600
different way which I talked about in my

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,250
other talk which I'm not going to talk

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:15,280
about here after about 2004 you have

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,959
this massive explosion of routing based

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,900
frameworks and that's where the kind of

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,270
real rise of a lightish wait framework

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,040
came about and Django is by far the most

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:31,160
popular Python framework flask is

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,600
probably these days second it's seems to

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,830
be gaining in popularity quite a bit

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,260
it's what they call micro framework

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,610
pyramid is moderately popular I try to

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,550
actually look at this that if someone

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,050
asks me this the other day like how many

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,580
clone sites are out there versus how

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,050
many django sites I'm not sure how you

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,290
work out how many django sites if you

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,780
use a tool like built with it tries to

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,730
analyze lots of technologies that are

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,560
used in different sites and all it has

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,130
the statistics on the the Django

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,330
cross-site scripting integration so and

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm not hundred percent sure if all

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:10,910
Django sites have that so it's probably

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,520
not a good indication Oh so the extra

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,480
line is this there's this other area of

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,549
frameworks which these static site

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,770
generations and they're also becoming

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,600
quite popular I didn't put it here but

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,140
Sphinx as an example whose uses Fink's

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,730
here

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,380
sphynx is pretty cool like the higher

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,820
higher dear of a static site generator

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:33,390
is that you write in restructure text or

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,100
markdown on maybe HTML and then you use

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,480
pipe into on the command line to

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,040
generate something and then push it to a

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,290
web service so there's nothing dynamic

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,830
about it it's not a it's not a dynamic

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:49,680
framework so nickel is an example of

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:53,100
that so CMS is by far the most popular

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,290
CMS by a long margin his wordpress so

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,800
this is this is percentage of the total

00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,620
CMS market as in websites that can be

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,500
identified as having using a CMS I think

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,300
it's something around 30% or like

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,770
there's a good chunk of the total

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,780
websites in the world which are written

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,160
in in WordPress so it's it in some ways

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,690
a good reason not to use WordPress

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,180
because it's very well targeted for

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,040
people trying to hack it doesn't help

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:29,580
that it's written on PHP so it's it's

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:31,890
slightly easier so second is Joomla but

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,830
Joomla seems to be declining a little

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,040
bit and Drupal seems to be increasing so

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,380
this shows them roughly equal but it

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,730
depends on depends a lot on whether

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,070
you're looking at the sort of the 10k

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:49,080
vs. hundred K versus the top million so

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,470
Drupal tends to get used for bigger

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,260
sites so what is the CMS it seems like a

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,920
silly question but I think that not

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,840
everyone is as familiar about what a CMS

00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,690
is and in fact in some communities

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,150
there's a lot of debate you know about

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,160
what a CMS is so on one hand it's an app

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,970
like it's it's something that you build

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,440
and it's an app designed built by

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,160
someone else that you can download and

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
use off the bat

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,620
hopefully not built by you I once gave a

00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:26,479
talk on I went to a a what do you call

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,979
those things an unconference once and

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,409
someone had a talk on why to build your

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,909
own CMS so I wrote a talk and lunch and

00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:37,370
did it afterwards on why not to build

00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:38,990
your own CMS that lets the whole idea of

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,059
the app it's letting people edit content

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,409
and having a separation between content

00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:47,689
and design another way to think of a CMS

00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:49,729
is a big framework some CMS is a more

00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,800
framework II than others but generally

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:54,740
they've they've got this is um just a

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,569
feature list I pull off some site but

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,979
they do an awful lot of things and they

00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,589
have an awful lot of features and they

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,870
and a lot of these things have api's and

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,610
and you have to understand how you want

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,779
to customize them because at the end of

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,089
day you're going to be building a site

00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:09,169
and you want to you might want some of

00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:13,699
these things or not want some of these

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:16,580
things and you're gonna have to know all

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:19,009
those frameworks and all those api's and

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,939
how to get rid of things or change into

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:25,999
what you want so I know the most about

00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:29,749
plone so I'll use plone as an example of

00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:34,639
a CMS so for those who don't know it's

00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:37,669
it's quite a large project that's still

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,849
quite popular it tends to get used in

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:44,149
the big end of town so it has a good

00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:46,159
reputation for security it's open source

00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:48,499
it's not founded by one particular

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:52,399
company it's very much a democratic kind

00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:53,719
of community a bit like Django and it

00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,729
has a really good name for security

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,520
which is partly why the FBI use it as

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:02,599
their main public site among lots of

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,839
governments around the world so I was

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,839
just gonna

00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,669
I've lost my my

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,649
so for those who haven't seen SCMS

00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:22,399
anyone not seeing what a CMS looks like

00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:24,409
when you get it out of the box no the

00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,719
idea is that instead of getting a blank

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,999
sheet of paper like a blank page like

00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:32,089
you would say with a framework you get

00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:36,379
something that has the ability has

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:39,289
navigation maybe has search has the

00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:45,199
ability just to click Edit so you've got

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:47,209
something you can instantly use plan

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:50,540
includes things like you know workflow

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,490
so you can have it submitted and have it

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,750
reviewed as a workflow editor which is a

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,490
little bit different than some others

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,709
and another big thing about a CMS is

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,740
this idea of theming so instead of using

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,029
templates and having you want to what

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,769
you want to do is you want to have the

00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,899
content editors edit the content using

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,259
that interface and then you have theming

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:15,910
being done by another set of people so

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:20,899
if I activate this theme for instance

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,819
then suddenly the whole interface

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,019
changes and how people see it is

00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:29,449
different and a lot of what you're doing

00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,009
has someone who's building CMS's or

00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:33,470
building C makes best websites for other

00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:35,449
people is doing customization creating

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,759
themes getting it to look like a certain

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,309
design or being an integrator and

00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:47,360
bringing in different plugins so that

00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:48,740
here's say a bunch of add-ons some of

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
the theme related some of them you know

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,860
dexterity content types for instance we

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,430
can see that down here it was the

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,430
content types

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,370
content types are quite a common

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,840
seamless thing that's the idea that well

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,970
you've got different kinds of content in

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,160
your system and you want to add

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,870
different fields and you want to give

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:17,940
them you know they're different sorts of

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:21,510
types and so on so that's that's a demo

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,980
of a CMS so that means I can skip

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,180
through all this oh and some CMS is a

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,730
SAS based you know you can like

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,200
wordpress comm for instance so clone for

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,070
instance you can go to plop calm and

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,510
just get an instant plone site you can

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,340
use that theme editor you can edit it

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,760
through the web and create your own very

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,130
customized website Drupal Gardens has is

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,090
is a similar sort of thing with less

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,760
flexibility in terms of theming that's

00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,310
how the theming works so Django based

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,320
CMS is on this mezzanine is Django CMS

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,350
is there any other ones that people have

00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,350
used

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,520
so this was a little bit about you know

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,800
will the what's the difference between a

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,720
simple CMS versus a complex CMS there's

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,180
all sorts of different features that you

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,130
might have and these are some of the

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,710
things that plant has that Django CMS

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,220
didn't seem to have but it's not that

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,350
important that's roughly the same sort

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,940
of thing so one of the questions I want

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,530
to cover is like how do you know it

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,200
seems like again a silly question how do

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,610
you know you're making an app like

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,500
sometimes it's a little bit murky right

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,740
in a slight yeah there's content in the

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,210
site so maybe your CMS is the right

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,000
thing and I don't want to have to like

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,690
you know edit hand code the HTML content

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,800
myself so yeah CMS seems like a good

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:51,240
idea one of the things I think that

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,430
should indicate the making an app is

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,950
where you have wireframes so this is

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,570
actually and that we built this year for

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,890
the new so files pause registry and

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,600
these are all the different screens and

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,280
all the workflows and stuff it's not an

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,250
information architecture it's actually a

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,940
workflow of how do you get information

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,880
through the system and what forms there

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,860
if you're making workflows like

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,600
wireframes like this then where you're

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,490
you know you're placing buttons and

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,010
you've got you know entering forms etc

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,410
etc that's a really good indication that

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:28,410
you're building an app you want that

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,240
level of customization this is by the

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,400
way a really cool tool called dough

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,140
mockingbird it's a as anyone use

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,630
balsamic it's another wire framing tool

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,370
I think it's a little bit better because

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,170
it's HTML based and you can collaborate

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,740
and you can share links and stuff and

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,630
it's also more free than pasta makers

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,580
but really great communications tool so

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,750
going on from tennessee's talk where

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,730
he's talking about like how do you

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,560
actually sort of communicate how do you

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,170
have this barrier between you know you

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,890
text on them and and got agreement and

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,020
they say yeah that's that's what we want

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,940
so content so one of the things you'll

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,530
see where the content site is sitemaps

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,150
you know and information architecture

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,310
someone mentions information

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:14,330
architecture that's more a content kind

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:17,760
of site most web sites are content sites

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,410
so if you're a say web agency like mine

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,910
and you're building web sites chances

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,910
are you're building content types

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,510
so another way to think about you know

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,210
the difference between you know what

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,410
kind of tool you should use is to think

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:40,110
about different roles involved so in

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,330
order to explain this I'm gonna I'm

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,610
gonna use my heavy weapon which is

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,660
figurines I think figurines are a great

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,760
way to explain any concept so if you

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,400
think about three non-technical kind of

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,650
roles that are CMS is designed to handle

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,630
this is this is from a CMS point of view

00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,850
right a CMS is all about having

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,890
different interfaces for these different

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,040
people and letting them do their job

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,960
well so you have quantitative side

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,850
admins and and reviewers reviewers of

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,350
people who don't necessarily either the

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,500
content themselves will create the

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,180
content but they're people who use the

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,530
workflow to give authorization for it to

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,840
go live they're probably the least

00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,570
technical site admins might set

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,050
permissions and workflow policies

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,690
and content editors that people writing

00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,519
the actual pages and titles and and to

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,250
some extent doing have a navigation

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,750
structure a little bit now you might

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,630
have an integrator integrators someone

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,300
who is somewhat technical they should

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,310
depending on the CMS some CMS's mean you

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,839
have to be very technical to bring all

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,139
the plugins together and make it all

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,930
work then you've got a front-end

00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,399
developer or Athena and then you've got

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,440
someone who knows the whole framework

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,779
inside out and can write plug-ins and

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,220
and can pretty much do anything they

00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:02,430
want with a CMS or with a framework so

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,139
if you're a developer say and you're

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,600
reasonably technical and you're just

00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,949
building something for yourself so

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,540
you're kind of let's say you're an

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:14,009
integrator content writer one thing you

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,230
could use the static side generation

00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:18,690
it's it's becoming very popular with

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,490
exactly that kind of community it's not

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,730
something that you can give to someone

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:28,230
who's non-technical that often and say

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,670
go and build your blog this way but for

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,959
someone who's technical it's it's a

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,649
great solution because it's really

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:38,339
lightweight and incredibly easy to host

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,690
because all it does is generate HTML so

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,959
if you're an app like we talked about

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,430
for an app or startup the thing about an

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,560
apperance startup is you want complete

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,839
control you want the ability to move

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,209
buttons left right and center all over

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,060
the page and you want your interaction

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:55,230
to be very very under your control and

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,339
you don't necessarily have a lot of

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,779
content you might consider say Facebook

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,430
they have a lot of content but in actual

00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,860
fact Facebook's content is user

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,959
generated content and what you're not

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,209
generating that as part of your

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,000
development process so you've got a very

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:15,949
technical team onboard who want complete

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,949
control what you want is a framework

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,690
so a simple blog you might have a

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,010
content editor and then you've got

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,120
you're going to pull from the cloud

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,560
you're gonna pull your plugins and

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,570
you're going to pull your themes perhaps

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,200
and maybe not even customize the thing

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,430
you're just going to use an

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,390
off-the-shelf

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,950
you know WordPress themes for instance

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,050
and you may have the whole thing cloud

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,660
hosted maybe you like wordpress.com or

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,950
something it's a large content site this

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,110
is where you really need all these

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,820
different roles that play right you know

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,940
you're a large organization and imagine

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,800
you're you know like the government

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,280
department like the Victoria seus for

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,780
instance they've got reviewers they

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,310
don't let certain things go live they've

00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,200
got you know they've got their doing a

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,030
little bit of integration they're doing

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,150
the theme themselves so they've got sort

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,699
of front-end people there and they're

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:11,110
also using plugins and everything that

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,490
they're getting out of the cloud so

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,930
that's what you really need in it what's

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,339
got an enterprise CMAs when you say lean

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,670
talk about like complicated workflows

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,140
and permission structures that's what

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,079
you need so if your web consultancy like

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,329
mine you'll tend to have some technical

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,990
people on board you may do your own

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,340
development of plugins you may not but

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,960
what you're doing is you're building

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,070
sites again and again and again and

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,720
you're handing those over to other

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:40,480
people who are non-technical so that's

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,950
really a CMS but you can also if you're

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,200
doing something happy maybe you want to

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,050
use a framework in that case a lot of

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,360
consultancies will I know quite a few

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:53,640
plain consultancies that do porn and

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,080
Django or Drupal and Django or

00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,040
combinations of different CMS's and a

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:04,120
lightweight framework so one of the

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,910
problems with CMS's I think is is this

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,380
idea of estimating effort and knowing

00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,600
whether you've gone too far with the

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,340
wrong tool because if you've got a

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,050
framework and you're you're if it is

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,330
kind of linear you start with very

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,340
little functionality and you might use a

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,050
few plugins but generally you're just

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,970
gonna build most things from scratch

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,129
because you're building a custom unique

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,429
app

00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:30,139
now CMS to get those a certain number of

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,149
features it might be really easy you get

00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:34,369
a lot out of the box but then you hit

00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:36,889
this point at which you try to customize

00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:38,419
far too much you're working you're

00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:40,489
fighting the framework and at which

00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,789
point if you'd started with a framework

00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:46,339
that gave you that flexibility from the

00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,719
beginning then you probably would have

00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:50,119
spent less effort

00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:51,859
how does think about this though is this

00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,399
not always the way easy to work out at

00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:57,979
the beginning it's obscured and this can

00:18:55,399 --> 00:19:00,459
be solved by understanding the framework

00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:03,289
really really well

00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:04,909
unfortunately big frameworks like the

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,039
CMS's are actually really hard to

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,929
understand so really good again for a

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,759
web consultancy if you're just starting

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:15,619
out maybe you're better off with a

00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:18,099
framework so this kind of summarizes

00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,099
that to some extent

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,400
so the converse of this customization

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,810
quest is you might end up reinventing

00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
the world for instance if you start

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,430
making something that allows you it

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,280
people people to edit content you're

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,780
building your own CMS and you may be

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,550
spending a lot of effort and you can get

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,680
something that is secure and well

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:47,040
supported off the shelf with an

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,250
off-the-shelf CMS so microframeworks

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,890
I'm just going to skip this basically

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,570
the idea is that I think there's it's

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,730
less important at the difference these

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,780
days you know Django you can you can get

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,160
rid of the ORM if you want if you know a

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:09,780
framework already stick to the framework

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:11,430
that you're working with and I want to

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,480
talk a little bit about the ideas of

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,320
what happens if you if you need

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,440
something that's mainly content with a

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,630
bit of an app or something that has you

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,130
know as mainly an app but you've got

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,480
like this section of it like which is a

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,880
Help section and it's got lots of

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,520
content so what are the options for sort

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,380
of combining the two things so one of

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,480
the simplest option is you can just have

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,000
different domains different or use your

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,680
URL rewrites and just theme the two

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,810
things to look kind of similar you know

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,880
this is used a lot for say blogs people

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:44,700
might have a wordpress blog associated

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,500
with their app and you'll see a lot of

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,680
times they're just changing the domain

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,090
name and it looks kind of similar the

00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,370
downside and that one is yeah obviously

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,930
your navigation structure has to if you

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,490
change from one part then you can't you

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,130
have to go and copy it across and re

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,760
theme the other thing to have the same

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:04,110
navigation structure so I frames there's

00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,840
another option that's actually what we

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,160
did with this site for various reasons

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,680
that were out of control out of control

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:15,570
the bottom section there is using

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:18,060
iframes Ajax is very similar what's

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,400
going on here is that the request goes

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,530
to your CMS back to the browser then the

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,240
browser makes the substance called Ajax

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:31,440
to combine it together with JavaScript

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:32,580
or iframes is just another web call one

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,980
thing you can do is you can use the

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,070
underlying CMS to build say a plug-in

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,510
like a

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,850
content-type or something like that so

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,170
that's what we did in this example

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,550
because it was mainly a Content sign we

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,920
just wanted one section which was kind

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,480
of happy a lot of people get stuck by

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,470
trying to reuse stuff that's already out

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,730
there so what I think people should do

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,080
more as they should try and use the

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,210
underlying framework so if you're using

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,850
Django CMS obviously it's a no-brainer

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,430
that you use Django not everyone in the

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,380
plone world tries to go back to the to

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,690
the bear framework underneath they

00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,690
should do that more often I think you

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,130
can use things like in this case we used

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,600
what would be considered a framework on

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:20,080
top of plan itself I won't go into that

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,460
proxying is not you can do it it's not

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,840
such a great idea

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,440
that's what they actually do on this

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,260
site this wasn't done by us but one

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,460
problem with this is that you or CMS is

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,560
sitting there waiting for this back-end

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,440
request to finish and if your CMS has

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,970
heavy Fred's as if it's got like you

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,820
know thread-local storage for instance

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:45,430
then you're limiting your capability to

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:47,500
serve requests insight includes is

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,420
another interesting area that's probably

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,950
not used that much so the idea of an

00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,440
insight included is you put a little

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,940
syntax into your HTML then use something

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,150
like in Gen X or varnish we'll look at

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,770
that outside include and say ok actually

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,060
there's another bit I have to get they

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,900
go and get that other bit and stick it

00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:08,650
in we've developed some extra whiskey

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:10,870
either way to do this in a more

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,570
complicated way because standard insight

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,690
includes wouldn't let you for instance

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:18,820
proxy a a post request we've written

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,570
whiskey middleware that at this point

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:25,510
here will store the post data and if it

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:28,300
actually has this special another extra

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,140
special harm syntax it will repost that

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,630
post request here to the the external

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,490
app and send the whole lot back and what

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:40,180
that allows us to do is it allows us to

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,560
use all the security and in say the CMS

00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,620
to say well you're allowed to view this

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:53,160
page or you're allowed to view this app

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:54,750
and then have that still be used so my

00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,030
summary is that you know CMS is good for

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,309
content if you want a Content sign it's

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:02,550
good if you have to hand your site over

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:04,520
to non-technical people and that's where

00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,720
I think some framework people go wrong

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,380
they don't really think about what

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,620
happens after they've built the site

00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:16,200
frameworks are good for unique apps

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:19,290
CMS is good for unique apps and content

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,840
with some kind of combination but really

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,880
if you know what you're doing

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,490
but it really anything can do anything

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,960
if you know what you're doing the more

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,150
complex firm is the harder is to know

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,309
what you're doing I think that's one of

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,130
the big lessons but you know trust me

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:36,809
I'm a professional I know what I'm doing

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:45,360
and we're hiring if you also know what

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:47,010
you're doing thank you have a few

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,520
minutes for questions if someone wants

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,520
to hold a hand up

00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,080
missile inside

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,499
it's a high Australian hand retriever

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,730
statistics and we have a problem in our

00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:10,190
site that we've want to expose our data

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,809
from a dynamic database the same time

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:17,200
make the data available for google

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:19,970
searching yes so how would you sort of

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,940
same time get dynamic data which can be

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,450
available through a query but let Google

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:30,620
search it there's a couple ways to do it

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:33,230
like one is to use the lightweight

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,619
framework to make a bunch of pages that

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,259
have all the data on it so obviously if

00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:41,360
you've got like you know a database that

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,919
has thousands and thousands of pages

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,690
you're gonna have to pay the price of

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,179
Google trying to crawl all of it and

00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,159
that it's not so good so here's an

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,710
example where we deliberately designed

00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,169
the pages so they can be quilt it goes

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,970
in this is a specialized thing for it

00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:57,950
uploads all the the timetabling

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,440
information for only for school routes

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,470
and New South Wales and displays so you

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,009
can get a personalized page and routes

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,070
for the particular schools yeah and what

00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:11,809
we did is is we we developed a custom

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,960
content type or data base for that and

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,519
allowed Google to crawl all that so

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,029
there if you tighten or Sydney boys and

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:23,480
it's going to come up I'm not sure if

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:25,070
there are actual more specifically ap is

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,429
that you can use to sort of say here's

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,029
an app type thing and get Google to

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:31,129
crawl it

00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,080
pretty much it's got to be crawlable by

00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:38,899
the web to make it indexable by Google

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:41,419
so I I was wondering in when you get a

00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:46,399
CMS you basically get a gigantic bucket

00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:49,789
of of tools is there like a business

00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:51,769
load in getting too much for free yeah

00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,929
absolutely I think I think knows the

00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:56,450
biggest thing that people got you know

00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:58,129
actually this is mostly what I want

00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,159
night it's 90% what I want all I got to

00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:02,869
do is customize it and and if you don't

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,369
you'll find out the limitations as you

00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:08,290
go through it there's a you know

00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,420
psychological

00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,010
thing that the paradox of choice if you

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,410
have too many choices you have this sort

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,810
of you can become paralyzed and you can

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,550
have an unhappy experience because you

00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,900
don't really have enough information or

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,880
enough knowledge to know which is the

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,890
right choice and people will often

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,270
choose not to choose even though it's

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,710
not to their advantage they could just

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,900
pick randomly and they'd be better off

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,440
and I think that happens and software a

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,250
lot and that's part of the reason why

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,650
brain and like the lighter-weight

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,530
frameworks are you know popular it's

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:41,860
it's it's kind of easier to basically

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,150
sit down and say you know I know what

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,050
I'm getting I know what I have to build

00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:50,020
it's predictable I don't have to choose

00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:53,020
so dealing is appreciation for your talk

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,790

00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:58,480
