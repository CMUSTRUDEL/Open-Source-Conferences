they've worked incredibly long hours

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,810
through each day of this conference and

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,639
their work in recording the proceedings

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,589
of the three tracks at this conference

00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,569
means that the global Python community

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,050
can reap the benefits of our work at

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:08,050
this conference

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,350

able to facilitate a day of in-depth

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,110
material for two great communities in

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,910
the Python ecosystem was a massive

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,610
highlight of the two years we spent

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,710

from 630pm onwards it's a walk downs

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,410
sandy bay road or about a five-minute

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,330
cab journey there's basically as craft

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,470
beer and burgers to be had so if you're

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,970

your flight is late feel free to join us

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,830
there and help us celebrate the end of

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,890
our rotation here in Hobart the

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,450
conference Sprint's which Tim are so

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,010
well advertised they aren't going to be

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,140
in the derwent rooms back where the mini

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:53,790
cops were on Friday Monday and Tuesday

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,500
doors open at 9am and every talk that

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,050
you missed is still available to be seen

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,060
they'll be going up on our YouTube

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,280
channel within the week and hopefully on

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,080
pie video org and we thank of course New

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:11,250
Relic for sponsoring that and next day

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:13,920
video for doing the recording I think

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:18,480
told to mention the lost and found check

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,370
out the lost and found if you can so as

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,660
the conference draws to a close i'd like

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,400
to share with you some thoughts on the

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,430
time we've had spent organizing the

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,410
conference here in Hobart now firstly

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,730
being able to grow this conference to

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,710
the point where we could sustain a

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,080
financial aid scheme to rival that of

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,110
Pike on us has been a long-held goal of

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,700
mine the contributions of both Google

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,530
and the Python software foundation

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,720
helping us achieve this goal cannot be

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,250
understated to those of you who've

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,130
attended the conference because of this

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,240
I hope you've gained from the events

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,520
because we've gained from your presence

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,420
here go forth and share the results of

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,490
your attendance from this conference as

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,740
a result of working on the conference

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,180
last year I personally was nominated as

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,950
a member of the Python software

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,020
foundation and thanks to their

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,050
generosity I attended pike on us this

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,760
year I'm pretty certain that a large

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,750
number of the international speakers who

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,330
have got here did so as a result of my

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,730
shilling the conference at PyCon us this

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,740
year and that's helped us raise the

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,470
profile of this conference and Python in

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,180
Australia immensely as many people have

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,260
alluded to today the Python Software

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,150
Foundation has moved to

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,040
new open membership model this year and

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,380
I really strongly encourage you to join

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,140
so that you can help us he'll figure

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,640
figure out how to help grow the Python

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,840
community in Australia and around the

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,460
world so yes please join speak to Alex

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,750
or Kenneth he'll tell you details about

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,350
the membership structure because I'm not

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,540
quite familiar with it not quite open

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:53,370
yet but will be by the in the next few

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:55,200
months great ok cool um so everything

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,690
I've talked about today and yesterday

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,390
morning has led to Python Australia

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,180
being the biggest ever this year we had

00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,160
more proposals for talks more sponsors a

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,060
longer conference and more attendees

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,060
than ever before

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:17,430
that we've achieved such a level of

00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,680
growth this year whilst in Hobart of all

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,089
places speaks volumes of the goodwill

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,450
that we have built up in the community

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:26,670
over the past year important truth this

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,680
conference whilst something I personally

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,649
care very deeply about is not just my

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,510
own work without a strong driven team

00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,670
this event would not have been possible

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,500
let alone to the standard at which we

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,470
produced it and I'd like to thank each

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,330
member of our team individually firstly

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,959
our program committee chair where are

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,450
you Richard hello he's facilitated the

00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,160
cfp and talk selection for the past two

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,470
years and his stewardship of this

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,660
process has resulted in a consistently

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,459
high standard of program and this year

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,980
we feel that it rivals the best regional

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:02,450
pythons throughout the world like you to

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,450
come and get your staff jumper Richard

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:14,420
you're welcome to our outer core team

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,790
Josh Despres who's run code Wars for the

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,590
past two years and to kc farrell for

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,510
being our mini confronted this year

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,400
their contribution has made sure that we

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,050
could grow the conference and the events

00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,240
in this conference without causing an

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,240
extra imposter up on the core team

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,700
our treasurer for making sure that the

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,900
entire event ran to budget their

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,180
sponsors have paid up and that our

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,000
suppliers were paid Matthews diligence

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,010
attention to detail and sheer pedantry

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,420
has helped us to be confident that this

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,420
event has been a financial success

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,180
and finally my co lead organizer

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,100
Joshua's vast knowledge of event

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,529
planning contacts within the industry

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,850
here an amazing attention to detail has

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:07,610
made the logistics of this event

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,949
impeccable that every event was properly

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,600
staffed that every delegate present was

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:15,309
catered for correctly shows the fruits

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,309
of his work please thank Joshua

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,360
in just two little pieces of

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,130
housekeeping there are a few leftover

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,900
t-shirts so if you never got any you're

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,640
welcome to come pick one up even if you

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,020
didn't order one and if the volunteers

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,090
would like to meet me in the organizers

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,440
room after this would love to thank

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,990
you've got a little present for all of

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:49,130
you he never stops being the organizer

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:50,360
of this so I can truly say that this

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,770
conference would not have become the

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,690
success that it has been over the last

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,990
two years without the help of everyone

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,510
on the core team so thank you so much um

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,610
I feel as though through this rotation

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,350
here in Hobart bike on australia has

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,150
become one of the truly great python

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,790
conferences throughout the world which

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,550
embodies the spirit of knowledge respect

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,970
tenacity and encouragement that the

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,770
Python community prides itself upon the

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,230
motto for the big pike on this year was

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,450
to change the future this is a message

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,100
that we should not let go to waste once

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,020
you leave this building share the

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,630
enthusiasm that you've experienced and

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,730
build a community that embodies the

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,870
values that you saw here wherever it is

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,850
that you go to within the next few days

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,950
in closing it's been a huge honor to

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,600
help to build and to hold stewardship

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,540
over this conference over the last two

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,430
years and likewise it's been a privilege

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,100
to share the place that I call home with

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,430
this amazing community thank you and

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,430
