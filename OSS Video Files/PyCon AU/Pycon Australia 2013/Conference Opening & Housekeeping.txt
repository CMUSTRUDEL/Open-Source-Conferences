March and we feel the quality of the

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,800
program that our program committee

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,390
assembled this year really reflects the

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,090
high standard of submissions that we

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,530

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,700
fantastic conference and it's thanks to

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,079

Django at this conference please thank

in there are more people at this year's

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,740
conference than any other pike on

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,650
Australia before it we have students who

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,790
are growing into the Python community

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,710
enthusiasts who are in first enough to

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,540
intend on up to attend here on their own

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,850
pocket professionals who are working

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,619
with Python on a daily basis this

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,080
conference attracts pipe from users of

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,869
all varieties and I think this

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,390
delegation really shows that there are

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:51,759
more countries represented this year not

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,130
just people from Australia the year the

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,009
United States New Zealand Singapore

00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:01,810
China India from Europe and even Asia

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,210
this conference has wider reach than any

00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,190
pipe on Australia before it and that

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,200
people have travelled to this conference

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,970
while another major Python conference is

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,470
running in another part of the world is

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,880
a testament to the strength of the

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,290
Australian Python community that we've

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,900
been building over the last three years

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:20,670
so before we even begin this conference

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,670
thank you all for making this possible

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,640
so we have some housekeeping before we

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:36,099
kick the conference off this conference

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,519
is subject to the Linux Australia code

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,440
of conduct so basically be nice to

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,700
people wherever possible we'd really

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,470
appreciate that and if you do have any

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,050
issues with the conduct of people at

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,310
this conference it's very easy to find

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,010
people who are involved with the

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,459
conference our core staff including

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,230
myself Joshua hesketh who is my co lead

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,330
organizer who's taking care of logistics

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,790
Matthew D'Orazio who is our treasurer

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,560
our alpha team members Casey Farrell and

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,299
Josh Despres we're all wearing green

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,280
lanyards and that will help you find us

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,840
our volunteers who help keep the the

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,760
conference running and help keep people

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,819
out of our way will be wearing red

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:24,340
lanyards that's how you find staff a few

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,590
notices yes sir that code was there was

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,420
a mixup with some of the t-shirt sizes I

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,130
believe that there were some mediums

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,859
mixed up in the large pile and vice

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,200
versa so if you expected a medium and

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:38,230
have a large I go see the registration

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,639
desk and sort that out now if you want

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,069
to attend the conference dinner tonight

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,079
the swag voucher that is inside your

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,989
badge will not admit you to the dinner

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:49,450
you need to see the swag collection line

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,230
in the registration desk and swap that

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,660
out for actual dinner tickets finally if

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,840
you arrive late to a session that is in

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,340
this room here the doors actually open

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,560
out onto the stage as I'm sure you've

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,840
noticed there is a late entrance which

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,060
is next to the registration desk I just

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,130
chat to the registration desk people and

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,810
they'll let you up here now we're

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,220
recording from up the back of the room

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,420
and having people walk in through the

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,489
front of the room is really distracting

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,989
both to our recordings and to our

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,289
speakers who we want to give really high

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,729
quality presentations if you want to

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,680
present a lightning talk we have a

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,539
session at the end of today our

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,440
lightning talks will go 45 minutes each

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:33,220
it's at 20 25 and it will be in here

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,159
we'll have a signup board outside in the

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,040
exhibition foyer we have an open space

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,020
and a speaker

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,520
lounge downstairs in the Wellington room

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,300
so if you want to run a birds of feather

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,190
session or something like that you can

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,810
use the open space to that and if you're

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,390
a speaker who wants to work on slides in

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,790
a quiet place our Wellington room is

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,290
good for that as well we also expect

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,480
have a jobs board up in the exhibition

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,910
foyer so if you are hiring or looking

such conferences in Australia and we'd

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:12,250
like to thank them for their ongoing

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:14,720
support finally I'd like to mention our

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,360
financial aid program which is how we've

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,370
run diversity and outreach this year

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,650
this helps us grow the Python community

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,540
in Australia by helping to connect

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,810
people who couldn't otherwise attend

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,590
with the global Python community I

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,140
personally and on behalf of this

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,180
conference benefited hugely from Pike on

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,010
North America's aid this scheme this

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,680
year and I'm very proud to be able to

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,240
bring that to Australia we're able to

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,970
run this program thanks to two of our

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,950
sponsors firstly Google Australia who

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,590
have sponsored gender diversity at pycon

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,450
since 2011 and they've really stepped up

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,550
this year and they've helped us bring

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,220
great female our speakers and delegates

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,950
from as far afield as the United States

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,480
and the Python Software Foundation who

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,820
upon hearing that we wanted to run a

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,110
program like there's offered us double

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,450
the amount of sponsorship that we

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,220
originally asked for thanks to these

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,290
partners and our other sponsors and

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,750
those of you who purchased professional

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,030
level tickets in record numbers we're

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,160
able to devote in excess of ten thousand

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,050
dollars to bring some twenty people who

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,640
otherwise couldn't have attended to this

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,640
conference so thank

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,340
the rewards of our outreach efforts

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,200
spread far beyond the confines of this

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,150
conference it helps us to grow the

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,370
Python community throughout Australia

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,500
and into the rest of the world as well

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,510
as assisting speakers we've helped to

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,370
assist students who might be able to

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,010
begin to actively contribute to Python

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,870
projects educators who can bring the

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,480
cutting edge of Python to a new

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,310
generation of programmers and community

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,680
members who can instill the spirit of

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,790
the Python community into software and

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,350
and other communities around the world

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,240
we're very able are pleased to be able

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,950
to share the Python community with even

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,779
more of you this year so those of you

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,460
who've received help we hope you get a

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:08,410

so with no further delay it's time to

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,380
kick off the proceedings of pike on
