Have you ever found yourself obsessively checking the UPS or FedEx tracking site to see if your package finally got delivered at your doorstep?  Or wondered when your contractor/gardener showed up to do their job?  Or if your neighbor came looking for you on an urgent matter while you were out?

In this talk, I will show you how you can relax and rely on your handy-dandy smartphone to let you know when these events happen along wit

next speaker is Roopa - err she's the

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,549
founder and president of code chicks dog

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,170
which is a California nonprofit

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,670
organization with chapters across the

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,260
u.s. she's also a member of the

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,240
technical staff at VMware working on

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,620
vSphere she's been a software developer

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,910
and tinkerer for two decades and loves

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,830
to learn new technologies and build new

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,240
skills to show us instantaneous

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,750
notifications with Arduino and Raspberry

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:32,820
Pi

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:34,890
please welcome Roopa to share hi

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,590
everyone welcome to my talk on Arduino

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,059
and Raspberry Pi and how I'm using both

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,390
of these gadgets to do some home

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,530
automation in my house my name is

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,430
Roberta share as as he mentioned so I

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,260
call this project fly doorbell because

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,219
I'm using the Raspberry Pi and I'm

00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,750
mostly using Python 4 for actually

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,629
building it it's my goal to enhance this

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,640
project in phases up to a point where I

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,100
can have a two-way communication with

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,720
whoever is at my front door

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,200
and I want this communication to be done

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,670
within minutes of them arriving

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,619
regardless of where I am so I could be

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,560
here in Australia I could be in Japan I

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,200
could be in my backyard you know having

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,240
a drink and I don't want to get up so

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,979
but I want to know who's there at my

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,009
front door and just kind of have a

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,479
conversation so that's essentially what

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,479
I wanted to do first off I'm delighted

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,860
to be here it's a beautiful place I

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,710
would really like to thank the

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,600
organizers from Python Australia

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,439
specifically Chris did an awesome job

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,700
and secondly I would not be here if it

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,220
wasn't for the Python Software

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,680
Foundation and their funding for the

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,540
diversity and outreach program so I'm

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,729
I'm absolutely thrilled and honored to

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,180
be here and thank you so much for making

00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,180
that possible

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,970
so this is kind of a rundown of what its

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,990
gonna happen at this talk so I'm going

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,420
to talk about the problem

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm going to talk about the phases of my

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,880
project at least what I'm thinking right

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,850
now the solution and why I chose that

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,010
solution do a very very brief comparison

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,550
between the Raspberry Pi the Arduino and

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,780
the Beagle bone white and I'll show all

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,230
the hardware actually all the hardware

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm using is right here and do a live

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,520
demo and then show most of the code I

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,310
also have a backup video in case

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,830
something goes wrong and I have a flight

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,959
on the issues I'm running into right now

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,690
and some of the future work that I'm

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,870
thinking of doing and QA so what

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:56,980
happened is I did the first phase of

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,690
this talk in PyCon USA in March and I

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,160
ran out of time so I couldn't take any

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,050
Q&A so if you have some you know really

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,530
quick questions while I'm doing the talk

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,060
you know

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,519
please don't hesitate to just you know

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,769
yell out say hey you know blah blah blah

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,650
whatever whatever you want to ask and I

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,830
will be happy to answer in case I run

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,600
out again I will be outside feel free to

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:26,290
grab me you know I'm happy to answer any

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,410
questions you'd like so yeah so what is

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,670
the problem that I wanted to solve I

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,790
wanted to know who was at my front door

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,340
I wanted to know what date and time they

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:40,390
showed up and I wanted to be notified

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:44,519
pretty instantaneously when they arrived

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:51,070
and I was looking ideally for less than

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:52,989
yeah ten seconds and this was mostly

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,970
driven by the need that I had

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,519
contractors and package delivery people

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,080
gardeners neighbors and all kinds of

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,299
people just showing up at my front door

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,280
and I wasn't there

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,680
and I didn't know why they were there or

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:11,470
you know what they were doing so that's

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,569
pretty much what drove this so here are

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,419
the phases of my project as I see it

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,790
right now so phase one was when someone

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,470
shows up at my front door I take a

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,460
snapshot and then I send that to my

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:27,820
phone via SMS and that's what I

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,400
presented at PyCon us in March phase two

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,280
is taking a video clip of the visitor

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,650
and I have a sub phase 2.1 which isn't

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,930
also an audio clip and sending that to

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,450
my phone phase 3 is a live video stream

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,900
one way only and then also I wanted to

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,570
do an audio notification to whoever came

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,730
up saying hey you know welcome will be

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,960
you know chatting or something something

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,460
to make them feel comfortable that they

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:02,080
were you know being viewed phase 4 is

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,950
two-way audio and phase 5 incredibly

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,810
ambitious two-way audio and video so

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,460
that's what I'm thinking of right now

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,590
somewhere in there I want to do some

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,020
face recognition stuff but we'll see how

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,930
that goes

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,539
so what I really wanted to present today

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,780
was phase 3 which was like a live video

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:26,039
stream but my water heater broken so I

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:31,720
didn't have time to do anything so today

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:34,330
I'll be doing phase 2 so let's say I

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,990
have a contractor that comes to my front

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,870
door to do some work what happens is my

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,190
proximity sensor which is right here

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:49,840
you know outfits a change signal to the

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,060
Arduino which is right there the Arduino

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,620
then relays the change signal to the

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,950
referee pi which is right here the

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,410
Raspberry Pi then instructs the webcam

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:09,789
right here to start taking a video clip

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:11,560
and an audio clip the webcam then takes

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,480
the video an audio clip and sends it

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,550
back to the Raspberry Pi

00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Raspberry Pi then uploads this video

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,070
audio clip to somewhere in the cloud and

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,530
then sends an SMS to my phone notifying

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:32,150
me so that's pretty much my entire

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:34,520
project on a slide so this is what I'm

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,310
going to be talking about and showing

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,250
today is phase two as I mentioned video

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,570
clip of the visitor who shows up at the

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,080
front door and I'm going to ask for a

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,580
volunteer from the audience I will also

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,930
take an audio clip it's a 10 second

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,810
capture and this is something I discover

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,820
just about a week ago is I didn't occur

00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,080
to me that Tullio would not be supported

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,880
outside the US so I wasn't able to send

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,150
an SMS to my phone

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,460
in Australia so I reverted to my backup

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,970
mode and integrated with Twitter so at

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:15,410
least I could tweet so that's what I'm

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,090
going to be showing today so why did I

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,230
choose the solution because there are

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:24,190
other ways to do this the primary reason

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,440
was it's reasonably inexpensive

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:31,340
everything included is less than 100

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,040
bucks and I looked and I couldn't find

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,060
anything commercial that would give me

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,340
the features that I needed particularly

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,660
sending me a notification to my film so

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,640
there are a lot of security cams and

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,280
monitoring services which are also

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,800
pretty pricey so I didn't want to pay

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,540
that much and also they didn't give me

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,270
the feature of notifying me on my phone

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:56,240
so that's kind of the main reason I

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,910
chose the solution also to learn about

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,250
hardware and to build my own solution

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,750
that way I could tweak it whichever way

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,130
I wanted and nobody could tell me you

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,340
can't do this or I can't do that or you

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:11,320
have to pay more so that's the second

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,320
reason and I get to speak at conferences

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,190
this has turned out to be interesting

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,990
because almost everywhere else I've

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,450
submitted this this proposal has been

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,050
accepted

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,090
and so now I have this dilemma of trying

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,640
to use all my vacation which is very

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,130
precious you know in the u.s. to go to

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,960
conference with it's fake but it's

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,200
something I'm totally willing to do and

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,690
also to inspire others and I didn't

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,980
realize this the first time I spoke

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:47,260
which is in PyCon us that there are

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,130
people all over the world especially

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,670
young girls that really need to see

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,650
women talk about technical stuff

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,750
particularly you know gadgets related

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:02,530
stuff or Robotics related stuff which

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,220
it's kind of cool and it came home to me

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,300
when somebody from Brazil tweeted that

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,950
he was showing his nine-year-old

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:15,490
daughter the video from PyCon us and

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:18,310
that's when it's really thanking oh they

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,610
need to do this so yeah so these are

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,120
these are the reasons so this is all the

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,530
hardware that I used I'll go left to

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,060
right and top so the proximity sensor

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,070
connected via breadboard and jumper

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,610
waters to the Arduino I'm using the

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,950
Arduino Uno r3 and that's connected to

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,380
the Raspberry Pi which is also connected

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,990
to the webcam and the connections from

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:51,340
the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi is USB

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:57,790
and so is the webcam this is a a picture

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:59,320
of the SMS showing up on my iPhone this

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,760
is a picture of the tweet showing up on

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,710
my iPhone and when I click on the URL on

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,530
the on the tweet it takes me to Dropbox

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,780
which is what I'm using for this for

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:17,040
this face or you can see the video and

00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:19,390
audio clip so a really quick run-through

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,150
I'm not going to go over everything on

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,790
the slide main things Raspberry Pi has

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,620
runs full stack Linux

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,960
it has Ethernet and SD card support and

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,490
one of the main reasons that

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:38,070
I did not hook up the sensor directly to

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,779
the Raspberry Pi through GPIO is because

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:47,520
I read on many forums that it gave a lot

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,050
of flaky readings because we've got the

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,140
time-sensitive applications we're giving

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:55,110
flaky readings so that's one of the

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,510
reasons I actually am using the Arduino

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,930
I shouldn't need to use the argument of

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,209
for this I haven't had time to actually

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,720
test this myself to see if all these

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:12,180
sites are actually valid but that's on

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,740
my to-do list here's a really busy slide

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,390
with arduino r pi and beyond white

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:23,220
comparisons the key things here I just

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:25,140
want to point out is price it's 30 bucks

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,470
for the Arduino you know 35 for the

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:34,310
Raspberry Pi and like hundred bucks for

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:38,760
the big one being white Ram let's see

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:42,330
two kilobytes sorry 32 what am I reading

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,070
I can't wait from here anyway 256 Meg's

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,560
for both the Raspberry Pi and the Beagle

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,230
bone and I believe it's like 2 K flash

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:58,100
for for that we're doing no runo

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:59,580
key things oh there's a model B okay

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:07,380
that's incorrect

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:08,820
okay USB ports so the right way pi has

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,150
two years reports which is what I'm

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,880
using the Beulah White has one and the

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,430
video and output the r pi is the only

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,459
one that has issue my support which

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,459
eventually I want to use for something

00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,119
so here's pretty much all the software

00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:31,459
that I wrote now I have an Arduino

00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:34,850
sketch that reads the applet from the

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:37,879
sensor and then all the heavy lifting is

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,999
done on the Raspberry Pi with two Python

00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,759
scripts so the first one is PI doorbell

00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,429
recognizer del pi which reads the output

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,730
from the Arduino and then it does this

00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:53,869
object detection debouncing very crude

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,889
debouncing algorithm and then it takes

00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:59,959
the video clip and sends a message using

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:02,149
ffmpeg to the webcam to to take the

00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,709
video and audio clip and then it uploads

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:08,809
the video choose to whichever site I

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:11,269
choose and then it calls send

00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:14,929
notification stop I to actually send the

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:18,439
URL to whichever notification mechanism

00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,959
I choose so in send notifications to PI

00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:24,230
it actually takes a configurable

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:28,040
parameter to either send an SMS or tweet

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:33,379
and so that's that's how the the URL is

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:35,839
sent a quick snapshot of the proximity

00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,149
sensor and the model number HCS are

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,589
there before the maximum range for this

00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:45,589
is 16 feet I have it calibrated at about

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:47,569
30 inches so anybody who walks up to

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,049
less than 30 inches is going to be

00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:50,049
detected

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:59,360
this is Arduino Uno r3 which is what I'm

00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:01,369
using I have another picture okay this

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,269
is not that you know r3 is Omega

00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:09,079
but the key things are kind of similar

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:12,799
the digital i/o pins I have power and

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:16,069
ground I'm using the external power and

00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,319
I'm using the USB port and that's pretty

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:22,129
much it that I'm using I'm not using

00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:23,959
anything else for this project this is

00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,879
how it's tied up with the power and

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,470
ground the red and blue wires and then I

00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:31,399
have the echo and trigger pins going

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,379
from green and yellow wires and I have

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,880
it set up I'm going to put it out in the

00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,440
open space room

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,000
feel free to come by and you know take a

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,580
look and see so are doing a deaf set up

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
this was super simple you just go to our

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,510
do a note out CC and and download the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,990
DEP kit hook it up to your Mac or a PC

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,670
or whichever UNIX box you like and then

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,190
look at some example sketches there are

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,450
a whole bunch of them so typically you

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,960
know blinking lights and stuff and

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,920
that's pretty much it so it was really

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:10,470
easy to do and that's my Raspberry Pi in

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:13,920
my new clear case so the things I'm

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:18,110
using in the raspberry pi r SD card slot

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:22,320
micro USB power I'm using Ethernet and

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm using the USB ports and for now

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,350
that's all I'm using for this project I

00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:34,980
wanted to show a picture of my front

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,170
door and where I'm going to be mounting

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,950
this thing so if you see that little

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:43,560
square hole on top that used to be a

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,990
light so my house was built in 1955

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,550
which is when this was the standard

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,690
design and so the previous owner I think

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,540
did something so it's been a whole

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,950
forever and so that's where I'm going to

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,630
mount it I'm going to show you guys

00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,240
close-up so that's the close-up of that

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,510
hole so but approximately eight by eight

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,550
by six inches and if you look if you can

00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,260
see deep inside there's little the

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,810
circular thing and that's actually the

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,940
power that your light bulb screws in

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:16,040
there so I might have to modify

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:20,850
something there I also for some reason

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:23,490
so I should back up I used to use a nano

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,340
Wi-Fi dongle for this to communicate and

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:29,570
then I used I moved my wireless router

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,610
and for some reason I'm getting a lot of

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:35,580
bounces and so it's been flaky so I need

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,460
to run an Ethernet cable from my right

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,580
order to this tooth blocks so that's

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,910
another to do but anyway this is this is

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,910
where everything's going to get mounted

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:50,280
eventually

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:54,510
so things I had to do to set up the

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:58,410
Raspberry Pi so I I'm using the December

00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:02,220
2012 with you raspbian image I had to

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:05,850
install Pippin PI serial and I'm using

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:09,300
ffmpeg I had to compile it and it took

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,550
about almost three hours to compile and

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:16,470
for some reason my Raspberry Pi got

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:18,240
really really warm and I have a couple

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,860
of other friends who also tried this and

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,690
there's did not get that warm so I don't

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,080
know I don't know what's going on with

00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:28,020
that also had to get the libraries for

00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,090
Dropbox and this is a whole bunch of SDK

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,850
if you have to get to do a lot too and

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,220
then upload and sync the files also the

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:38,520
libraries for the Tullio API is for SMS

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,830
and I wanted to mention the output from

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,230
the Arduino shows up at the dev TTY ACM

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,660
zero for some reason it took me a long

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:54,050
time to find this information so that's

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:56,250
why it's on the slide right demo time so

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:01,130
need a volunteer

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,130
so what's gonna happen is I have

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,150
so what's gonna happen is I'm going to

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,590
get out of my presentation yeah feel

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,750
come yeah you can come in this way

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,250
that's fine I'm gonna get out my

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,520
presentation I'm gonna go to my terminal

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,660
screen and run up into stuff and

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,040
essentially this is the proximity sensor

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:31,000
so image you Frank hi Frank Ruba

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,890
so Frank will walk up slowly to the

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,600
proximity sensor and you will see

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,940
because I'm gonna run my script in in

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,100
the foreground you'll see he's gonna be

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,960
detected I'm going to hold us up so we

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,500
can at least capture his face and you

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,780
know not something else and and then for

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,330
it we'll take a 10-second video an audio

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,610
clip of you and then you'll see it get

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,590
uploaded to Dropbox and then you'll see

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,179
the tweet being sent and then I'll show

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,160
you on my phone that the tweet shows up

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,630
and then we'll click on the URL he'll

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,850
take me to Dropbox and then we'll run

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,750
the video on my phone so that's what

00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,750
we're gonna do

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:22,250
all right so I already logged into my

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:30,800
our PI oh I should talk about the

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:33,850
network connectivity okay

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,560
so what I have right here is I have

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,520
Ethernet running from my Raspberry Pi to

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,080
my Mac and I have it have my Mac just

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,590
handing out a DHCP address to this so

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,800
it's set to when I need to 168 2.2 which

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,780
is what I'm s sh t 2 and so I'm in my PI

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,250
doorbell directory with whole bunch of

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,680
scripts some of some of them work some

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,640
of them don't and so what I'm going to

00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:02,630
do is run a PI doorbell recognizer in

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,090
interactive mode that's I and earlier

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,820
this week when I arrived I was trying to

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,460
get us to work and because the Wi-Fi

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:14,570
issues just it was hideous

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,890
so I put in an additional parameter just

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,440
to keep testing you know different

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:25,310
different timeouts and different latency

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:29,240
values so currently has set to 30 opens

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:31,010
dev TTY ACM 0 on that and it's reading 0

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,860
which is fine which means it hasn't

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:39,020
detected unit 16 feet there's nothing in

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:48,740
16 feet said just let zero so yeah so

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:48,950
Frank's gonna oh all right so come up go

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,010
up

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:56,090
alright cuz all right detected an object

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,170
detected an object so when this turn on

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,820
the light turns green

00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,820
please start talking

00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:18,270
all right say we got that

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,860
so it's uploading to Dropbox and thank

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:24,710
you for I don't know your name for your

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,710
4G phone connection excellent thank God

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,960
thank you Frank

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,720
all right so up there you can see it

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,850
actually showing up on my Dropbox

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,430
account which is behind this one in

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,290
Google Chrome window so I get the URL to

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:53,490
the file name which is that and sending

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:57,890
tweet with the URL and actually I can

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:01,340
let me show you not there

00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,340
eat your hands

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,530
five new tweets okay so that was my old

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:17,530
um but that my old one or not hang on

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:17,530
so what's the URL already go

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,040
that wasn't your okay I wasn't paying

00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,440
attention

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:29,480
okay let's see so I'll show you on here

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,830
and then I'm gonna try to sync up over

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:40,670
here oh I showed up so I don't know if

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:42,320
you can see so it's the proofing I don't

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,270
have my laptop and it's true it showed

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,450
up in my stream over here so I click on

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:49,220
the URL and I have it turned to the

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:54,820
highest volume but I'm gonna put it

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,740
close to my mic as possible oh thank you

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:02,230
hello

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:02,230
alright so play

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:41,820
loading so this is with the 4G well so

00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:48,210
that was that yeah um all right let me

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:52,169
go back to my slide show so that was my

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,519
demo it would be cool to have the video

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,369
you know like a live video stream oh

00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,490
well that's the next step um so anyway

00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:02,100
uh I'm going to now talk quite a bit

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,960
about the code

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,980
maybe I'll skim through how much time do

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:11,460
I have okay I have time okay so the

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,769
Arduino sketch code is really simple

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:18,299
it's you know every second I do a read

00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:22,499
and then send out to to the Arduino um

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:25,379
yeah and then here's the heavy-lifting

00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:28,970
code under PI doorbell recognizer hi

00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:32,330
this is just setting up the serial

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:35,159
reading information from the Arduino

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,499
this is the main thing on this slide is

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,360
max trigger distance which as I

00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,649
mentioned is set to 30 inches so you

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,100
have to come up to at least thirty

00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:50,549
inches or less to be detected and then

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,570
once you're detected as you as you could

00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,950
see I - wait for five valid reads where

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,820
it says detected and object detection

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:02,340
objects and and the actual distance and

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,889
that's my crude debouncing algorithm to

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,929
filter out things like butterflies and

00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:08,429
moths and spiders and everything else

00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:12,419
that wants to crawl in front of the

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:14,140
sensor so that's that's what the valid

00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:18,580
pick threshold is

00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:21,190
is set to 5 and then so if you hit 5

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,460
then it sets up the filename which has a

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,350
date and time stamp so all the the files

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,630
that are uploaded will have the date and

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,330
time stamp so I know exactly when they

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:38,590
showed up and this is the command to

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:42,730
actually take the video clip and key

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:44,590
things here our resolution is 320 240 it

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,810
would devise that video 0 which is 1/2

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:54,580
webcam as I forget what else is AR is

00:25:48,810 --> 00:26:00,190
audio sampling rate in Hertz AC 1 I

00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:04,840
believe is the type at ease ac a be the

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:08,170
- I H w1 is the audio channel whether

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,720
it's mono or stereo and you've got a B

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,270
which is the audio bitrate and in

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,520
kilobits per second and the time limit

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,610
is 10 which is in seconds it's a 10

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:25,120
second capture so f of MPEG is great it

00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:29,620
does a lot of stuff one thing to note is

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:32,650
it doesn't work with all webcams so you

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,910
have to do some filling to see if you

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,810
have a webcam that it doesn't work Lee

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:41,550
you might have to try some other

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:45,160
software ah the Dropbox stuff ok so I

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:49,750
use this Dropbox uploader shell script

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:52,030
to do all the access key exchanges and

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,580
all the Chokin stuff and then to

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,340
actually upload the file and then I call

00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,850
send notifications with the Dropbox URL

00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:04,000
and this is something that I wasn't

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,650
expecting to do I was expecting hey I

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,490
just uploaded the file I can just go to

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:12,760
you know home or the share PI doorbell

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:15,730
blah blah file name right know what

00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,730
Dropbox does is it hashes the name so

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,190
and the full path actually so in order

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,860
to figure out what the URL is to the

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,620
file I had to set up a client session I

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,280
had to use a specific

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:32,280
see I Dropbox client don't share Pat

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,410
yeah to get the metadata for that file

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,260
and then parse the metadata to give the

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:42,170
URL and that's what I sent to my send

00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:46,470
notification stop hi script and that's

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:49,500
essentially the parser where I you is

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,190
for the URL M is for the mode the mode

00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,480
can be either SMS or tweet or all which

00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:01,260
is both the sender's bills and then this

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,540
is the send SMS function where I set up

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,630
the Giulia rest client and then the

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,670
heavy lifting is done by this client SMS

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,400
sent messages they'll create you set you

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,520
put in a phone number and it sends an

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:18,210
SMS to your phone this is great

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,100
and send tweet some initial setup with

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,260
the token keys and you have to actually

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:28,470
do this specifically you have to do this

00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:31,650
verify credentials thing and then do the

00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:37,620
API post update to post a message to

00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:40,500
your account hard-wearing cost one of my

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,800
favorite slides so 22 bucks for the

00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,720
Arduino 16 bucks for the sensor 35 for

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,700
the Raspberry Pi the webcam was from a

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,760
junk pile so I'm not counting it there's

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,440
73 bucks plus you know you add like you

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,690
know power adapter and some Ethernet

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,850
cable and you know some of this stuff

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,610
you can just kill for from stuff lying

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,610
around right but approximately like 100

00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,140
bucks usually less than 100 bucks okay

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,660
you cannot find this kind of

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,210
functionality anywhere for less than

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:12,360
hundred bucks and of course then you can

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:15,480
tweak it then that doesn't happen so

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,500
attributions I bought all my hardware

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,500
from Adafruit calm ffmpeg dot-org was my

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:26,640
go-to site to figure out what parameters

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,429
to use to get it to work Dropbox calm as

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,110
I mentioned for the 82 SDK you have to

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,940
download it and then you know go through

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,179
the steps or do we know that's easy for

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,770
anything Arduino related um your

00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,500
raspberry pi dot org for

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,420
rather if I related adafruit.com also

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,950
has pretty good tutorials for both of

00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,800
these Arduino as well as raspberry PI's

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:50,850
and the comparison chart that I showed

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,280
was from the maker site so I need to

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,620
talk to them about the typo

00:29:53,280 --> 00:30:01,590
I'm using the Python Twitter wrapper

00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:04,830
library to tweet and I didn't use any

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,500
books I just used Google search and

00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:14,400
Stack Overflow and that's all you need

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:15,780
to do so issues in future work so we

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,770
were really lucky today

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:23,040
in this demo where you could actually

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:26,790
hear most of what Frank said I have had

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,610
issues with lip sync where the audio and

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:32,640
the video are off by a significant

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,040
amount so you know I don't know why that

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,930
is it happens sometimes it doesn't

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,490
happen other times I think it's the

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,990
network but maybe it's not the network

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,390
maybe it's you know I don't know

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,280
something else so that's some debugging

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,000
that I need to do to figure out what it

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,100
is to make it a little more reliable

00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,740
let's see as I mentioned - Leo's

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,630
unsupported outside the US so my

00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,040
fallback currently is Twitter but you

00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,040
know what if I have to present somewhere

00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,720
where there's no Twitter you know so

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,900
that's one concern is you know I need to

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,540
have something that's viewable on my

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,560
phone without having to use something

00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:13,410
I'm currently using BeagleBone black

00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:16,260
just came out you know I'm a couple

00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:20,460
months ago I just got one I haven't

00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:25,530
played with it but I really want to use

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,240
it and see if I can maybe remove the

00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,200
Arduino from the picture and just tie it

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:37,800
directly to the BeagleBone black but the

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,900
BBB has only one USB port and I don't

00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,500
know if I can you know if I need to use

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:46,230
the Wi-Fi dongle that I have you know

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,870
the webcam has to use that USB port so I

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:51,470
need another USB port to to use the

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,990
Wi-Fi so not sure

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,419
also the the BBB community is not very

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,840
large and so far not particularly active

00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,390
so it's a concern that you know if I run

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,200
into an issue maybe I won't get the help

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:11,340
to you know solve the problem so that's

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,080
that's the concern Network latency once

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,230
again thank you to them to the gentleman

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,309
who lent me for force you think this is

00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:23,940
a huge issue I don't know if I can find

00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:25,909
a way around it but you I got I got a

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,250
try I got to think of something else

00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:31,559
also we have a new our PI camera module

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,169
let's come out it's available in the UK

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,640
but it's not available in the US yet so

00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,370
I'm waiting for that and once that shows

00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,370
up maybe I can maybe I can remove the

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:45,890
webcam and then I don't need that extra

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:50,610
USB port and so that's another option

00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:53,100
and here's some info on me and you can

00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:56,039
get my source code and slides for this

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,809
talk from my github account I will be

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,360
posting it in August because I'm also

00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:04,740
presenting this at OSCON at the end of

00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:08,490
end of July and so email Twitter a blog

00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:13,549
site and that's pretty much it thank you

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,549
for coming please thank rika-chan

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:22,299
okay thank you Thanks and thank you to

00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:24,549
Scott for lending us the 4G hotspot that

00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:27,100
was much appreciated are there any

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,929
questions for River please come up to

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,929
the microphones which I'm holding one

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,509
thanks very much for that talk two

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:41,559
questions first of which about any

00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:44,230
privacy concerns and the second one

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,960
about with normally for me at home for

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,299
parcel deliveries they rarely ring the

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,779
doorbell at all if they even come up to

00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,429
the doorbell so is there something that

00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:55,720
you might think of like a weight sensor

00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,710
if they're walking up towards there or

00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,090
something like that

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:09,159
oh wait sensor my white sensor huh what

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:11,950
white mass oh oh oh wait okay so the

00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:16,690
first thing privacy concerns um that's a

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:19,119
really dicey area I'm trying to think of

00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,790
ways to circumvent that and that's why I

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,139
was thinking of in Phase three as I

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,000
mentioned I was going to notify the

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,399
person as they walked up saying by the

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,379
way you are going to be on video you

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:39,730
know you know and you will be you know

00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:42,220
record it now so I've also thought of

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,310
like putting a little note or a sign up

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,899
if you know past the 30 inches saying

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,060
you know as he as he approached the door

00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,429
please be aware you know you will be you

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,800
might be I can't see you will be you

00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,030
might be recorded and videoed if you

00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:01,480
have problems with this you know use

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:02,589
this other door kind of thing so the

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,930
weight thing I have not thought about

00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:11,200
that it would be interesting if I could

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,849
do that I also talked of my head so when

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,000
I when I walk up to the front door

00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:19,569
there's tile on the floor it's exposed

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,089
tile so in order to put like weight

00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:25,300
sensors somewhere there maybe under the

00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:26,840
mat or something I would have to run at

00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:32,120
some sort of cable

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,910
right so that might be a problem for me

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,440
because it is exposed cable don't like

00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,750
to be exposed maybe I can use some

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,700
shielding to a certain degree but yeah

00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,700
that's definitely something I could try

00:35:43,900 --> 00:36:00,740
first thing Frank it's a real whirlwind

00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,500
my wife sees it there was a backpack

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,810
while you're talking about using ffmpeg

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,490
to capture the video well the way it was

00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,900
described on the slide was slightly

00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,910
misleading I thought so perhaps you

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:15,350
should look at that so on the slide so

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,420
right back at the beginning when you

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:22,190
first talked about it it said something

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:25,240
which no no no before that

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:29,270
oh right when I was when you take that

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,930
yeah I think I know what you're talking

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,610
about

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:35,570
oh you can go backwards through all my

00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:38,980
slides oh here this one right okay this

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:43,640
is take video clip by clip by sending

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,420
folks yeah that sort of mislead me

00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:51,530
somewhat you know that's it

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:54,290
so and the other thing was that here in

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:57,050
Australia is that know about your room

00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:01,850
true lousine yeah yeah we can't

00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:04,430
guarantee SMS delivery so yeah it's a

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,960
universal problem so I think your

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,950
twitter sounds like a better idea the

00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,290
other two one head would set up the

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:15,020
serial poverty private SSH keys SSH into

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:19,840
a machine so we can send something out

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,840
like on a message or just email emails

00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:30,740
yeah once it works it tends to keep

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:33,250
working yes yeah yeah okay so I've got a

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,110
question about the practicality of it

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,730
Arduino Raspberry Pi how rugged are they

00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,640
in practical terms I mean particularly

00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,319
in Australia you didn't

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,019
we the results of UV problems on a

00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,789
particular on a clear case corroding the

00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:46,380
connections to any corroding the exposed

00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:49,799
was have you got any practical

00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,789
experience with how robust the the whole

00:37:49,799 --> 00:38:02,490
set up is practice I'm looking for my

00:37:53,789 --> 00:38:06,089
door yeah so really good question

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:07,740
Bailey um I haven't played enough with

00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:10,410
this yet because I'm just trying to get

00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:15,269
this thing to work but that is something

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:17,609
a great concern the temperatures in Los

00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:19,559
Gatos can range anywhere from a hundred

00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:23,460
and twenty degrees Fahrenheit which is

00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:27,480
really really hot to twenty degrees

00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:32,369
Fahrenheit which is pretty cold so my

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:37,069
plan was to here in this in this

00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:39,990
enclosure so I'm planning on building

00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,579
like kind of like a plexiglass enclosure

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,930
there's the place called a tech shop

00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:49,400
where you can go and actually build your

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:52,470
own and that's going to be shielded

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:57,930
except for the place where the webcam

00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:00,750
needs a clear view okay so shielding up

00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:03,150
to a certain degree for most of the

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,930
components but I was also thinking of

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:08,490
putting a temperature sensor there and

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,359
somehow funneling some of my air

00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:18,329
conditioning through a doctor that runs

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:20,279
right right yeah so so yeah air

00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,490
conditioning and maybe put in a little

00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:25,559
like the tiniest fan I can think of just

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:29,519
for the hot days and then for cold also

00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:32,309
it's the same duct for heat so I can try

00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,710
to keep a reasonable temperature range

00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:38,309
for all the components otherwise I don't

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:41,160
think it's gonna work well yeah that was

00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:44,089
a great question again thank you again

00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,089
