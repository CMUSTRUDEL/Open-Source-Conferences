Scientists are required to do more and more programming these days,  however they are almost always self-taught. They spend a large percentage of their time wrestling with software, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable. For proficient software developers, particularly those employed to assist these scientists, this computational illiteracy is easy to identify, but much harder to remedy. What d

he is a PhD student in the social of

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,059
Earth school of associate school of

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,340
Earth Sciences at the University of

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,960
Melbourne he is primarily a self-taught

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,639
programmer who discovered software

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
carpentry a few years ago while working

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,350
at the Center for Australian weather and

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,180
climate research he's here to tell us

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,130
all about how software carpentry has

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:31,170
arrived in Australia so please welcome

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:32,610
Damian earthing thanks guys well as

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,579
mentioned this afternoon i'll be talking

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,660
about software carpentry which is a

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,550
volunteer-based organization that

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,879
teaches basic computing skills to

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,739
scientists and so basically i'll start

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,510
by making the case for why we need an

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,820
organization like software carpentry and

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,350
then i'll have a bit of a look at what

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,829
we teach to scientists and how we teach

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,570
it and in particular reference to a

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,680
workshop we held in melbourne earlier

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,719
this year that i was involved in

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,359
organizing and then I finished it

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,770
looking at how you guys might be able to

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,299
get involved in software carpentry

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,250
yourself so I guess the major reason why

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,080
we need software carpentry is because

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,030
graduate scientists so that is

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,500
scientists under graduates who have just

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,409
say completed their bachelor of science

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,930
or something like that and

00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,880
computationally competent and I guess my

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,420
own experience is a perfect example of

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,710
this so I graduated well actually I

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,259
should give you tell what I'm doing

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,670
right now so I am a PhD as was as was

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,890
mentioned at the University of Melbourne

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm looking at climate variability in

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,659
West Antarctica so I'm a meteorologist

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,240
by training but back when I did graduate

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,299
from my undergraduate honors degree in

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,290
2009 fortunately this comic wasn't true

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,640
I was able to find work this is a you

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,770
might not be able to read that text

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,280
anyway but basically when I when I

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,590
graduated I had very little I guess idea

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,869
of just basic software programming

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,939
principles so I done i think in first

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,619
year i did like an intro to scientific

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,649
programming course so i knew what a for

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,990
loop walls and stuff like that i did a

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,390
winter school in the engineering faculty

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,959
i think like was an introduction to to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,590
fortran neither of those courses were

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,300
prerequisite to my degree

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,920
so I was actually well ahead of my peers

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,650
having done any programming whatsoever

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,030
you my undergraduate years and then I

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,220
did my honours year so you spend a year

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,510
doing a research project but as you can

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,500
imagine you've by the time you get the

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,239
course work out of the way you've got

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,980
about six months in and honours year to

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,750
do an entire thesis right the thing up

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,400
and submit so you're not really learning

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,959
how to write good code you just quickly

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,010
hacking other people's codes and make it

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,489
do the things you want it to do to

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,379
quickly get that thesis done so I

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,069
basically walk out the door with my

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,319
bachelor of science honours degree with

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:49,530
no idea about issue tracking or version

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,390
control or writing maintainable programs

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,640
in a systematic way I basically

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,140
completely ignorant of any of the tools

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,200
and techniques that are just standard

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,599
practice in the software industry and so

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,790
I walk into my new job at CSIRO as the

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,680
climate projections scientist and I get

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,269
given the keys to one of the

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,950
supercomputers at the National computing

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,840
infrastructure in Canberra I got

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,019
multiple terabytes of climate model

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,959
dad's look at you know my boss says go

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:18,959
and not surprisingly in those first

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,970
months at CSR on competitively

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,350
inefficient you know I'm taking me weeks

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,569
to do things that should take minutes

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm reinventing wheels I'm struggling to

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,440
collaborate with people and all the

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,940
while I'm contributing to a fairly

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,819
high-profile project that has really

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,459
tight deadlines in a field of science is

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,139
that is highly politicized and any

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,299
mistakes that are made are really seized

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,579
upon by skeptics in the community so

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,769
it's obviously isn't an ideal situation

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,630
but I'm certainly not the only one that

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,180
happens to in all fields of science

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,579
whether it be like astronomy ecology

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,049
medical science you name it graduates

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:53,940
are coming out they really have no idea

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,709
or even the basics of programming and

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,389
then they've just got these mountains of

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,380
data to analyze so that's why we need

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,790
software carpentry and I guess the

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,250
obvious question is why aren't these

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,660
scientists computationally competent

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,489
when they graduate there's probably

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,569
three major reasons the first is that

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,750
there's just no room in the curriculum

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,430
so most university lecturers if you talk

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,079
to them they would agree that it would

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,479
be nice to teach some programming in

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
undergraduate degrees but they just

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,479
can't find the room there isn't I mean

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,219
what do you take out of the meteorology

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,659
degree do you take out you know theories

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,250
of thunderstorm development or the

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,180
greenhouse effect or there's a rule like

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,650
really

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,660
fundamental things that meteorologists

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,060
need to know so it's just impossible to

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,669
find room the second is that there's no

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,710
kind of standards I mean granting

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,039
agencies and scientific journals and

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,620
stuff they don't really expect the same

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,539
standards of computational work as they

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,479
do for other experimental work so

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,370
there's no big stick telling scientists

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,229
to lift their game when it comes to

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,759
programming and it's also a little bit

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,610
of a case of the blind leading the blind

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,889
so computing has come a very long way in

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,300
a very short space of time so senior

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,340
lecturers at university you probably

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,110
don't know the things that need to be

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,509
taught to the undergraduates so that

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:11,880
doesn't help either okay so they're not

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,650
computationally composite why is it a

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,169
massive problem there's probably two

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,539
made major reasons the first relates to

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:20,370
efficiency a little bit like my my

00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,960
struggles when I first arrived at CSIRO

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,150
and if you think about a problem and I

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,500
guess the solving power you have to

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,130
solve that problem there's probably

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,139
three corners on the triangle so you're

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,900
solving power depends firstly on I guess

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,340
machine speed and algorithm speed but

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,080
both those things have sped up

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,780
astronomically in the last you know

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,880
decade or so so you know a simulation

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,680
that took a year to run you know 10 or

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,800
15 years ago you can probably run in a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,389
minute these days so you've had like you

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
know orders of magnitude increase in

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,930
both those factors but in terms of

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,570
development time the time it takes to

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,830
actually write the code there is some

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,419
work out there that shows that that has

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,250
improved with scientists a little bit

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,620
but we're talking small percentage

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,360
increases not orders of magnitude and so

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,310
the bottom line really is that for

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
scientists today getting their code to

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,639
do the right thing is actually a bigger

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,470
bottle neck than its running time so

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,889
that's one reason why computational

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,690
compensate competency is so important

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,669
the other reason relates to transparency

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,620
so many of you might be aware that

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,139
there's been a strong push in science in

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,500
recent years to make science more open

00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,580
and transparent and one of the one of

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,960
the topics that comes up when you're

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,300
talking about these things is the

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,949
reproducibility of published science so

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,770
if you go to a scientific journal and

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,990
you read a paper in that journal the

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,400
theory basically says that someone

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,870
working the field should be able to take

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
your paper and just going on the

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,290
information that they've

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,250
in that paper they should be able to

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,990
reproduce your results all right and

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,310
that's not always the case and so nature

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,560
which is probably the most famous

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,510
general in the sciences published the

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,950
whole heap of a whole series of articles

00:06:53,510 --> 00:07:00,170
in 2012 on the ear reproducibility of

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:03,860
the science that they publish and it

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:07,760
culminated in some quite major changes

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,620
to the checklist that reset so if you're

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,910
given a paper if you're a researcher and

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,320
you get sent a paper from nature to

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,670
review you have to go through this

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,250
checklist and one of the items on the

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,980
checklist now says did the author submit

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,900
their code their source code to you as

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,240
the reviewer or did they upload it to

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,190
some kind of public repository so it can

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,960
be viewed and so that's a that's a major

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,960
change and you can certainly imagine

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,690
that in 10 or 20 years time that'll

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,560
trickle down and basically all

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,690
scientific journals that have anything

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,670
to do with computing will be basically

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,100
demanding that authors provide their

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,340
source code and in fact we've already

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,480
seen websites like run my code pop up

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,740
recently we're basically scientists can

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,150
provide their code up on the site like

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,220
that and actually people can log into

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,030
the site and actually execute that code

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,560
on the author's data in the cloud or

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,150
people can even upload their own data

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,740
and execute the authors code on their

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,320
own data so that's that's a really cool

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,580
thing and so basically the graduates of

00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,930
today when they're doing the bulk of

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,400
their research and the bulk of their

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,990
writing papers in 10 or 20 years from

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,980
now it's almost a sure thing that

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,300
they're going to have to be submitting

00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,520
their code like this and making a

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,550
publicly available which is terrifying

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,530
for most scientists today and that's the

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,430
other reason why this computational

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,370
competency is so important okay so

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,060
hopefully I've convinced you that

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,230
software carpentry I'm sorry that

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,880
computational conferences is a problem

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,070
for scientists the question is well how

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,930
do we fix that I mean what should we be

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,190
teaching scientists when should we be

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,440
teaching it to them in how should we be

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,300
teaching it to them and fortunately

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,650
software carpentry has been working on

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,630
the answer to these questions since the

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,220
late 90s and we've heard a few

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,260
references to Greg Wilson today so he

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,780
was the the founder of software

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,649
carpentry he's a Canadian programmer and

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,290
basically

00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,869
back in 95 96 he wrote a series of

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,399
papers titled what should computer

00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:03,259
scientists teach to physical scientists

00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,970
and engineers and the papers were really

00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,829
born out of his frustration working with

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,329
physicists who wanted to do pretty

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,490
complex things with computers but really

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:13,189
didn't have even an idea of the basics

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,290
and in response to his papers he got

00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,999
invited by the director of the Advanced

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,589
Computing of olive tree at the Los

00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,589
Alamos National Laboratory in the u.s.

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:25,100
to run some courses for the physicists

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:27,829
at that lab and so over for four year

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,119
period around nine one week courses and

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,949
then he got a job elsewhere and and

00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:33,290
moved off and and that was that but i

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,300
think that the major learning point from

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,220
what I'd call it eration one of software

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,809
carpentry was that a week was too long

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,999
these a lot of the scientists just

00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,139
didn't have a full week to commit they

00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,309
were fried by the end of the week

00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,339
because it was just so much new

00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:48,319
information on top of them so that was

00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,790
probably the learning point there the

00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,619
second iteration of software carpentry

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,779
happened in two thousand four or five

00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:56,119
where Greg and some others actually got

00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,429
a grant from the path the path and the

00:09:56,119 --> 00:10:00,829
software foundation to put all their

00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:02,839
teaching materials up online and to make

00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:05,749
them freely available probably a little

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,399
bit like universities these days have

00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:09,199
their OpenCourseWare where you can go

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,939
and basically view all the teaching

00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:15,470
materials for free I think that we're

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,870
hoping that then there'd be a bit of an

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,309
explosion in the teaching of basic

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,809
programming trying to graduates because

00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,759
it would be easy to teach all the

00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:24,499
materials are freely available teachers

00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,600
would be providing new material and it'd

00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,399
be constantly updated but it never

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,379
really took off and I think that's where

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,759
those core group of people that started

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,360
software carpentry started to realize

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,549
that at least in the foreseeable future

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,009
is not going to be that full scale

00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,929
teaching of programming to scientists at

00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:44,600
an undergraduate level just because this

00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,639
there isn't room in the curriculum and

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,290
then so the third iteration happened in

00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,499
2010 they managed to cobble together

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,079
about funding from about 12 different

00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:55,970
organizations and they recorded a

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,309
hundred and twenty short video lessons

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,499
that they put up online and ran three

00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,449
online classes so a little bit like if

00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:04,220
anyone's heard of MOOCs these days that

00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:05,720
the massive open online courses that

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,260
universities are running was kind of

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,960
like one of them

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:14,560
but the major problem was today's MOOCs

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,420
gets hundreds of thousands of people

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,580
registering for their courses so when

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,560
completion rates are as low was about 5%

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,240
of these courses it doesn't matter so

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,330
much because five percent of 100,000

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,010
still a very big number but obviously

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,390
these courses didn't have quite as big a

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,220
profile as that and so when you only

00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,190
have hundreds of applicants five percent

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,630
of that is not many people so kind of

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,670
the learning point there was they needed

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,200
an in-person model this this online

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,700
model wasn't really capturing people

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,370
that needed to be teaching it in person

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,750
but the model needed to be scalable so

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,040
that lots of different people could be

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,270
teaching just because it was it's

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,800
obviously too much work and you're not

00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,410
going to reach many scientists with just

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,760
one teacher and sustainable from a

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,790
financial viewpoint as well would have

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,920
been nice so that's where the fourth

00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,190
iteration came in cited in January last

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,680
year and this time they called these the

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,450
short two day workshops are boot camps

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,820
software carpentry boot camps now based

00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:10,090
on a group called the hacker within

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,710
which is a grassroots group of graduate

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,660
students at the University of Wisconsin

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,590
in the state's basically grad students

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,020
teaching software carpentry or basic

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:23,080
computing skills to other grad students

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,530
and so the audience for these boot camps

00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,550
was typically 40 or 50 people and

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,170
importantly they were graduate students

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,850
so they have a bit more time than

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,620
undergraduates which is nice and they

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,790
also have the motivation because they've

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,960
got a project that they're actually

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,340
working on a problem that they're

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,600
working on and now they've suddenly

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,020
realized that they really need to know

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,150
this stuff and the usual teaching model

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,100
is you normally have two extras over the

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,260
two days kind of alternating and five

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,410
kind of helpers roaming around helping

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,390
people with issues as they go and this

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,460
this fourth iteration really I guess

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,260
exploded in popularity and over the

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,170
period january two thousand twelve to

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,120
july this year there's been 92 boot

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,280
counts worldwide and reached over three

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,940
thousand scientists and there's a whole

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,200
heap of like really prestigious

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,480
institutions in there like in Oxford

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,130
Harvard Stanford you name it it's a it's

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,000
a whose whose list of places where

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:19,240
they've taught and so what we did was

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,339
that we got Greg Wilson to come out

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,230
in February this year to Australia to

00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,870
host the first boot camps outside of

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,560
north america in the u.s. sorry North

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,750
America and Europe and he did a first

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,000
did a boot camp at the genes to

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,589
Geoscience research center Macquarie in

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,180
Sydney and then he came down to

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:38,770
Melbourne and after the Australian

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,170
meteorological and oceanographic Society

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,089
conference that we had in February a lot

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,100
of the people of that conference stayed

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,459
on for an extra two days seventy people

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,899
in fact stayed on to do a boot camp at

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,080
the University of Melbourne and that was

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,760
the one I was in organized with some

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,730
people from the IRC centre of excellence

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,910
for climate system science and already

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,370
we've got brisbane and adelaide booked

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,649
in for boot camps with the

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,750
bioinformatics community in September

00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,950
this year in brisbane and adelaide we're

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,810
thinking of having another one down here

00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,350
in hobart for the amos conference next

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:17,350
year and pretty certain there will be

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,120
boot camps again mostly for biology and

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,680
bioinformatics people in melbourne

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,300
sydney and canberra before the end of

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,730
this year so that's software carpentry

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,740
in a nutshell and how it came about but

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,350
what do we actually teach to scientists

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,529
at these boot camps and this is I guess

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,470
what we think is the perfect outline for

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,600
a boot camp for weather / climate

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,399
scientists so the content varies a

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,860
little bit depending on the audience but

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,149
this is what we think is best for that

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,000
audience and it doesn't vary that much

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:53,339
between boot camp and so I guess first

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,980
up there's like a pre boot camp I guess

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,390
warm up that people can do watching some

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,459
of the online videos that they developed

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,290
back in 2010 on the UNIX shell on things

00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,649
and this is stuff as simple as we

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:08,290
basically teach them 12 or so basic unix

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,690
commands with the i guess the intention

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,740
of just getting the concept across of

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,360
you know using single purpose of joining

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,770
single purpose functions using like

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,839
filters and pipes and things like that

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,360
and just getting the computer to repeat

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,490
things for you using loops and no

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,860
history and things like that and that I

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,300
mean the weather and climate science

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,829
community probably has a little bit of a

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,959
higher base level of knowledge than most

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,460
other communities like say the medical

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,680
community

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,660
like that so not many people needed this

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,970
warmer activity but in some of those

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,820
other boot camps that just that simple

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,440
unique stuff comes out in the question

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,090
is is something people find really

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,620
valuable so that's I guess the really

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,120
low level that we're talking about with

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,320
a lot of graduates and its really

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,210
starting from from scratch so day one at

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,890
our weather and climate science boot

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,860
camp the theme is programming like a

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,070
programmer basically and we teach in

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,590
Python because it's free it's intuitive

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,000
and so we have to obviously give a bit

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,710
of an intro to the syntax and all those

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,330
types of things but really the purpose

00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,060
of the first day is talking about

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,580
program design and testing so how to you

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,190
know grow a program i get incrementally

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,550
as a series or a set of you know

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,510
comprehensible reusable functions so a

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,670
lot of the stuff that the previous

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,830
speaker was talking about actually so

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,870
that takes a lot of day one and then day

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,000
two I guess the theme is keeping track

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,020
of your stuff so we introduced version

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,860
control we teach kind svn or gears

00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,750
depending on really the lecturers

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,340
preference there's a lot of debate

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,810
amongst the tutors about which one we

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,250
should be teaching but I don't think it

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,400
really matters they both essentially do

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,950
the same thing and then data management

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,510
izle is another thing that a lot of a

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,920
lot of the question is are picking up

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,360
the people want a lot of help with with

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,940
they've got so much data and they just

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,470
want help managing it now this is this

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,210
is a really good thing to teach in the

00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,680
weather and climate sciences because as

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,290
a profession we've pretty much settled

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,480
on a common file format so we use netcdf

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,550
for network common data form and there's

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,500
a whole climate and for forecasting

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,380
metadata convention that goes with using

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,089
those types of files in our area so

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,040
there's a lot of stuff we can teach but

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,930
to a more general audience it's a little

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,640
more tricky and besides telling people

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,000
you know have a sensible directory

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,810
structure and use sensible file names

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,459
it's a little bit difficult to know

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,900
exactly what to teach and what you can

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,670
teach to a generic audience so that's

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,010
that's something that I guess software

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,530
carpentry trying to answer as we speak

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,690
and then that content typically doesn't

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,500
take the entire two days so we also fit

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,420
in some kind of self-contained units

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,370
that are most relevant to the audience

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,450
that we've got so we might look at numpy

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,480
if they're doing a lot of numerical

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,440
stuff regular expressions databases or

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,259
even just have someone

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,379
come in and give a demo of someone who

00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,970
has really good programming practices in

00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:56,070
that area of science that come in and

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,450
just do a demo of how they used the

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,620
principles of software carpentry and

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:05,070
their daily work so that's what we teach

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,659
for how do we teach it there's a big

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,950
emphasis in if anyone was in the room

00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:12,570
this morning for the Python 102 session

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,399
really a lot like that in terms of all

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,019
live coding so i'm not using slides

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,580
basically at all it's all just live

00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,159
coding because people seem to learn a

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,740
lot more when you actually or they seem

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,830
to learn a lot just from watching you do

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,909
it basically and it's also kind of

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,710
exciting because you're waiting for them

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,110
to make a mistake and all those kind of

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,690
things we have an emphasis i guess i'm

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,399
free and open source tools because we

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,190
want people to leave so that the

00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,000
participants come with their laptops

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,139
hopefully everything is installed before

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,299
hand otherwise we help them with that

00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:44,220
and so everything is on their laptop

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,750
ready to go so when they leave and go

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,909
back to their lab go back to their desk

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,379
they basically have no excuse but to

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,669
just start using what we've been

00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,909
teaching because it's all set up and

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,350
ready to go on their machine most of our

00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:56,879
teachers and helpers are either

00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,039
scientists themselves or they spend a

00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:01,139
lot of time working with scientists so

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,659
that really helps they have a very good

00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,710
idea of what scientists need to know and

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:08,480
probably more importantly what they

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,889
don't need to know to get the job done

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,929
we use a I don't know if anyone's seen

00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,370
etherpad there's a bit of a screen

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,450
capture over here it's basically a

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:20,070
website where we use a fair bit for just

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,809
like cutting and pasting sections of

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,399
code interesting bits and pieces and

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:24,750
then everyone has that up on their

00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,950
browser seeing there with their laptops

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,509
and they can cut and paste into their

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,240
script and all those kinds of things and

00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,620
they can they can post comments and

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,850
things and so that's actually a really

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,889
useful tool that we use sticky notes is

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,210
another cool thing that Greg Wilson

00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:41,250
really likes where you can see this guy

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,870
here he's got a green post-it note on

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,159
the lid of his laptop which means things

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,899
are going perfectly he doesn't need any

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,090
help but as soon as he runs into trouble

00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:49,470
you're whack a pink or red sticky note

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,700
up on the lid of your laptop and one of

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,590
the one of the helpers comes around and

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,149
helps you out just quietly on the side

00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,610
while the class goes on that really just

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,670
helps with I guess things

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,890
smoothly throughout the day there's a

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,870
big emphasis on pair programming or

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,880
working on lots of hands-on exercises in

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,260
pairs because that's a little bit like

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,580
you know code reviews and everything

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,490
that works so good when you've got other

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,530
people looking at your code and stuff so

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,570
there's a lot of working in pairs and

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,700
there's also actually software carpentry

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,070
offers a teacher training course so it's

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,870
takes about 12 weeks and you have to

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,240
give about two to four hours of your

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,580
time and it basically teaches would be

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,010
instructors a lot of basics of you know

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,630
educational psychology and all these

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,640
kind of teaching principles as they

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,260
relate to teaching programming so

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,000
there's like a bit of a baseline of

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,500
skill and knowledge when it comes to

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,929
teaching and there's a bit of a quality

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,520
control on the people who are teaching

00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:49,799
software carpentry boot camps okay so

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,230
that's that's what we teach and I mean

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,059
92 boot camps in in 18 months is pretty

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,010
impressive but it hasn't been without

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:58,799
its challenges obviously and so these

00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,440
are probably the main for the first

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,380
challenge is is that I guess no matter

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,580
how fast or how slowly you teach things

00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,380
you always end up with about twenty

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,700
percent of the audience that is kind of

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,500
overwhelmed and it's too much for them

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,110
another twenty percent it's just too

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,150
easy they're bored so what do you do and

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,250
greg's tried a lot of like pre bootcamp

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,700
questionnaires but people seem to be

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,580
notoriously bad at self assessing how

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,660
good they are these things another thing

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,250
you could do I guess is a bit of a

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,020
proficiency test for people before they

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,480
come along with that has tended to scare

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,460
people off a bit so the best thing

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,740
they've found is having a cohort of

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,790
people who have a similar background so

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,010
they're all weather and climate

00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,600
scientists awww they're all biologists

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,130
awww they're all at colleges to whatever

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,610
they are that that tends to help a lot

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,140
with having a fairly level playing field

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,350
when it comes to the knowledge of the

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,110
audience proving that we're helping is

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,970
another difficult thing we're saying to

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,240
do post boot camp questionnaires and

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,400
things but how you quantify it like the

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,840
productivity of a program i'll let alone

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,160
the productivity of a scientist and

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,270
whether you've improved that because of

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,669
the course you gave them so that's

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,460
that's a tricky thing that software

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,920
carpentry is still grappling with

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,930
software installation is still

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,460
also a massive problem and I mean it's a

00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,780
problem for people who are really

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,090
experienced in this stuff so it's

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,040
obviously a nightmare for beginners in

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,300
Melbourne the big the great thing we had

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,860
because we had the conference 23 days

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,630
beforehand people could come to a help

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,400
desk during that conference and get

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,140
assistance with their their installation

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,810
and stuff but that continues to be a

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,840
nightmare for most boot camps and

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,520
related to that text editors funnily

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,630
enough seem to be a bit of an issue so I

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,490
mean we don't really want to be

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,460
encouraging people to use naive editors

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,740
like notepad but the kind of the legacy

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,590
UNIX editors like VI and emacs a kind of

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:51,260
a nightmare when it comes to beginners

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,370
so that's that's a problem as well and I

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,640
guess the last challenge has been

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,050
follow-up so we'd only just leave these

00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,030
people cold when they finished a boot

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,250
camp so what do we do to give to

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,870
continue to help them out and one of the

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,140
things we've been doing and why I've got

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:08,570
the etherpad screen capture up here is

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,970
they offer online office hours for say a

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,080
22 hour period every week where some of

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,660
the tudors make themselves available

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,780
online and the participants basically

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,130
log into etherpad typing their problem

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,440
and then one of the tutors goes yep I

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,180
know a bit about that area and then the

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,910
tutor will go off with that student and

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,530
now open another private etherpad page

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,750
or they do some kind of desktop sharing

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,430
arrangement or something so like that

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,120
student can get some help with their

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,500
programming and the people who have

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,630
participated in that have really loved

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,590
it I mean it's pretty rare that you get

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,880
such one-on-one feedback but there

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,080
hasn't been a lot of people walking in

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,580
and I don't know whether they just don't

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,050
think there is such a thing as a free

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,140
lunch which it is a free lunch in this

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:53,360
case but that continues to be a

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:58,280
challenge is just getting people to to

00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,440
actually log in just for starters so

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,180
last bit of the talk is how you might be

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,770
able to get involved and I guess there's

00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,960
probably four ways so you can obviously

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,520
if you're a scientist in the room you

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,440
can participate in a boot camp and on

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,410
the on the website there's a list of all

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,510
the upcoming boot camps around the world

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,590
you can organize one for your

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,210
institution or group and that's what I

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,310
did I mean I i found the software

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,140
carpentry boot camp software commerce

00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,450
your website really useful so i just

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,370
contacted the info email address and

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,509
basically asked greg if you want to come

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,389
out to Australia and you said yes

00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:31,070
so that's a really good thing they have

00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:34,070
a lot of support for you if you want to

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,479
organize one yourself teaching is also

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,539
an option if you're someone who helps a

00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:39,649
lot of scientists and would like to see

00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,570
the level of their knowledge improved

00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:43,489
and obviously there's a teacher training

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,440
course and all sorts of support for

00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,729
teachers or you can just browse the

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,979
teaching materials if you're interested

00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:50,629
I mean on the software carpentry github

00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:52,489
page all the teaching materials are

00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:55,039
available under a Creative Commons

00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:59,059
license so it's a really wonderful

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,859
resource so in summary the low

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,839
computational competency of graduate

00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,489
scientists is really causing them to

00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,039
struggle in today's research environment

00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:08,719
of big data and open science but

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,979
software carpentry has been working on

00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:12,019
this problem for a while now and use

00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:15,619
here to help so it please get involved

00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:19,729
in any way you can and I've got up here

00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:22,279
just to finish a paper up on archive

00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:26,149
that's a group of the software carpentry

00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,440
tutors have written should be published

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,269
in the Proceedings of the National

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,159
Academy of Sciences fairly soon but

00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:34,249
basically summarizes in a really nice

00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,029
paper what it is that they teach so if

00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:36,319
you're particularly if you're a

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:38,599
scientist that's a really good paper to

00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,299
read and my details are up there as well

00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,559
I write a blog on research best practice

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,629
in weather and climate science and I

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,039
tweet on the same topic so there my

00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:48,039
details there as well thanks

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,950
Christian ship or do we yeah sorry

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:10,960
thanks for your talk that looks like a

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,660
really interesting program a set of set

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,000
of materials do you know if they have

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,180
considered using the ipython notebook

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,970
instead of the other pad it seems like

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,710
setting up a notebook that everyone can

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,950
that would be another good way that you

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,590
could share snippets and have live demos

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,210
and that kind of thing yeah they um I

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,130
mean I know they want to and they really

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,350
want to transition to that but I think

00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,670
they've had install problems has been

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,680
the major thing that's been holding them

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,940
back and as soon as they get those

00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,700
things sorted I think they'll make the

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,620
switch and they'll be using notepad yeah

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,030
straight away but yeah it's been plagued

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,030
by install problems from what I've heard

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,760
yeah they end up from I can gather they

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:11,030
end up suggesting a range of open source

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,240
or near open text editors to use but it

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,320
just it just seems to be the from the

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,970
feedback I've been getting from all the

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,530
teachers that they get there and just

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,480
just getting people using the text

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,130
editor in the very first exercise is

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,500
like a real challenge even after they've

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,610
made those suggestions it's just one of

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,289
those things that yeah I mean I haven't

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,789
settled on one that they think is best

00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:37,400
there's just they suggest a suite at the

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:39,679
moment yeah yeah to one of the things

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,049
that seems to me to be the case is that

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,700
this science community has a pretty

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,130
ingrained set of you know conferences

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,600
and like an academic you know schedule

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,120
for the year that they're engaged with

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,909
and there's not a big crossover with the

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,309
with software conferences and software

00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:56,900
activities just in general so sometimes

00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,159
seems like a problem of never the two

00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,659
shall meet because you can't get

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,400
accepted into the science conference

00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,809
because you don't have a paper because

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,730
you come from an IT background and

00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,320
you're presenting results but the IT

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,980
conferences are not of sufficient value

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,929
to the scientist because of the time

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,299
input required and the limited content

00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:17,000
that's relevant to them is there a way

00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:19,220
you can see for there yeah you're right

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,320
that is a tricky one man yeah if you

00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,909
were a if you had a software background

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,320
and you submit an abstract there

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,510
wouldn't really be a session for you in

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,299
most conferences so I mean I've

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,580
suggested I think I mean when I

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,049
suggested to the Australian

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,059
meteorological and oceanographic society

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:38,150
conference that we have Greg come and

00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:39,620
speak as a keynote at our conference and

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,840
do the boot camp after they were really

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,610
supportive of it I think I think people

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,020
realize that there's a problem and if

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,730
you tell to a scientist that in 10 years

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,289
time we can add to or even less you have

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,600
to be giving your code to a journal they

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:53,419
tend to like panic and so there's a

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,590
general feeling that they need to lift

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,500
their game and they just don't know how

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:59,240
site I think if you were to suggest to

00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,530
conference organizers and just approach

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,539
to say can we have a special session

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,340
just on computing in this area of

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,830
science that that would go for it and if

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,890
you could if you could pitch a really

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,300
cool session it

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,300
really well supported I think yeah

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:27,220
have you got any acknowledgments in any

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:29,320
papers that your your group has sort of

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,090
helped the the authors with the software

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,509
behind it that that might be some some

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,850
way of looking at the impact that you're

00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:38,259
having yeah actually that that's a good

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,980
thought I haven't I mean there isn't

00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:43,539
anything on the website that I know of

00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,070
you're right a lot of even Python

00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:46,419
packages and stuff there's at least on

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,950
their side they say if you use the our

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,330
staff acknowledge us please yeah there

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,360
is that's a good idea actually I might

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,039
suggest that to them yeah because that

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,809
that would be one way of proving that

00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,559
you're helping women here yeah that's

00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,559
good suggestion

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,159
debuggers do you address debuggers at

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,270
all yeah in the you know I guess the

00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,340
first day when we're talking about

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,470
programming like programmer we introduce

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,640
using like PDB in kind of you know

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,309
stepping through your code and stuff

00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,539
like that and I mean most well pretty

00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,559
much all the audience of scientists

00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,929
would never have seen something like

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,220
that that they're all just you know

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,630
editing the code putting in a print

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,279
statement and then running it and then

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,669
changing where they put the print so

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,049
that that tends to be a well one of a

00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,919
hundred of things like version control

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,240
and all these things a bit of a

00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:41,950
mind-blowing thing there whether like oh

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,020
my god this such an easier way to do

00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:48,419
these things so yeah I'm just the very

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,419
basics with PDB we're usually introduced

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,600
unfortunately afternoon tea is upon us

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,220
so if you have any more questions I'm

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,230
sure daylian will be around the

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,480
conference in the meantime I'm sure

00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,029
you'll all join me in thanking Damien

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,679
for his awesome talk we have pike on
