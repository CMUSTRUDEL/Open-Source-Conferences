Social app development challenges us to code for users' personal world. Users are giving push-back to ill-fitted assumptions about their own identity â€” name, gender, sexual orientation, important relationships, and many other attributes that are individually meaningful.

How can we balance users' realities with an app's business requirements?

Facebook, Google+, and others are struggling with these questions. Resilient approach

so you heard a lot of rails in that

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,710
introduction and I apologize there's not

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,460
much Python and there's zero rails in

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,389
this so I think we're going to be okay

00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,059
so interesting thing happened this

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,609
morning my presentation which is 45

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,529
minutes disappeared completely so I gave

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,119
this talk in a much shorter version in

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,310
Melbourne a few months ago and we're

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,269
going to use that version which means

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,890
that we're going to free up a whole

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,800
bunch of time for Q&A afterwards it

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,990
happens that I love QA and I have a lot

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,130
of stuff stuck in my head and I hope

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,719
that you guys will have lots of

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,390
questions so we can use that time really

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,370
well so let us begin so in addition to

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,370
being that developer i'm also a sex

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,469
educator and i think a lot about how

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:53,309
these two things inter lap and they do

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:54,780
quite a lot imagine walking through the

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,629
world knowing that everyone's first

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,760
assumptions about how you see yourself

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:02,609
who you love what feels right for you

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,140
that they're all completely wrong now

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,840
imagine signing up for a cool website

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,030
and then being required to select an

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,830
option from a drop-down menu that

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,490
doesn't include anything that represents

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,229
you at all you'll feel defeated you'll

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,759
want to argue that whatever they think

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,689
they're learning from that drop-down

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,130
menu it's not really true you'll want to

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,430
tell them that they're adding to your

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,320
humiliation by making you do this you'll

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,880
want to tell them that they're missing a

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,880
huge part of you

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,700
ok

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,380
so users are giving push back to

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,780
assumptions that leave them out and

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,229
social apps in particular have been

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,090
pressed to adjust Facebook Google others

00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,369
they're all dealing with these questions

00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,130
and have been for many years and they're

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,899
still working it out so if you feel out

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,820
of depth with these questions you're not

00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:08,110
alone so we're going to look at how you

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,179
can deal with that we've got this idea

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,660
that normalization of data is just the

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,880
bestest thing ever which works out fine

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,799
if all you want our users who are among

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,860
that little elite who belong to your

00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:22,540
idealized norm that you're seeking but

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,180
most of us in fact are going for a much

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,290
broader user based on that right we want

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,000
everyone to participate enjoy so when

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,880
the objectives of database normalization

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,769
is to mirror real world concepts and

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,230
their interrelationships this is one of

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,690
the core precepts of normalization and

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,700
when that database is in tension with

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,470
the real world then it's not the user

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,880
who's the one that has to change it's us

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,079
so why is this stuff so hard is because

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,390
at first glance it looks so easy so

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,489
we're fooled we think it's just forms

00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:00,160
right and we've done that a million

00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:03,430
times before so we get tripped up with

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,560
some flawed premises first that things

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,570
that are deeply personal about humans

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,609
can be reduced to lists second that our

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,160
assumptions are that canonical lists

00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:20,290
with these things do exist or at least

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,269
surely they can be created and the third

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,640
is our faith that the first two problems

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,540
here can easily be solved by just adding

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,540
more list items

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:39,129
hang on we'll get there any minute this

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,510
is a real list this is British Airways

00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:44,959
they don't do this anymore now they're

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,370
down to like 20 and you notice how they

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,170
had to solve this by putting the first

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,489
couple of ones over again because they

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,409
realize people were getting to the end

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,680
and just wanted to have you know like

00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:56,870
mr. mrs. whatever doctor let's keep this

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,329
simple so they knew in their hearts that

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,260
more list items wasn't the solution and

00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:06,260
they did it anyway so we know that this

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:11,420
is not going to work and it really risks

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,250
making us look foolish so that next

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,739
flawed premise is that we intuitively

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,900
understand the nature of social networks

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,109
that we understand that definition and

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,180
when we step aside from that term that's

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,520
been implemented as a technology and

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,370
just think about the human concept what

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,200
is a social network what do we mean by

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,470
that well in real life it's our apps

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,080
being personal replicating and building

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,440
upon who we are how we relate to each

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,510
other what our social world is the bonds

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,300
that we create and want to maintain its

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,389
all that one-on-one stuff and as

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,099
personal as our social lives get so in

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:57,199
social identity is a dependency itself

00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,410
so this developers we build or we break

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,880
that community with each line of code

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,610
what one-to-one relationships are we

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,940
fostering what relationships are we

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:13,510
inhibiting between our app between

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:16,660
ourselves between users in real life I

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:22,930
know your personhood better than you do

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:28,060
sounds so presumptuous right we do that

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:31,849
in real life who you are is invalid

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:36,860
sounds arrogant we do validations all

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:39,830
the time in real life your existence

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,370
isn't possible sounds pretty clueless it

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:50,729
ignores the obvious that you

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:53,430
are this is not what we set out to do

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:55,590
it's not the user experience that we

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,199
want to give it's not the community that

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,960
we're seeking to build we want to create

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,550
things that feel cutting-edge not that

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,620
seemed out of touch postelles law tells

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,419
us be conservative in what you do and be

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,610
liberal and what you accept from others

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:17,550
so how do we bring reality into the data

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:22,289
views our logic that's by starting at

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,880
schema as developers we get tugged in

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:26,039
these two different directions we want

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,289
to keep the codebase manageable but we

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:33,389
also need to design for reality

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,979
complexity the messiness of humans so we

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,990
have to get schemas into alignment and

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,330
when I say schemas I mean there's two

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,130
different kinds when does our mental

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,960
schema it's a psychological and

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,450
philosophical idea it's a belief system

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,030
about how the world works and it's

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,729
personal it's our set of preconceived

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,979
ideas and it's our mental framework for

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,300
representing whatever aspect of the

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,349
world we're trying to model in a

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,610
database it's our personal filter and

00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:03,180
this has the limitations of the

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,760
individual creating it whereas database

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,490
schemas are basically just the same

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,400
thing manifest into SQL or whatever

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,770
you're using it's just taking that idea

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,370
that belief system and imprinting it on

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,400
a database so here are some different

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,000
front-end manifestations of individuals

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:29,340
of and schemas I've got a lot of

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,930
variation schemas can be a foundation

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:37,370
for expressing things that are deeply

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:41,639
intimate self-image our identity our

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:46,260
important relationships our sense of

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:50,270
values and even our spirit our

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,250
creativeness are very uniqueness

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:57,570
and by all that they're defining our

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,100
user experience and this the schemas

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,530
that are leaving behind that user

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,950
experience but that's the part that we

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,680
can fix I ask more questions like what

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,020
benefit will be user notice not letting

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
ourselves off the hook by saying what

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,660
will be great how is this feature going

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,460
to be awesome and serve them well

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,260
because that's coming from our bias they

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,100
really need to think in terms of what

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,080
they're getting out of it so we can

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,690
evaluate that user perspective from a

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,110
couple of different angles and that will

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,400
give us some focus for making decisions

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,870
there's no point on this chart where

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,419
everybody is going to see maximum

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,050
benefit it's all about trade-offs so we

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,669
can look at the different choices

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,310
checkboxes radio buttons select venues

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,590
they all imply that every possible value

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:50,040
is represented so we're saying your

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:53,070
users pick the one right one if checkbox

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,240
is sure maybe multiple right once but

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,860
we're still saying we've got all the

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,170
answers all you have to do is pick them

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,790
out it's the real world that's being

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,960
rejected because it doesn't happen to

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:06,000
look like our personal mental schema so

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,820
checking a box is that one step action

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,380
that's really convenient entering a text

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,160
string takes more work it's not nearly

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,880
as accessible so that freeform solution

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,020
of a text area or a text field is not

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,930
automatically exciting and does have its

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:28,340
own drawbacks but it can also deliver

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:30,750
benefit to the users Part B metafilter

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,590
gender has been a text field for over a

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,240
decade and initially there were people

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,860
who utter Lee shuddered at this thought

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,800
a lot of members of the community are

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:45,090
programmers themselves and hated this

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,850
idea for about five seconds and then

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,820
they jumped on board because they got to

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:56,340
be creative and silly and honest and

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:59,060
real and they got to express this one

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:02,330
thing about themselves fully for once in

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,330
authentic voice

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,390
so that text field has grown into a

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,670
beloved institution and what you as a

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,620
user put into that field says something

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,660
really revealing about who you are and

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,030
that you're allowed to put in anything

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,230
that you're trusted to do that says

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,300
something revealing about what

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,020
metafilter as a community is meant to be

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,060
for so that's the schemas trust in users

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,330
and it's a foundation for users in this

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,670
case to ask for a lot more how often do

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,220
you see a nap where the users are saying

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,530
please please let me disclose more about

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,500
myself let me share with you everything

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:42,940
that's personal that normally we really

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:45,010
hate to have scraped from us so today

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,290
meta filters users are trusted with a

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,570
lot of freeform fills including ones

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,720
that most of us would usually try to

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,780
constrain or validate even really

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,660
nonsensical values are fine so you can

00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,410
have field values that are blatantly

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,530
contradictory that are just absolutely

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,590
crazy and there's no objection the

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:08,890
message is users we get this it's your

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:11,320
community it's your home so make it is

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,670
comfortable and personal and messy as

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,620
you want because we can handle that when

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,840
we're collecting data on people we're in

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,990
a different realm we're not in computer

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,730
science we're in social science and in

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,670
the world of social science if you want

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,260
to run useful research and analytics

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,090
about personal attributes and behavior

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,740
then your data collection needs to be a

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,500
little different it's got to meet two

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,270
minimum criteria the first is that it

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,970
fields values must include every

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,120
possible option this is called

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,400
exhaustive and the other is that the

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,820
options must be truly mutually exclusive

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,740
if there's overlap you have failed so

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,900
how many social apps have both of those

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,010
bare minimum criteria actually covered

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,710
we've seen this one plenty of times

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,900
right end sub set of values that seems

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:05,050
to cover things pretty well right pretty

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,610
exhaustive pretty exclusive no overlap

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:12,040
there right well you could argue about

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:15,959
bisexual it's not there's lots of ways

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,949
to represent sexual orientation

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,350
they're all reasonable they're all

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:23,309
valued some of them are expanding I each

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,629
other some are variations in thought

00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,879
we're not going to get there by adding

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,249
more list items that British Airways

00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,319
list this is where we're headed where we

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:36,300
just keep on adding things because we

00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,300
think that we can finally get to the end

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,629
instead we can choose to look at human

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,670
data from a really different perspective

00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:49,389
the data doesn't have to be securely for

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:53,199
analysis we can step back and we can

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:55,439
wallow in the users perspective that for

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,149
them it can be sheer expressiveness

00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:59,649
about their character their

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:05,499
individualism their personal

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:08,889
distinctiveness at diaspora another

00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:12,069
social network they also turned gender

00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:13,949
into a text field now I apologize you're

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:19,420
going to see some Ruby don't be scared

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:21,790
so more recently diasporas Sarah Mae did

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,399
that change to a text field and just

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,429
like on metafilter users really went to

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,800
town with this they really got to

00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,620
express all the things that they'd been

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,939
waiting to do some of which they didn't

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,470
even know they wanted to do until they

00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:40,209
had the chance to be silly of course

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,490
there are developers who were not amused

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,980
by that the difference is that

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,889
metafilter is a community built by

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,019
essentially one person whereas diaspora

00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,429
is open source it had a heck of a lot of

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,139
contributors it was dealing with

00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,540
internationalisation a problem that

00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:57,540
metafilter doesn't have and a big

00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,230
complaint was that this affects

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,629
internationalization of gendered

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,179
pronouns if you don't know whether

00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:05,980
there's male or female what do you know

00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:09,759
about internationalization of pronouns

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,059
right here's what I have to say about

00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:17,110
that it's a rat hole don't go down it

00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:18,369
it's hell it gets messy really fast once

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,649
you're dealing with internationalization

00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,720
because the way we think pronouns work

00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:24,279
in other languages isn't actually how

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,440
they work and I see a bunch of heads

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,910
shaking you know

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,920
it's a flan that comes with such a level

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,050
of complexity English has not wrapped

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,940
its head around at all in a lot of

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,850
non-english languages grammatical gender

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,380
and what you and I would call gender are

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,420
completely independent of each other

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,330
it's not something we can extrapolate

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,430
from male or female so

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:50,420
internationalization that's based on

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:55,070
that idea is always going to fail it was

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:57,080
already a problem but we could do

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,510
something about that so Randall Munroe

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,160
is best known as the source of XKCD and

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,290
he's also a physicist he's a pretty

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,480
bright guy and he's examined this

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,600
problem a number of times for english

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,210
language projects and finally asking

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,090
straight up which pronouns do you prefer

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,160
was truly the best approach that he

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,490
could come up with it all and as

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,980
complicated as this might seem it gets a

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,510
whole lot worse in other languages now

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,850
what I address one of the things here

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,640
that people see that third line down

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,770
they them there and I got kind of

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,740
horrified that can't possibly be a

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,340
singular pronoun right we all got taught

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,460
that in English class wrong it's been a

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,350
singular pronoun for 400 years

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:48,440
Shakespeare says Oh Chaucer Lewis

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,360
Carroll Jane Austen actually so does

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,250
Facebook so you know we got the whole

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,250
range of possibilities covered there as

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,130
developers we have a vision of what a

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,060
good code base should be and what it

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,890
should not be in the most sensible of

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,470
ways we often arrive at solutions that

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,740
are factually true fee but they're

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,450
really far removed from real life so we

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,760
we have this urge to have things that

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,410
are structured that are predictable we

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,960
want things that are nicely relational

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:21,230
we want indexes right you want to be

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,570
able to search all this stuff we think

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,920
we're doing exhaustive and we want all

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,570
this data because we want to be able to

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,670
analyze we wanted to be able to draw

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,880
conclusions we want to be able to use

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,010
this to monetize we want to be able to

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,790
make good decisions by having nice clear

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,550
objective data the thing is we end up

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,709
instead do

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,930
all these validations and throwing

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,490
exceptions and what we're really doing

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,800
every time we try to validate human

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,600
beings is we're actually invalidating

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,890
who they are so we're really being

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,709
counterproductive we do all these

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,959
conditionals you know all the

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,760
possibilities would you want to deal

00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,220
with all the possibilities of say that

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,670
British Airways form or even some of

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,360
those sexual orientation ones do each of

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,290
them have a different role in your app

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,959
we do all this premature optimization

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,240
you know horrified that but we can't

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,490
possibly just let go of constraints on

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,220
say field length you know I mean that

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,170
would consume a lot of disk space right

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,839
at the start of your app this is not a

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,880
problem this is the opportunity to

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,190
collect data on who's actually using

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,480
your app what they want to do with it we

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,760
can optimize for space later so we have

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,080
to acknowledge that there's cultural

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,030
variability all over the place and it's

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,710
not just cultural its individual and

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,720
most importantly it's changing

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,390
throughout time we're never going to get

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,700
to the end and figure out here's the one

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,169
solution here's the one way to deal with

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,020
these values here it's a one set of

00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:54,090
answers so we're making all these great

00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:00,780
data-driven decisions that are based on

00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:02,880
bad data so eros is an ongoing survey of

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,500
Americans religious identification it

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,400
asks just one really simple question

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,929
what is your religion if any and that

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,870
netted them over 100 unique answers

00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:16,530
which they filtered down to smaller

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:19,020
number of answers they compress it down

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,910
to 13 major categories and you can see

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:25,260
it's a lot easier to deal with than the

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,960
100 but you know we could use that in a

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,429
form if we wanted to although if you

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,200
look at some of those numbers some of

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:33,240
them are kind of edge cases right we'd

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,140
rather focus on the genuinely major

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,150
values get some nice big groupings right

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,919
so we can bring it down to this and at

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,140
least a quarter of Americans turn out to

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,360
be Christian of some denomination so now

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,650
we've got a pretty good set of data here

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,840
that we can work with every other

00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,540
religion is really just clutter edge

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,410
cases there you know we can let go of

00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,030
that

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,370
and then there's this sort of crummy

00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,840
data right I mean don't know or refuse I

00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,880
mean if we have no information that's

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,970
basically a null right I mean what are

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,610
we going to do with that so we could fix

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,080
that problem now our numbers are

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:14,190
starting to look really good and clear

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:17,370
so now we know what to do it covers all

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,130
the big stuff right those 100 categories

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,410
are represented here and when you get

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,560
reductive enough for Americans religion

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,780
is a binary from a storage span point

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:38,100
this is so great right this is just a

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:40,290
bully in school we don't do this it

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,200
covers the biggest categories that we

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,480
know this is really offensive we know

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,460
that this leaves a lot of people out and

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,440
they don't consider themselves edge

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,240
cases people are not edge cases and they

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,320
push back on apps that treat them that

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,780
way so trying to be reductive has all

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,020
these big problems at the same time so

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,060
just trying to scale upward as engineers

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,210
it's instinctually uncomfortable to step

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,830
away from this stuff to deliberately not

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:15,030
structure data for a nice easy clean

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:18,420
analysis and you know me too I got

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:20,970
uneasy but again that foundational

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,510
question is not what benefits me is

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,760
developer what benefits are there to the

00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:30,030
user what will they notice they're

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,540
benefiting and if necessary we can

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,620
strike some mill grounds this is linked

00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,460
in using guided response auto-suggest

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,350
they've got what they think are

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,280
comprehensive out set of values they're

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,440
wrong but they're doing their best and

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,960
they're letting you put in another value

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,980
if they still haven't managed to got get

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,660
everything there possibly is so auto

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,350
suggests that's that kind of balancing

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,240
act and when there's a subset of values

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,040
that we're personally most interested in

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,570
that we think are the most relevant for

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,730
what we want to accomplish we can do

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,190
some minimal auto-suggest instead

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,140
just using auto-suggest but starting off

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,870
with just that handful of values that we

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,490
think are the most useful and then

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,860
backing off as soon as they start

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,170
writing something else so it gives

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,900
structure for those who want it

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,670
including us and it also gives that

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,350
freedom to have that sort of

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:30,810
expressiveness for the people who want

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:32,850
that structured data is there when we do

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,890
that and it's a balanced solution that

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,690
in many cases where you're willing to

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,410
tolerate some ambiguity can work really

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,840
well it seems like we would lose you

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,150
know all of that clarity but actually a

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,830
lot of people will still go for the

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,770
clean defaults that we think are the

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,500
best ones but we also get to find out

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,510
who doesn't and how they identify and we

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,110
can start to make adaptations that fit

00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,480
them so we might have lower quantity

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:05,010
data but we're really getting higher

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,480
quality so you can do some mixing and

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,880
matching and find the right approach for

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,410
your users your apps business objectives

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,240
this isn't about what doing what's

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,050
empirically right it's about what's

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,730
doing right for the needs Facebook for

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,280
instance they make relationship status

00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:25,590
completely optional but they're pretty

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:30,540
coercive if you do set a value they give

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,950
you a constrained list so we do want

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,110
everyone to feel excited about what

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,240
we've built and we want users to feel

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:41,690
passionate about their involvement with

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:44,430
what we've built we want analytics

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,230
investments monetization these are all

00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,770
based on some sort of premise that that

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,330
data is accurate but the data that's

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,280
been collected by those coercive

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,840
approaches those constrained ones like

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,820
text checkboxes and radios they're all

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,970
taking a risk that we're really

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,670
collecting is just garbage that people

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,380
are lying because they have to that

00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,080
they've made that a requirement for even

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,850
getting past their front door so we're

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,160
drawing conclusions from that bad data

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,970
and it ends up misdirecting our decision

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,210
making it's really contradictory to our

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,210
goal

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,160
so those restrictive options that stuff

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,390
over on the bottom left we don't

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,400
actually have to make them required the

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:35,760
way we set up our schema is embedding

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,800
assumptions constantly about what should

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,440
be there and what we think has to be

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,690
there a field that's not allowed to be

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,510
null at all is destined to become

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,370
mandatory a field that sets a very short

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,220
length is asserting that any reasonable

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:55,710
value is knowable and it will definitely

00:23:50,220 --> 00:24:03,720
fit in there so this is making a lot of

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:08,100
assertions we can do less and serve

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:12,030
users better making that null explicit

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,950
is a communication to the team to our

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,350
future selves whoever else is

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:20,070
maintaining it's a statement of intent

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:24,930
it's documentation that we meant for

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:27,360
this to be optional so now we have a

00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:30,030
good discretionary field created in the

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:37,200
schema itself whether to respond is

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:38,550
going to be left up to the user so let's

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,940
say we really do have some sort of

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,700
canonical set of list items for some of

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,560
these things this one looks pretty

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,850
reasonable right I mean we've even got

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,440
some liberal stuff going on at the

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,770
bottom you know some sort of catch all

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,090
categories this is three years ago and

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,530
Facebook really felt like they were

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,120
doing well with this that they'd finally

00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:02,180
solve some problems got in a pretty

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,740
complete list users disagreed strongly

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,750
so under pressure Facebook had to nearly

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,360
double those list items in just two

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,300
years and once you look at it these were

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,470
also really reasonable values they

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,470
really should have been there all along

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,180
google+ when they launched largely

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:25,800
adapted that list they did make a few

00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:27,660
changes that I find interesting and most

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,660
importantly they added what Facebook did

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,140
not have the option to say I don't want

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,140
to tell you

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,669
allowing users to identify their

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,820
relationships with labels of their

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:42,830
greatest personal significance all of

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,989
that is being driven by users rejecting

00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,529
a user experience that doesn't work for

00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:51,139
them how did some status seem Universal

00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:54,139
while others weren't whenever we name a

00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:56,419
thing we're creating scope the assume

00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:58,850
validity of a fields values is being

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:03,889
constrained as soon as we named a field

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:06,619
itself marital status that's a field

00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:08,409
label right there and it could lead to a

00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,669
particular list such as this one

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:13,159
everything's in relation somehow to

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,080
marriage your assumed to be either

00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:18,850
unmarried preparing to be married

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,850
currently married formerly married

00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:24,980
whereas relationship status is already

00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:27,499
shifting the paradigm it might lead to a

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,190
list closer to this one in which either

00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:34,820
has a current relationship or is somehow

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,320
defined by the absence of any but

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:41,239
people's lives aren't arranged like this

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,919
either if you change the name now you're

00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:45,139
really shifting the paradigm and the

00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,139
possibilities and there's important

00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:50,779
differences in these and what we collect

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:53,389
and what we set out to measure naming

00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:56,090
fields with great specificity up front

00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:58,460
is going to keep us on track keep us

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,409
honest keep us collecting the data we

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:08,149
intended to and it's going to make our

00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:11,470
analysis later much more powerful lots

00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:13,879
of these statuses are overlapping

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,149
there's this sort of false premise that

00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:20,289
you're one at a time if someone's

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,999
widowed is that their status forever if

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:27,320
they start dating have they lost their

00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:29,210
statuses widower all the time we have

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,460
more than one status going on and

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,919
they're all real to us and some of them

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,350
to have to let go of that status a

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:40,179
declaration in public on some social app

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,179
is really painful

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:51,059
some people really don't have more than

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:54,240
one status that's fine all right take a

00:27:51,059 --> 00:28:02,880
really close look at this one can you

00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:05,510
spot the fatal flaw all right someone's

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,510
got to shout it out

00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,010
yeah so we have a one-to-one for

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,670
something that's inherently a

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,930
one-to-many and and of course when I say

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,280
one too many were talking now from the

00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,890
database standpoint where it could be

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,120
you know 120 121 or one too many but

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,940
we're leaving over to possibility

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,090
facebook isn't this is the modeling

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,540
relationships in a relational database

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:36,570
completely wrong this is what happens

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,460
when you just make concessions by adding

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,760
more list items by not really thinking

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,160
about what they're asking of you what

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,250
meaning is held behind the labels that

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:52,100
they're lobbying for so here are some

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:58,500
takeaways modeling the real world is

00:28:52,100 --> 00:29:00,950
genuinely complex that's okay assuming

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,050
that we know who users are is

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:09,390
surrounding our opportunity to learn who

00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:11,220
they are emergent data discovery early

00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:16,230
constraints in the schema are netting us

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,670
really crappy misleading data so we need

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,860
to keep constraints out of that user

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,410
schema at least for a little while at

00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:27,180
least at first so we can gather those

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:29,340
initial responses and finally more free

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,830
form fields definitely are not going to

00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,080
hurt us and potentially they have an

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:38,930
opportunity to really be a better user

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,150
experience so data quality is improving

00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:45,120
because lies become merely optional not

00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,570
required we get data that's rich and

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,830
specific just like real life is and we

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,080
kind of Earth the patterns that are

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,380
undetectable when that data is generic

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,350
and constrained you get to discover we

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,180
get to adapt we get to be something

00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,890
that's closer to the real world and

00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:06,210
makes a community feel like home and

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:09,560
those are the foundations for really

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,560
great user experiences

00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,060
how did we do on time very well if we

00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,980
don't have a lot of questions from that

00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,300
one I'll be quite disappointed so we

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:38,560
have quite a lot of time for questions

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:40,300
all right so fantastic talk I'm really

00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,860
eye opening for it can you tore up the

00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,810
volume on that Mike I can't hear it very

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:48,940
well I cannot it's gonna have to be done

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:51,040
at a panel somewhere so yeah great I

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:56,260
opening talk especially for you know

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,180
middle-class white straight guy so 22

00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,420
little questions are there any libraries

00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,640
or standards or guidelines that I could

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,780
kind of you know refer to when refer

00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:10,420
others to and the other one is how do

00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,010
you deal with clients and especially no

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,590
government organizations or even worse

00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,380
marketers yeah let's take this one at a

00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,300
time so as I said I'm a rubios so I

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,150
cannot help you at all with what exists

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,700
in the Python world there are some

00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,860
interesting libraries in Ruby some of

00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:31,600
which are adapted I believe from pearl

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:36,310
libraries and one of them has data sets

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,950
around the world of names so like birth

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,800
registries that kind of stuff and uses

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,600
that correlating with the gender put on

00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,900
the birth certificate and make some

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,330
probabilistic analysis to say if you

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,340
have a name like Judy there's a good

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,840
chance that that's a woman so we can you

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,690
know make that assumption without having

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,860
to ask and then you get some like say

00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,460
Francis where we might have to be a

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,700
little more we're gambling a bit the

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,620
problem is that not everyone identifies

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,780
with the gender that they were assigned

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:13,210
on their birth certificate and also

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:15,550
people get named funky things also I

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,960
mean I come from a country that's pretty

00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:21,960
ethnically diverse as do most of you

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,980
just because in a really fairly

00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,210
homogeneous society you could say that

00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:29,800
it's likely that this name is attributed

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,840
or connected with a certain gender

00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,890
really doesn't work in a society where

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,250
you got a

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,960
ethnically mixed population those

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,120
probabilities really get thrown out the

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,220
window I think those kind of libraries

00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,500
can be useful for things where you have

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,150
no other choice or where you're doing

00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,920
some of that auto-suggest where you

00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,290
might set them up with a default that

00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,500
you think is reasonable but allow them

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:55,240
to change it so you know if you've got a

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,910
really long form and you just want to

00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,800
give you know some reasonable input so

00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,390
that they can just you know move through

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,150
it really quickly something like that

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,280
can have utility but it can be really

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,170
dangerous to use to basically tell

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,600
people who they are or do it behind the

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,220
scenes I think that's where its most

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,750
dangerous is where we've never asked

00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,570
them at all and figure we can just you

00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,800
know work this out with a good library

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:40,120
does that answer the question well

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:42,610
enough great question okay so people who

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,940
have ethnic descent from Spain and

00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:50,470
Portugal represent the majority of the

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:53,320
world's population and in those ethnic

00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:55,660
traditions last names family names are

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,520
incredibly complex there isn't one name

00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,810
there's a string of names that are

00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,290
coming from both the paternal and

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:04,720
maternal side and when you have to put

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,930
something in a last name field that

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,159
becomes incredibly complicated for them

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,450
and usually what ends up happening is

00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,159
there some sort of length constraint

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,419
that messes with them or there's some

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,370
sort of parsing that assumes that a

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:18,280
space means that you know like this must

00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:19,899
be a middle name and so they end up with

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,640
you know things like they end up having

00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:23,380
to hyphenate their name which doesn't

00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,300
actually have a hyphen just to keep us

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,679
from parsing it wrong or they have to

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,110
throw out a whole bunch of their names

00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,520
which are you know like a tribute to

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,929
their family you're basically saying

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,890
like I'm going to throw this side of my

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:38,560
family under the bus for your form um so

00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:40,300
and then you have billions of Asian

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,330
populations where it's really common to

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,830
have the family name first that's not

00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,530
universally true but it's true in a lot

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,909
of Asian countries so now there's if you

00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,610
have a field that saying first name last

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,740
name now that the work out do you mean

00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,210
you want to know my family name or are

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,800
you trying to find out what my legal

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,220
name is because these are different

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,290
answers so first name last name is a

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,070
paradigm that really doesn't work in an

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,780
international context at all I really

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,850
think that unless you have some reason

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,410
where you need to say sort by last name

00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,120
or do searches that are limited like

00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,740
that that you're really better off just

00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,320
having a feel that says what's your name

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,700
and be specific about what you know like

00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,140
it could be how would you like to be

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,910
addressed what name would you like to be

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,860
addressed by versus you know what's your

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,100
legal name what's the context that the

00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,690
app is inquiring so if we can give them

00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,540
that kind of guidance than they can give

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,400
a better response okay your second

00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,690
question was about monetization and it's

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,950
a great question but other people have

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,730
questions so I'm going to try to circle

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:42,610
back to that one yes thank you very much

00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,580
for the talk first of all I must admit I

00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,260
hadn't considered this option

00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:50,270
and I'd been working in the industry a

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:54,680
while I've done a lot of government work

00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:58,050
over the years and identification has

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,670
always been a big bugbear for them and I

00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,790
think most of what they do with

00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,890
identification is based from a

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,350
bureaucratic point of view on terror and

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:11,670
when I say terror I mean the terror of

00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:15,330
being asked by a court who or what

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:18,330
someone is and so it is that these

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:22,500
options become codified because the

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:24,030
lawyers say I need this and if someone

00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,400
does something on your system which you

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,470
may be liable for you know if that's the

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,820
way the laws work in your country you've

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:35,520
got to have some we're falling back to

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:38,070
that um do I want to dress that part is

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,450
it's really interesting um Australia you

00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,880
should be so proud of yourselves because

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,160
a court in one of the states and i

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,170
apologize i don't remember which one

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,180
recently ruled that you can have a

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,490
gender of not specified that that is a

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,960
legal gender designation and you know

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,570
this is the first time i've heard of any

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,270
country doing this but now already our

00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:03,330
schema has to change you know like that

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,150
one person who won that lawsuit now has

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,920
established that this is a valid value

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:16,290
that has to be allowed to exist in our

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:19,500
database and there will be more was it

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:25,260
okay thank you New South Wales for the

00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,760
video yeah okay so given like you who's

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,260
got the mic raise your hand that's me

00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,300
say hi um given you can say I accept

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,330
these things as true that there are no

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,720
preconceived ideals how do you convince

00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:41,640
your business analysts that that is true

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,980
how when you draw a database schema and

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,460
you always make sure there are less

00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,530
constraints and like kind of the to get

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,560
out of whatever like get out of

00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:54,390
categorization options that they were

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,180
just scribble them out so you know this

00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,609
has to be linked yeah um

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,329
pretty scared of our customers a lot of

00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,230
times and we don't actually need to be

00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,970
when you're dealing particularly with

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,670
social data you're usually dealing with

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,650
big data and the customer for that is

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,180
really big data they're squashing

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,550
together data sets that are completely

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,170
unrelated that are collecting data in

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,770
different ways and they're really used

00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:24,079
to dealing with that so the fact that we

00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:27,300
have data that is not really perfectly

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,190
categorized is generally not a problem

00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,839
for them out of the small scale for an

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,430
individual app and maybe something where

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,770
you have to do some salesmanship within

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,170
the organization but I think part of

00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:40,319
that salesmanship should be we don't

00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,720
know we could be learning things that

00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:45,180
add more value that bring more people in

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,980
that make them more loyal that tell us

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,380
that we have an audience that we could

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,200
be going after much more effectively if

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,260
we knew they were there so the data can

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,790
be really valuable and it's hard because

00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,880
you do have people who are really scared

00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,589
like that would be less data and and I

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,799
won't be able to read it on you know

00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,660
like a nice spreadsheet anymore but I

00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,510
think we're also moving into a world in

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,920
which this is much more accepted

00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,010
document stores note equal I mean we're

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,859
starting to really get more invested in

00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:19,049
unstructured data anyway it's an

00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,420
interesting field if you want to learn

00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,579
more about it social big data and social

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,559
analytics are the key terms to look up

00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:28,470
and I also can give you tons of

00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:31,530
references to materials that i found my

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:34,470
Evernote is full of such things and I'm

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,940
happy to share and I think that

00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,559
partially addressed the second question

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,480
that you had is that now completely

00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,280
address okay more more question is how

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,920
we doing on time are we at a time okay

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,869
sorry I love to talk about this stuff

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,450
please do find me this weekend I am

00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:50,660
happy to field more questions thank you

00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,660
very much

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,700
we and we're actually still good for

00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,720
questions that we're actually still good

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:09,730
for question time if you want to

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:14,380
continue ooh bonus I'm excited all right

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:17,650
okay fantastic Todd and something that

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,950
is struggling me a bit is the idea that

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:24,620
we are losing a lot of cultural values

00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,940
trying to apologize on interrupt could

00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,980
you speak louder or can they turn out

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,440
the volume oh yeah yeah okay try that

00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,350
again please so yeah something is trying

00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:38,690
to miss the idea that we are losing

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:42,770
cultural values trying to feed all these

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:46,730
people information right into these

00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:53,960
discs red packets of information the

00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:58,010
systems and I face once the living in

00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:01,430
act in a society where I'm Western and

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,900
my data fits pretty well Facebook right

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,390
this relationship that you show in there

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,220
and then living inside with that doesn't

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,360
fit at all with the p.m. and I first

00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:13,940
myself asking someone like so you have

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,620
how many wipe do you have now like did

00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,880
you sell some camels and you have a new

00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:21,350
wife no because for facebook is not that

00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,820
cool like it's pretty cool if I just

00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:28,940
have one so I feel like we are losing

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:31,730
some cultures by this product and people

00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,820
is trying to fit into this whole systems

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:39,380
and and feel cool being Facebook goes

00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:42,020
things like that so um I'm very wrong

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,670
about it like what do you think that are

00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,640
we losing values or we should be

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,890
optimistic and say whatever happens

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,130
happens I draw me find very clear my

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:55,240
English prose I'm going to address some

00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:58,430
of the bigger points that you raised

00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,610
facebook is humongous iziz has in a

00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:04,610
number of countries and regions they're

00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:06,140
basically running behind regional social

00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:10,849
networks that serve

00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:14,809
local interest better that recognize how

00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:18,410
that local community actually works and

00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:21,890
so if Facebook were willing to give up a

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:25,039
little of their tight reins they could

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:27,559
be in markets much more effectively if

00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,450
they were willing to look at what's

00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,619
actually there instead of telling you

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:36,740
what you can be and I think that's

00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,960
something that we can all do is take a

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,240
lesson from that of that you know we can

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,980
serve the market we know but there's a

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,660
whole lot of markets that we don't know

00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,880
and understand and wouldn't it be great

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,160
if our data was telling us what those

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,869
are and who's starting to have interest

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,349
are we going to turn them away are we

00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:57,230
going to be surprised we'll make this

00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,000
the last question sorry it's not a

00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,819
question it's just a comment because I

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,279
just want to defend the Django community

00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,599
because that discussion about first name

00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:07,849
and last name I don't know if everyone

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,430
knows was had recently and in the new

00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:12,529
versions of Django there is not first

00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:17,750
name and last name what matters is short

00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:20,299
name which is dear ex dear dear john or

00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:24,049
whatever and long name so the long name

00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:26,750
is one field that can be ten names or

00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:28,519
one name or half a name or three names

00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,289
in any order and that's what you decide

00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,900
matters and I think that's the way that

00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:36,259
that community is taking that particular

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:41,000
dilemma I'm sorry can you clarify which

00:43:36,259 --> 00:43:43,279
community django Django okay yeah I I

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,349
think that still has problems because

00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:48,079
you need to add context to that for

00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:51,170
people for instance Japan you've got

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,480
some really structured social rules

00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,970
about how you address someone that it's

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,759
not just universally here's my short

00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:02,900
name and so you have to be able to

00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:04,700
inquire or the user has to be able to

00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,369
inquire you know what is it that you

00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,890
want from me and it may not be first

00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:13,599
name it may be what is the informal form

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,599
of address that's okay to use

00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:23,660
cool all right thank you very much

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,870
crooner this is for you some Norwegian

00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:31,820
blue coffee and a special pike on a loud

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:36,400
thank you and we'll be starting in about

00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:36,400
