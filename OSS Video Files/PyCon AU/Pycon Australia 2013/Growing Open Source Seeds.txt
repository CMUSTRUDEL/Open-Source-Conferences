This talk will be an in-depth review of the stages that most open source projects go though, and the decisions their maintainers face. Requests will be used as an example â€” lessons learned and best practices will be covered.
PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In July 2013, we're returning to Hobart, bringing together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python

our next speaker is the product owner of

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,040
Python at Heroku and a member of the

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,450
pythons off my foundation he's well

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,660
known for his many open-source project

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,429
including requests and is also known for

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,470
presenting one of the keynote speeches

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,390
at last year's bike on australia here in

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,980
Hobart this year he's sharing his

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,090
experiences in starting and growing open

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,710
source communities please welcome

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:31,260
Kenneth riots thank you everybody can

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,390
you guys hear me all right excellent

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,820
cool all right so hello everybody my

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,440
name is Kenneth rights if you'd like to

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
you can follow me on twitter at kenneth

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,780
rights and if you know who i am it's

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,360
likely from my github repo or my github

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,920
a profile i should say i maintained

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,890
quite a few open source projects and

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,329
spend a lot of my free time doing that

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,360
there's about 18 serious projects on

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,480
there and a lot of experiments apply my

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,129
most used library our project is OSX GCC

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,739
installer which allows you to install

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,350
xcode on or GCC on your Mac without

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,490
using Xcode because that's the worst

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,560
thing in the world having to install

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,970
xcode every time you want to set up new

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,820
mac and requests which is quite popular

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,310
I have some other interests I enjoy

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,270
street photography as I get to travel

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,740
all over the world to speak at

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,299
conferences like this place and it's

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,939
great because I get to go into the

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,240
cities and document the people that live

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,250
there which is really fun I also enjoy

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,720
synthesizers and video games and stuff

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,780
like that so if you want to chat with me

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,460
about that later please do I also work

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,570
for a company called Heroku who flew me

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,790
out here and we're sponsors at the

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,680
conference and basically what we are is

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,070
a really great platform for deploying

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,570
python web applications as well as web

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,280
applications written in other languages

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,439
and so if you have any questions about

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,119
that and we're also hiring at the moment

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,210
so you can come talk to me or jacob

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,030
afterwards or reese and without to chat

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,009
more about that i'm also remember that

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,200
python Software Foundation which is an

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,870
excellent organization who will be and

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,170
we will also be changing our member

00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:11,000
ship style soon so more people will be

00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,980
able to become a member through

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,890
association so keep your eye out for

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,160
that would be really great but I'm going

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:24,290
to open this talk with a little bit of a

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,620
story who here uses Facebook a lot of

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,690
people so once upon a time Facebook

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,970
releases project called the facebook sdk

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,190
it was a Python library it was available

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,260
on the github repo i believe it was also

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,130
on the cheese shop and it was the number

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:43,820
one supported official way to access the

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,560
facebook api's from python and facebook

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,610
on a very regular basis tells everyone

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,530
how about how much they love the

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,570
developers and they try to encourage and

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,970
foster people building apps on their

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,290
platform because that's mostly what

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,810
their business is getting people to run

00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,680
apps in their platform and what happened

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,600
is that a one day basically the API

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,020
changed so much that this library

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,640
stopped functioning completely so a lot

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,690
of people started opening issues you

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,700
know there was one in particular that

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,370
like got really high up on hacker news

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,600
and it had like over 100 comments of

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,820
people complaining about this problem

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,120
and there were just no word from

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,840
facebook at all it was horrible does

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,300
anybody remember this okay so basically

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
what happened was Facebook's response to

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,220
this problem instead of hiring someone

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,870
to solve this problem or you know get

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,250
someone to work on this something that

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,410
they claim is one of the most important

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,030
values instead they just disabled the

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,500
issue tracker on the github repo so

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,680
there were no more visible issues and

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,120
problem solved it's basically the worst

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,880
possible scenario that could have

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,970
possibly happened and you know this is

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,610
it was a open source library it had a

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,769
open license and but really it wasn't

00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,570
open source at all the open source that

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,390
we all know and love is about community

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,680
and fostering you know development

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,170
distributed development all over the

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,390
world and you know for the better of

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,370
mankind and this is the opposite of that

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,050
basically so this isn't really open

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,030
source this is a what i like to call

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,990
public source project

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,630
so basically what a public source

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,310
project is is an organization will

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,820
basically like they'll throw together

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,220
some code and you know it's better than

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,690
say keeping it closed source you know

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,370
they like the idea of well if this

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,450
doesn't if this has no proprietary code

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,340
in it or if it's useful to other

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,730
developers well throw it on our github

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,950
repo maybe other people will use it but

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,270
what happens is everyone these company

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,560
is often abandon these projects because

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,440
there's a lack of interest or burnout

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,520
change the focus you know the one in

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,020
turn that they had working on this

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,330
project maybe it doesn't work there

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,770
anymore no one even knows who owns it

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,660
and who knows what department is

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,990
actually maintaining it and

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,010
unfortunately this happens all the time

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,870
and the worst part about this is that

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,639
the motivate motivations behind the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,860
project or unclear are they trying to

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,910
you know they're trying to take

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,590
advantage of the development community

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,940
by giving them this piece of code or

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,229
they trying to do the opposite where

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,729
they're trying to foster their user base

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,740
so if you that's one side of the

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,540
spectrum of the open source world if you

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,130
go to the other side there's a project

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,050
called get tip which is basically the

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,220
polar opposite of a public source

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,590
project so is anyone here who here is

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,479
use gate tip just so I know excellent

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,470
more people should use it because i

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
believe they support international

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,090
payouts now before it was an american

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,160
only system for getting money in and out

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,620
so i could suggest you guys go check it

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,530
out basically what it is is it's a way

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,169
for sustainable crowdfunding basically

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,970
you can go to a developer that you liked

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,470
their code and then you can say i want

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,990
to give them a dollar ten dollars a week

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,750
or any amount between the things 0 100

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,520
now dollars and instead of it being a

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,320
one-time micropayment which is not very

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,660
sustainable this is you know on a weekly

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,100
basis and the goal is to eventually have

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,260
enough people and enough money in the

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,260
system where that people can use this as

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,570
like their full-time employee basically

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,950
and it this project is really cool

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,919
because remember this guy named Chad

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,460
Whittaker and he basically takes open

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,900
source to the absolute extreme and he's

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,220
trying to run what is called the world's

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,200
first open company so basically whenever

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,849
someone tweets Adam or something and

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,630
complains like oh I wish it did this I

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,640
wish it did that

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,140
immediately what he does is he goes and

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,410
he opens a github issue about the

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,730
problem and then usually he'll tweet

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,850
about it so other people can comment on

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:36,020
it in all the major decisions for both

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,520
the company like financial decisions or

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,640
otherwise security issues they're all

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,550
voted for on github normally which is

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,110
really great so he actually on trouble

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,030
recently kind of not in trouble but

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,590
thought it was controversial because he

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,380
checked crunch wanted to have an

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,840
interview with him about the project and

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,520
what happened was they didn't he live

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,660
streams basically all of his interviews

00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,190
of journalists because it's an open

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,330
source project he wants everyone to be

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,600
able to see all of the conversations

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,500
that occur around the project and

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,150
TechCrunch wasn't very comfortable with

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,340
that so of course all these other

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,330
organizations ate that up and we're

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,950
running all these stories about how

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,610
techCrunch's against open source and

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,840
everything it was pretty awesome but it

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,920
works out really well so all formal

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,630
discussions with other groups are

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,650
publicly documented and shared so if

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,530
you're a company and you want to partner

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,330
we get to basically you had your it's

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,960
only an option if it's a public

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,910
partnership and chad is famous for

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,410
saying I'm not building good tip i'm

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,000
building the community that is building

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,050
good tip this project isn't about him

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,360
it's about building something that's

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,120
greater than himself or than the people

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,160
that are a part of it so products like

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,200
get tip i call shared investment

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,240
projects do the opposite of a public

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,740
project a public source project where

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,470
the code is just slapped up there and

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,630
it's open source this is really about

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,340
having to share an investment in

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,310
something that to make so the greater

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,680
good the shared ownership your share

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,240
transparency new contributors can get

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,450
involved by following a very simple

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,010
documented process usually and it's very

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,530
low risk because there's a high bus

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,110
factor you know if chad gets hit by a

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,960
bus every single decision in all the

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,670
philosophies behind the project are

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,950
accessible on github basically and that

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,360
works out really well some other

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,880
projects kind of run in a similar way

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,580
not quite to that same extreme but a

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,290
python itself django firefox jquery

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,090
these are all things that don't have

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,280
like a single owner they are very much a

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,570
shared investment they are aiming to

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,700
change the world and that's not possible

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,190
if one person is basically and controls

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,110
everything

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,959
so I run a project called for quests

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,959
which is HTTP for humans basically it's

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,029
very difficult to do HTTP in Python by

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,910
default the standard library so I wrote

00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,300
a library to make it very simple to do a

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,339
lot of people really liked it and

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,810
basically this is a very popular open

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,209
source project I've had like over 100

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,980
developers contribute code to it very

00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:01,829
open to contributions from other people

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,420
and many people consider it to be a good

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,579
example of a great open source project

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,649
but it's a very different style project

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:12,000
from get tip from Jengo from jQuery from

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:14,189
Python basically zero of the product of

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,139
the projects decisions are made by the

00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,819
community and they're all made by me

00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,300
which is a very very different way of

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,649
doing things so I like to call this it's

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,569
somewhere between a public source and

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,920
the shared investment project and I call

00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:30,930
it a dictatorship project so basically

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,060
what a dictatorship project is is it's

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,699
at the front of the project you have a

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,130
totalitarian btfl that basically owns

00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:39,120
everything related to the project

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,459
they're responsible for all the

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,019
decisions and community feedback is

00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,180
really encouraged lots of people can get

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,649
involved but the users with the feedback

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,180
shouldn't have any expectation that

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,189
change is going to happen you know like

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,420
if they come to me with a specific thing

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,269
that they won't happen you know there's

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,649
if it doesn't fit into the scope of what

00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,959
i believe requests should be doing and

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,060
it's not going to happen in some people

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,740
like that some people don't but

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,449
basically the way i like to approach

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,130
this is is it considering the open

00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,750
source project more of a product and it

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,699
needs a lot more attention to detail

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,079
than a crowd source project could be

00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:15,029
it's the the tragedy of the Commons so

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,279
request value really lies in its extreme

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,600
opinions and with very few in people

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,920
involved at the core of the decision

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,779
making process it allows for really

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,970
quick precise iterations and you know I

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,019
don't have to explain all the decisions

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,319
that I'm making all the time which is

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,610
really nice at the same time you know

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:32,819
it's that wouldn't really work for a

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,800
project like Python because those

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,480
opinions could be diluted if people were

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,809
more people were involved with the

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,850
decision making process of course there

00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,339
are some downsides to this fat to this

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,410
approach as well the bus factor is

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,139
extremely low so

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,699
when I go home tomorrow if I get my

00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:51,560
plane crashes you know it'll be very

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:55,490
unclear what the process is to maintain

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,670
the project after that no and helpline

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,930
LAX so the chances i'll be in a crash or

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,790
poly greater and the risk of burnout is

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,399
extremely high so I'm like the central

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,629
point of failure you know if I'm not in

00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,439
the mood to maintain the project that

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:14,240
it's not going to get maintained in this

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:16,759
so I've learned a couple of things to

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,860
kind of figure out how to make that more

00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,420
sustainable the sustainability is the

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,660
most important part of any open source

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,959
project the first in the most important

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,810
one is to be cordial or be on your way

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:32,029
this is extremely important basically

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,829
all interactions with if you're a

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,420
contributor to a project it's very

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,550
important that you keep all interactions

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,639
with the maintainer as absolutely

00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,370
respectful as possible basically you

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,540
know they they have created the spent a

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,600
lot of time creating something that

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,189
other people can use and they put a lot

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,930
of time and energy into the project so

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:53,630
you shouldn't act like they owe you any

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,430
of their time but at the same time it

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,620
should they should be as cordial to you

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,449
as possible as well if you're a

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,009
maintainer of a project you have a

00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,540
crucial responsibility of being

00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,980
immensely thankful to all of your

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,600
contributors and I think this is a

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,680
problem that a lot of projects a lot of

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,300
people that run a lot of projects have

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,370
someone will open an issue or a no pull

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,959
request and they'll be kind of ambiguous

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,250
or it's not a good pull request we'll

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,600
just like close it will be like this

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,970
sucks i'm not going to respond to you

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,250
i'm not going to be nice to you there's

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,170
it's like a default hostile environment

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,910
and it's a it's a horrible toxic thing

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,819
that should should be tried to be

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,250
eliminated if at all possible basically

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:34,160
your contributors in your users of your

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,740
project are the the lifeblood of your

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,269
project so you know you if someone gives

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,980
you not constructive feedback which

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,779
happens all the time it's really

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,250
important to ignore that you know don't

00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,839
try to take it too personally don't try

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,160
to get caught up in the negativity

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,870
that's being Rozen from that but be

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,430
really encouraging to new contributors

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,559
and yet to realize that a lot of people

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,559
take the code way way way too seriously

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,400
so to do this I think it's really

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,470
important to be very careful with the

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,600
words that you choose contributors

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,700
sometimes will take what you say very

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,040
very personally so a lot of people kind

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,750
of go along the side of you should be

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,000
judging a pull request or a contribution

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,180
purely on the code and if it's not good

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,410
you should like tear it apart and I kind

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,660
of do the opposite of that basically

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,790
where I try to be as encouraging and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,230
uplifting is possible because these

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,910
people taking time out of their day to

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,980
work on a piece of code that I've you

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,510
know like on my project that's amazing

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,460
like that's I can't believe that someone

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,930
would do that so you should be immensely

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,660
thankful to these people because your

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,670
project would be useless without them so

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,910
if they do something that's not really

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,560
in line normally like they just say this

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,380
doesn't work in a political you know in

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,970
a github issue you can take the

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,190
opportunity to educate the user instead

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,380
of instead of brandishing them basically

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,060
so usually it's really great to have

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,220
good documentation around all the

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,350
different aspects of your project like

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,690
here's what we kind of expect around a

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,970
pull request or around an issue like it

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,170
needs to have tests and then instead of

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,270
just yelling at them like this doesn't

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,650
have tests you can like kindly point

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,640
them in the right direction kind of show

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,610
them that hey there's information

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:14,330
there's resources for this to help get

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,280
them to the next step in something that

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,040
happens surprisingly often in the Python

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,180
world at least for my projects is

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,100
oftentimes someone will just have some

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,720
kind of weird issue and you know I'll

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,490
help them out and they kind of go the

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,540
extra mile of being cordial and then we

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,620
come to me later and they'll tell me

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,840
that that's like that was their first

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,640
contribution ever an open source and

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,930
that could happen this probably happens

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,250
with projects all the time and if you're

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,720
negative towards that person that could

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,000
scare them away from doing open source

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,010
forever which would be a horrible thing

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,020
I think this happens every day so as a

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,450
contributor sponsibility to be to try to

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,310
foster and educate people a little bit

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:54,290
of kindness really goes a long way so

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,490
for maintaining requests as well I've

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,800
learned a couple of things to avoid

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,230
burnout because it's very very easy to

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,880
get burned out especially when a project

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,560
project is popular and it has a lot of

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,279
users that are constantly bothering you

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,740
about

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:11,959
things basically sustainability is the

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,360
most important challenges of any open

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,620
source project you know people are

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,259
taking time out of their day it's a

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,519
distributed system people if this you

00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,470
know it needs to be sustainable we need

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,649
to have a set amount of time to be able

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,120
to contribute to the project and

00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,800
spreading that around makes that a

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,829
little bit easier because everyone has a

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,089
limited amount of time and unfortunately

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:35,389
it's very easy to become the bottleneck

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:37,790
for your own projects so this is a quote

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,559
by a co-worker of mine Wes he maintains

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,110
a very popular library for Ruby called

00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:45,519
fog which is kind of like lib cloud for

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,480
for Ruby basically and it goes like this

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,759
open source provides a unique

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,579
opportunity for the trifecta of purpose

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,199
mastery and autonomy by recognizing the

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,879
power of these factors we can keep

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,920
ourselves motivated and continue to

00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:59,779
increase our impact so making the world

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,189
a better place by grasping all the

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,110
different aspects of open source and not

00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:06,970
just focusing on code we're not just

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,930
focusing on process so these guys are

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,209
people that help me without with my

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,529
projects and these guys are amazing and

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,139
they are basically the reason I haven't

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,509
been burned out it's cory and ian i

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,379
recommend you follow these guys or

00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,120
something because they are like

00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,600
seriously the best contributors on

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,939
planet earth are amazing and basically

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,559
what i have to learn to do while

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:30,680
maintaining these projects is learn how

00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,600
to do less and these guys allow me to do

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,819
that so when an issue or pull request

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,019
comes into the repo these guys are

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,819
usually different people to respond to

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,769
it now normally I'm like at a conference

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,259
I'm speaking and you know and i'll get

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,670
back home i'll have like 45 issues and

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,250
pull request to review and it's like

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,459
this big long laborious process but

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,170
these guys triage the only issues for me

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,639
so they will be like the first person to

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,100
respond it will help people improve the

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,689
code will try to educate the user or you

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,059
know recommend that it gets merged at

00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:00,860
any time and this saves me an immense

00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,480
amount of time and they get to learn a

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,419
lot about maintainer project in the

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,520
process so i get to focus my time on the

00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,049
larger you know more pressing issues in

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,630
the project instead of a lot of these

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:12,949
little small things then they help the

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,720
contributors make the best time of their

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,899
efforts so it's a really a win-win

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,899
situation

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,370
and here's a quote from Corey that he

00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,870
did one day is it as I for can other of

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,730
his projects it occurs to me that I

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,590
don't program in the Python ecosystem I

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,860
program in the Kenneth rights ecosystem

00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:32,360
is it's a bit silly but it's it's very

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,860
rewarding to see him say something like

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,010
that because really what it does is it

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,480
shows me that you know if you're if you

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,570
try to foster your contributors try to

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,680
foster you users basically like there's

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,960
no there's no bad thing that can happen

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,700
it is all good positive things that are

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,500
happening he is gonna you know he gets

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,180
him involved in the other projects that

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,550
I work on other projects that are kind

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,530
of related to requests like oh off lid

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,540
for example for OAuth he's very involved

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,770
in that and it kind of spreads and

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,730
spreads and it's really great this is

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,530
the most important thing that I've

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,040
learned while maintaining my projects

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,540
and it is to learn how to say no no is

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,820
basically the most difficult thing to

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,870
learn how to say people are going to

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,940
come to you and they're going to ask for

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,130
the most ridiculous features in the

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,540
world that you you'll be I have been

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,150
absolutely astonished at the things

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,530
people have asked for like four requests

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,650
people wanted it so if it would return

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,900
an HTM like if you're getting an HT HTML

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,160
response it would like automatically

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,170
give you a dom tree instead of the

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,840
content basically and crazy things like

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,760
that you know XML parsing and xpath

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,920
support and and all these things that

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,680
make sense for these that you know for

00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:43,250
that use case but not at all for the

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,690
core project you know these are people

00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,130
that are trying to help the project or

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,310
try and make it better for them but

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,350
really it takes someone that has more of

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,960
a bigger picture approached realize

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,850
what's good and bad so if you say yes

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,770
very often you'll find and this happens

00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,750
with a lot of projects your project will

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,940
very slowly and systematically be

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,790
destroyed and this is also known as a

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,060
tragedy of the Commons there's this

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,730
great guy named Peter Hitchens he is the

00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:12,170
CEO I believe of zeromq which turns out

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,790
to be a company as well as an open

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,520
source project he's a pretty cool guy

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,990
and he's well known for saying

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,580
simplicity is always better than

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,380
functionality and that's something that

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,840
I try to put into all the projects that

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,910
I maintain I'd say that this is

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,960
definitely something that's stylistic

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,309
you know I don't think every project

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,990
needs to be as simple as possible but

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:34,169
my projects that's what I try to do and

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,169
if you go down that route of trying to

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:38,940
support every users use case you know

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:41,070
not I'd like to encourage people to

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,980
focus on the ninety percent use case and

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,970
not the one hundred percent use case you

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,159
know if there's something that's going

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,899
to make the project harder to use for

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:50,309
nine you know for ninety percent of your

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,480
users to support 10 of them then it's

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,379
probably not a good thing that you

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,600
should be adding so basically if a new

00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:59,789
pull request comes in and it adds some

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,139
nice features but adds complexity more

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,490
difficult things to maintain something

00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:05,490
that a maintainer doesn't necessarily

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,950
understand it's a good idea to say no to

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,559
that feature regardless of how useful it

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,450
is a good example for this for me is

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,460
like Kerberos authentication used to be

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,379
built in and I have no idea how that

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,119
works no there's anyone else who

00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:19,379
maintains the project so it would break

00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,049
all the time we didn't have any tests

00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:23,749
for it I was horrible so this you know

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,919
learning how to say no to this feature

00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:27,450
kind of encouraged us to start thinking

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,249
about things in a different way we made

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,299
a more pluggable modular system so

00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,759
someone else could make their own

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,990
library and maintain it you know and

00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,509
just kind of pass it in as an argument

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:40,499
and everybody wins kind of teaches you

00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:44,159
to make things more modular and you know

00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:46,470
that's what open source is all about and

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,820
I try to make basically as many this few

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,399
lines of code as possible in all my

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,980
projects simple code is a really great

00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:55,440
thing it makes things a lot easier to

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,580
maintain code solves problems normally

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,639
that are created by humans not machines

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,080
so if you are always bending over for

00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:04,559
the machines and your code is going to

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,200
end up being really complicated it's not

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,480
good negative dips are the best dips in

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,279
full request and it kind of encourages

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,289
you to build these sharp small

00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,999
distributed services and modules and

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,619
pluggable architectures things that

00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:20,909
everyone kind of agrees are good things

00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,169
complex code can be basically the worst

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:24,029
thing in the world if you look at a lot

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,070
of projects that people kind of regret

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,149
in there you know I have a big like

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,619
weight on their shoulder when they're

00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:31,379
talking about it or maintainer hates

00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:35,460
himself it's often because the code is

00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:37,019
very complex and monolithic these kind

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,759
of code bases really encouraged tight

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,809
coupling of different services in

00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,059
different components

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:44,999
can have lurking and growing technical

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,279
debt can be very difficult to maintain

00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:49,690
especially if someone it's only one

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:53,950
person maintaining the project and it

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,749
can be extremely horrible and this

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,190
leaves to the project being self-serving

00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,490
project instead of a problem-solving

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:04,899
project and no one likes that so learn

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:07,210
to say no to all the things open source

00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:09,519
makes the world a better place please

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,440
don't make it complicated and that's

00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,470
everything does anybody have any

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,470
questions

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,050
hi thanks for the talk thank you we

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,110
sometimes see news about big projects

00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,970
being forked into two communities now is

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,230
that ever a good thing do you think is

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,270
it something that needs to happen I

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,180
think it can absolutely be a good thing

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:49,820
but it depends a lot of things now the

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,880
best example that I always use is Jane

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,050
Eyre Hudson being fork into Jenkins when

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,540
really it was actually the opposite

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,510
happening so basically there was are you

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,580
familiar with the story basically yeah

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,890
and he used it after it became Jenkins

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,620
yeah so there was this Hudson project

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:08,570
and then son are some was bought by

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,440
oracle and it was a son project and

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,750
basically one day oracle just kind of

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,370
came into their like boardroom basically

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,840
on IRC and was like you guys aren't

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,060
running this anymore this is our project

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,260
and they're like you can't do that and i

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,580
guess you can't we have to trademark on

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:27,230
the name so oracle story is that the

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,810
community forked the project and it's

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,100
like this reckless abandonment thing but

00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,570
really if you talk to the jenkins

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,670
maintainer the people who created the

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,680
project what happened was the community

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,450
decided to change their name an oracle

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,660
fork the project and continuing on the

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,390
old brand which was very bad thing so

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,680
I'd say that the in that case you know

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,740
the forking of the project was

00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,740
definitely absolutely required and it

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,090
was a great thing but um you know that

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,550
was definitely a very political thing

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,680
right so are you talking about more the

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,390
idea of like someone has a code base

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,680
they don't like it so they just kind of

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,930
fork it instead of instead of

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,650
contributing that's kind of the thing

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,750
that I see happen a lot right yeah

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,710
that's usually not as good but it

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,970
depends like it depends on the

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,170
maintainer the worst thing is when

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,460
someone Forks your project and they

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,140
don't talk to you about it first like

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,200
the you know they like going on a big

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,070
rant on on they write a blog post

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,930
complaining about all these problems and

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,670
they never discussed it with the

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,040
maintainer 'he's so i think that you

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,770
know if you discuss things first that

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,490
can solve a lot of those problems

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,490
personally thank you

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,840
so with your contributors to two

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,030
requests do they actually have write

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,600
access to your code or is that still

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:46,120
held by you but for Ian and Cory yeah

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,280
they are they have full access on github

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,380
and basically what what the kind of

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,960
policy is that they typically don't make

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,340
any changes to the code base when

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,440
there's a pull request or they'll close

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,450
a lot of issues things like that and

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,970
they'll like tell me what's ready to

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,920
merge and I'm kind of encouraging them

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,650
to start merging the small things that

00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,410
are very obvious but they're they're

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,620
still figuring it out and so did you

00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,970
work with them to sort of help them

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,860
understand your sort of vision for the

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,590
project so forth or they'll be able to

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,630
pick it up as it goes along can you do

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,830
it one more time sorry yeah so did you

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,440
work with them to sort of help them

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,790
understand yes your vision for the

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,960
project as well well that's the really

00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,480
interesting thing that happened that

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,790
surprised me is that basically like one

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,340
day I just saw this one of these two

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,630
people just kind of like closing like

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,010
telling me a bunch of issues need to be

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,780
closed because they were older they had

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,450
already been fixed all these kind of

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,000
like housecleaning things that I was

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,560
really bad at and so i just added them

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,360
as contributors one day and I said hey

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,010
guys no don't make any changes the code

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,750
base but you know I've really loved if

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,730
you guys would uh you guys are doing

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,280
great so I want to encourage that and

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,470
then slowly over time what happened was

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,560
like one of them like there'll be an

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,480
issue that comes in and they'll agree

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,830
that it should be in but they know that

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,840
I won't like it so they'll say that

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,940
basically which is super cool they'll be

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,710
like you know I don't think Kenneth is

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,560
gonna like this but you know here's the

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,420
reasons why he should like it and it

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,340
works out really well and I feel like I

00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,830
don't know how to repeat that I think of

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,540
just kind of because they're amazing but

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,540
I think maybe just trying to be as

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,660
fostering and encouraging as possible

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:28,380
ideally would encourage that behavior

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,380
thanks very much yeah

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:37,799
do you think there's a tendency at the

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,549
moment to encourage people to do things

00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:43,349
on behalf of other entities so

00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,499
organizations wanting people to like

00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:48,529
things on Facebook gamification buying

00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:51,090
by thanking people publicly for things

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:52,859
do you think there's a tendency for open

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,309
source projects that make a big deal out

00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:58,229
of contributions to kind of poison their

00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,489
user base by stopping it from being

00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,139
about contributing and being about

00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:03,119
getting the recognition for contribution

00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:04,559
say get tip if get tip made a big deal

00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,389
about the major contributors for

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,129
something do you think that could have a

00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:09,929
negative impact on what people feel

00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:11,970
about contributing that it's about

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:14,340
getting kudos rather than contributing

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,080
potentially I mean I think so what I do

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,359
in my projects is if someone submits

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,999
even a one-line like typo fix I add them

00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,440
to the author's file and I think that

00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,269
does two things one it makes those

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,590
people that did a small change it feel

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,450
like it was insignificant or they might

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,940
even be bothering the maintainer it

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,950
makes them feel you know really like

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,590
they did a good thing which they did and

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,509
I feel like the larger that file is the

00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,519
less important that recognition would be

00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,809
kind of in a way where you know I have a

00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,729
few have a hundred people in the file

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,379
that's a lot different than having four

00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:45,779
I feel like it makes it a lot less

00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:47,580
intimidating it as well and that's

00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,679
that's kind of the path that I go down

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,629
but if your project like Django I mean

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,399
if you just did every if you had an

00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,399
author's file for every single line

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,809
change it would be ridiculous so I don't

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,940
know it's it I think it really depends

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,940
on the project and the maintainer

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,389
anybody

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,250
