	00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:04,980
so we have 14 talks for you hopefully

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,259
you'll get through those pretty quickly

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,970
at first we have Russell Stewart who's

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,620
going to be talking about LR parsing

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,759
followed by Graham Cross Russell your

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,759
time starts now

00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,880
hello everyone my Tom I'm going to talk

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,230
about a module I write could a lot of

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,960
parsing well that's what I've dubbed it

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,730
it's actually just another mousetrap we

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,560
have lots of these mouse traps I'm going

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,989
to try and convince you that this amount

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,280
of trap is an improvement over the

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:41,309
previous models it is surprise surprise

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,469
apasa for those who don't know what a

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,320
parser does a parser is something we use

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,920
to recognize computer languages so they

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,690
take in a set of text you might write it

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,610
to use them to write your own domain

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,100
specific language or you might want to

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,770
analyze existing code that's in fact

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,719
what I want to do I wanted to tear apart

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,030
some SQL statements so just to reinforce

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,600
what it does this is a spec to be a

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,189
string of text what we want to do is all

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
of you being programmers have instantly

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,000
passed this text and as obvious to you

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,500
what it means but it's not obvious to a

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
computer it's just a series of

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,750
characters the underlying bits are words

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,860
obviously that's the job of the

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,450
tokenizer the parser then identifies

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,070
bits of the words how to say well

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,460
where's a keyword and selects the

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,619
keyword column is an identifier greater

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,299
than is an operator and four is a number

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,829
and so on and it'll say well okay this

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,649
thing here on the end

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,869
that's another expression so I can just

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,420
call that an expression and we continue

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,939
down on the other end we have selected

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,390
from clauses we reduce it to another

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,180
expression we reduce it and what you end

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:02,090
up there with is a tree like structure

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:05,790
which is usually called the parse tree

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,680
so what any parser does really is taking

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,979
a sequence of characters and output a

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,700
parse tree now as I said there's lots of

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,700
these mouse traps

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,209
there's lots of these mousetrap a quick

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:27,520
hitter pausing on Popeye or will deal

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:29,800
about 521 the wasn't that I later

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,950
discovered thanks to Nick that everyone

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,519
actually uses is apply but I I happened

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,599
to be number 506 now I looked at a few

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,390
of these but I didn't look at all of

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,950
them and I didn't get to 506 so why use

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:51,370
our housing at all if I have a found

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:54,400
ploy wouldn't exist but I didn't so the

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,920
first one is speed I don't know whether

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,380
you use P why pausing it looks easy to

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,530
use there's the SQL statement up there

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,060
py parsing doesn't posit at least the

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,310
example grammar they have doesn't parse

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,040
it but others do if you look at our

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,760
parsing it nearly twice as fast as in

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,209
your competitor the next one is

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,140
documentation I tried a few of these

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,170
learning how to drive them is an

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,940
exercise in frustration so py parsing

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,420
gives you lots of sample code and urges

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,000
you to buy their book parsing which is

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,109
what I moved to next a very capable

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,500
positive written by an academic has

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:35,950
comments in the source code out of that

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:41,319
lot ply definitely has the best part

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:44,160
it's a tutorial LR parsing has Spinks

00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,660
like documentation 10 K words thereof

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,829
and it goes on and on and on

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,829
including his tutorial

00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:00,970
it also comes with a working sqlite3

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,490
parser which I tested on all the SK like

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,730
your chest so it's past two thousand six

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,890
hundred odd SQL like three statements

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,960
and finally I wanted to convince myself

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,140
it really could be a compiler so I wrote

00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,790
her Lua to pison compile a little of

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,830
being the simplest language there isn't

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:23,320
part of being a machine I know more

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:25,780
about in terms of simplicity I just used

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,340
PRI metrics to compute the size of

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,110
source code of each and I think the size

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,750
of source code is a real reasonable

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,310
indication of how hard the thing is to

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,710
understand in terms of parsing power

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:43,510
there are non deterministic parses out

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:46,720
there of the non non deterministic ones

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,450
LR parsing is one of the best in terms

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,130
of expressing the grammar the top one

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,160
there's LR parsing the bottom while in

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,530
its ply this is actually unfair to LR

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,900
parsing because you see it specifies of

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,430
token oysters and it's three lines there

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,020
is literally an order of magnitude

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,790
difference in the amount of stuff you

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,750
have to enter to get the same

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,880
recognition lr parsing is actually a

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,370
compiler it composed your statements to

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,030
lr ll ones productions and if that's it

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:19,110
gives you other useful things one Aramis

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,110
is very much Russell

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,090
and I think it speaks volumes to this

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,050
community that we got a round of

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,570
applause when you mentioned

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:39,220
documentation so up next on this podium

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,440
will be Russell Keith and gay brand

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,660
cross up next who will be presenting

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:57,010
Grand Cross citizen engineer your time

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:58,750
starts now can you hear me in the

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,330
keynote yesterday Alex touched on a

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,070
topic that's dear to my heart and a few

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,740
other people did in the keynote I mean

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,480
the Lightning talks engineering the

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,290
intersection of science technology and

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,820
society I'm a scientist I pretend to be

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,040
an engineer I work in biomedical

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,700
technology the thing that fascinates me

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,560
though is Society and in particular how

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,180
can we help Society if you look at how

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,690
society has changed across human

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,490
lifespan the Stone Age the Bronze Age

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,130
Industrial Revolution information

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,990
revolution all driven by technology so

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,420
how can we as technologists shape the

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,050
future we're uniquely placed because

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,810
we're smart

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,540
we've got skills and I think that means

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,610
we have a responsibility this book if

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,920
you're not familiar with it is probably

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,960
the books that helped shape our thinking

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,600
about social responsibility and

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,570
engineering if you've not seen it hunted

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,120
up have a read it's a fantastic book so

00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,100
this is 72 slides which may be the

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,760
record for a lightning talk on how can

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:08,020
we do this we engage we communicate we

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,520
lead as engineers so I'm going to talk

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,230
about a few different areas in which I

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,090
think we can make a difference small

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,500
differences as individuals collectively

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:19,180
large large large large differences I do

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,880
not pretend to have all the answers but

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,490
I do have suggestions so hold on to your

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,760
seat and let's go for a ride

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,760
children are our future

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,160
we're part of the community this is a

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,990
community we're all parts of virtual

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,330
communities we live in urban communities

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,660
suburban communities rural communities

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,530
it is a massive part of how society

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,530
thrives and changes

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,219
our rights Edward Snowden has showed

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,979
that our rights are constantly under

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,539
threat and there is a real chance of

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,759
erosion and that's the future

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,860
generations live in a society that

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,610
George Orwell would have absolutely

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,610
shuddered about

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,750
computing we've talked a lot about

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,750
computing for some reason this weekend

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,050
we're all part of the world

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,130
and I'm serious about that we may think

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,160
that things like curing cancer is

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,960
outside of our domain but from

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,960
everything you've seen this weekend

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,820
pandas ipython notebooks things like

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,800
that are written by people like us and

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,450
used everyday by scientists around the

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,310
world to help make the world a better

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,570
place if you don't know how there's

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,520
things like random hacks of kindness

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,980
which is where people come together and

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,430
hack to work on things like disaster

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:37,290
management community websites and things

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:39,390
like that I hope you don't feel like

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,760
I've preached to you that I do hope that

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,100
this challenges you inspires you and

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
that when you wake up in the morning you

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,370
actually feel like you have a purpose

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,149
and that you can make the world a better

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,149
place call me optimistic and naive

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,070
okay uh so on this side of the room we

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,170
have Russell Keith McGee and up next on

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,300
this side is Frank

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:28,260
so Russell is going to be presenting on

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:30,010
Django user groups and his time starts

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,890
now

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,230
all right so thank you very much this

00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,000
actually talks a DuckTales nicely into

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,290
the previous talk at least one one set

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,670
of slides from that previous talk we're

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,500
talking about this about Django users

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,140
groups around Australia and around the

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,120
world okay who here is from Perth a show

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,800
of hands if you are from Perth all right

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,820
how many of you did not know that there

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,010
is a Perth Django users group all right

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,240

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:15,470
is also a fantastic opportunity to meet

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,620
North American and worldwide Django

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,509
users next year may a puffle probably

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,670
May 2014 date to be announced or not

00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,680
quite sure yet Django con Europe will be

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,839
on again it is going to be hosted on the

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,220
French Riviera those of you who aren't

00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,630
aware Django con Europe Bashir is in

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,339
Warsaw and it was one of probably the

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:35,000
best conferences I they ever been to it

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,139
was awesome and the the French team is

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,310
claiming that they're going to be able

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,110
to they're going to take it even further

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,540
so if you can get to the French Riviera

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,740
next year I highly recommend it if only

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,970
because it's the French Riviera

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,860
and lastly django con Australia 2014 it

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,630
is going to happen dates and locations

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,059
to be announced I'm led to believe

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,399
possibly to be announced in about 30

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,689
minutes because it is also going to be a

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,329
mini con for the same as it was this

00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:00,800

away a lot of the village go that's the

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,510
fear in a person's eye when they're

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,310
facing something really nasty we are

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,840
facing something seriously nasty next I

00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,390
don't know how that got there this is

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,450
what we're planning to try and build a

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,220
system so that we can crowdsource

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,919
information about

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,760
where people's infrastructure is so that

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,870
we can help them build policy about

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,070
where they're going to build that stuff

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,490
what they've got and all the rest of it

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,740
next slide we don't have these guys I

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,309
don't know why not I haven't worked out

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,070
why not

00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:57,130
we had them when I was are they puppets

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,970
six or seven yeah but they were really

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:04,090
good puppets they made a difference by

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,470
one every time they went to save you

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:13,779
your butt was saved and isn't at the

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:16,600
moment mixed right so that's what the

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:21,130
project's called it's lots and lots of

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,279
different Python lots of Java

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,620
lots of PHP I'd like it all to be a lot

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:30,279
more Python it the byth and I've done

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,289
has been very very educational I first

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,919
ran into Python when I discovered that

00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:38,919
it was whitespace sensitive in about

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:43,299
1992 I think anyway I put a white space

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:47,470
in there and it died very alarming on

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,950
the live web site next same slide keep

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,529
going

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,049
what are you done to me okay this thing

00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,679
this thing was supposed to work but it

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,139
doesn't

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,820
we'd have to flip over to Safari we'd

00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:59,830
have to wait for it to load and it would

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,870
take the whole five minutes essentially

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,620
what it does is it gets the netcdf file

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,990
from this next slide ski from this tiger

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:12,899
server thing it gets an it Cydia far

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,899
from that parses it takes half an html5

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,779
chart puts the pars into the Hanson

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,440
table on the back of it and then plots

00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:24,669
it up in 2d you can see for Tasmanian

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
temperature data you see that lovely

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,000
picture of Tasmania which I should have

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,830
put in this steep side but I didn't keep

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,740
going if you're interested you should go

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,929
on this ferry dot org slash Tiger so

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,679
it's a very interesting Python project

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,750
run by NASA

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,090
they're obviously under source they half

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,440
the site doesn't work because the NASA

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:46,210
wouldn't allow it through the firewall

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,100
anyway next I'm in over my head I think

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,580
that's probably pretty obvious we are

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,280
running

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,550
Tomcat we're running Apache we were

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:59,270
running Apache with a mod was eating not

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:01,220
very well at the moment I am I think is

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,540
what we should get together as some

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,580
people should come and help me tomorrow

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,230
I'm here tomorrow for that sprinting

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,820
thing I'm hoping somebody will come and

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,320
tap me on the head and beat me senseless

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,420
and actually make a few of these things

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,410
work for me when the ideas are good

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,250
the audience is good but the execution

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,070
is shocking I got trained as a sysadmin

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,620
and I really I'm really good as sysadmin

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,300
mostly I can get that my school working

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:26,660
I'm having a bit more trouble with that

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,850
with that Tomcat thing okay and when

00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,110
people say yes it's it's a it's very

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,400
straightforward it just works

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,020
I don't believe them anymore and this

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,450
yeah you've got to be a specialist to

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,860
get some of this stuff to go and so if

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,930
there's some specialist out there they

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,640
can help me I'd really love particularly

00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,050
I don't care where you are in fact if

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,700
you're a foreign language speaker that's

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,560
even better as these people who aren't

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,360
working with we've got this they've been

00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,280
talking to people in sub-saharan Africa

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,280
right and they all want

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:06,440
thank you very okay so on the lectern on

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:10,470
this side up next would be David Beaty

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,820
and on this side up next we have resale

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,880
small who's going to be talking about

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:20,430
flask analytics

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,410
your time startsnow whoo awesome okay so

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,550
first kind of Linux and a few other

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,890
things that have been on my mind

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,200
anyway I'm resource more I work for

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:32,880
Heroku quick show of hands who's

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,540
deployed flask awesome Jango cool and

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,130
rails come on

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,300
show hands okay that's good Kenneth's

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:47,300
got his hand up anyway variety is

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,290
important especially for Kenneth hmm so

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,150
quick know last night came to the

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:56,790
conclusion that a buffet is a lot like a

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:58,140
worker cure like this well yeah except

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,240
there was one problem not one of my

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,580
co-workers has ever run out of chocolate

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,010
cake nothing it seriously disappointing

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,750
so we're thinkers we're innovators we

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:17,190
are changing the world and we have ideas

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:18,240
I thought this was genius anyway it's

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,860
hard to keep up with the changing

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,270
methods of writing code as well I mean

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,720
look at this guess what it actually

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:29,910
works

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,590
anyway flask analytics flask is awesome

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,600
extensible and it's easy

00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,059
this is flask analytics written about a

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,950
month ago it's very easy to install this

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,799
is the code to get it up and running as

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,130
you can see a few lines so this collects

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,230
a lot of data we've got the URL this

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,780
session date/time you know some people

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,250
people might think it's over the top but

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,450
it captures every request there's no

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,740
JavaScript on the front end no Google

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,620
Analytics is nothing like that

00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:04,919
and if since I started to remote

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:06,660
controller for viewing it's all wrapped

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:14,250
up in a nice before request hook and

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:17,880
it's documented exactly what it does it

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:20,940
uses existing Python packages so fairly

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,650
low dependencies and this package is

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,850
young it you know the community is

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,160
listening they're getting involved with

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:35,070
it actually the community's talking at

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:37,710
the moment anyway this was the first

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:42,270
issue that popped up you know there's

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,250
genuine concerns about this you know

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,730
when we're not sending data to prison

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,320
there's synchronous i/o issues so there

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,980
was a recommendation made to fix that up

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,240
but you know it's hard being a BF DL you

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,380
know you've got to include these changes

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,210
you've got to take these concerns on

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,210
board and really they were cost to this

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:13,950
anyway the community provides great

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:15,720
suggestions then there was this so it

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,640
was decided the synchronous i/o was the

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,880
way to go

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,600
regardless open-source equals freedom

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,960
giggle Cheers

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,960
thank you

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,440
we will make sure that we do not send

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,790
your lightning talk to the NSA can't

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:50,020
speak for the DSD though we know you're

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:53,350
here so on this lectern over here jacob

00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,900
kaplan moss please and on my right hand

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,640
side we have david beachy who's going to

00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,679
be talking about a python grab bag

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,170
opinions for the uh opinionated your

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,020
time starts now

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:07,090
hi my name is david bailey this is a

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,890
grab bag of python tools that i find

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,690
useful that i work with

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,210
here's some information about myself

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:15,550
very pythonic i'm from Townsville North

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,900
Queensland I am very very very cold

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:22,150
right now I work in with web integration

00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,650
and development various different

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,420
technologies and lots of different open

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,309
source you can find me on github and

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,440
Twitter and the shameless plug is I'm

00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:31,720
setting up it's been a year now but it's

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,309
getting there a Python North Queensland

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,250
users group so is anyone from North

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:41,290
Queensland really don't dental sing out

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:43,150
once fantastic well anyway freely yes

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,040
yes fantastic but anyway if you know

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,929
someone in in North Queensland can

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,130
stands for the region who works with

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:53,440
Python or is interested given my details

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,809
right okay so help I need to do

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,760
something in Python good news there's

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:00,160
tons of Python packages on the package

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,220
index bad news there's tons of packages

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,590
on the Python package index there and as

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,690
of yesterday this is almost 32 and a

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,970
half thousand packages so what do we do

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,070
what do we do with that we need to look

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,870
through this and find learn good tools

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,230
unfortunately I'm not going to sit there

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:20,220
and go through all of the packaged index

00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,540
because that's going to take forever and

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,460
so effectively the best way that I found

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,720
is I come to talk like this and listen

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,790
to what you guys have to say so thank

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,710
you for that and here are a couple of

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,570
things that I've used one of which is

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:36,940
this meme generator is the meme package

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,740
and that's it tada um for those of you

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,480
who want to you know just to do it

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,240
that's it you can go ahead and buy them

00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,309
and I think fen static natural dogpile

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,270
cache is a fantastic band name so these

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,660
are the packages that we're going to

00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:53,330
gonna step through right now so start

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,830
with a library called natural it's I'm

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,299
disclaimer I haven't written any of

00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,510
these things but I have contributed to

00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:02,059
them and fixed number of different bugs

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,130
and so forth but yeah so natural is a

00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,380
library for converting raw values into

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,510
human format so for instance you might

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,900
take in that can deal with dates Delta

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,210
time Delta's durations file time sizes

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,030
through puts numbers all sorts and it

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,970
can even turn turn words into morse code

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:22,429
for instance and so you can see here you

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,380
can take huge numbers number dot word in

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,450
this library for instance massive long

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,160
number and it produces some output that

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,150
I've never even heard of who's heard of

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,770
that that suffix there no idea but yeah

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,270
so effectively there's all these helpers

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,070
powerful methods that can take your raw

00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,850
data and display it in something that's

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:42,940
helpful for for your users to read and

00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:47,690
it's perfect for log cats that speak

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,790
speak Morse code huh so yeah so check

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,000
out check out natural it's easy to

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:55,910
install and no dependencies on that one

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,679
for caching for second one so we'll step

00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,830
through this pretty quickly but there'll

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,380
be links on the end of the slides for

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,340
caching for instance dog pal cache is

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,440
one that I've used

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,590
it's a successor to vacation part or

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,440
become it it's able to use decorators

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,510
cache regions have customizable

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,580
expiration times per different functions

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,290
and so forth and uses a-gettin create

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,419
pattern so you might have similar things

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,860
in other frameworks and so forth this is

00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:24,290
just one thing that I've used I use it

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,559
with pyramid but it can work with

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:30,770
whatever interpretation backends you can

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,660
use memcache Redis any DM Ram so more or

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,150
less here you go you take some input

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,030
it's very nasty they're confusing and

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:43,010
returns the ultimate answer which is

00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:45,530
clearly six by nine in terms of so web

00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:47,950
resources fan static is a fun library to

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,409
to work with so effectively it builds on

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,760
packaged JavaScript and CSS resources

00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:54,230
somebody packages these up and you can

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,800
just include them like at the normal

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,690
dependency

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,670
you set up dot pie file gives you same

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,500
versioning gives you a URL generation

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,970
bundling minification and everything

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,530
like that and there's about a hundred or

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:08,090
so packages in the jas namespace so far

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,340
in terms of integration it integrates

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,200
with any wsgi application python

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,970
frameworks a lot sort of thing there and

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,330
there you go so the Knights who say

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:22,040
actually ekke ekke and followed the

00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:24,650
reston me no not near you not anymore

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:28,280
so yes so the idea is learn everything

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:31,550
effectively but more or less well still

00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,900
more time great fantastic more time so

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,490
anyway so some more tools that I've

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,100
worked with talking to some people about

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,260
tile stash runs in Python serves maps

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,510
out combine it with a very fantastic

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,490
tool called tile mill and you can see

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,820
maps up using CSS and become your own

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,620
Google Maps competitor you WSGI is an

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,320
application container serves everything

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,570
from Python Java Ruby pearl Erlang and

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,970
more that I don't even know about and in

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,880
my experience it's about you know 25%

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,800
faster a protocol than HTTP and some

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,910
more there too so yeah check out and

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,910
that's the sign

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,479
okay so next up on my right will be Matt

00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:15,450
Oakes so if you can come to set up and

00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:17,609
on my left we have jacob kaplan moss

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:21,090
who's going to be talking about pip

00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,559
install python nation your time starts

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,419
now

00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,580
so i wonder if anyone's running this

00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,019
right now to install python nation um a

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,789
lot of times when you discover a new a

00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,249
new python package it sits like this

00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:33,960
someone influential like alex gainer

00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,519
tweets out that there's a cool thing you

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,529
should check out python nation and so

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,839
you so you try it you type in salt by

00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:41,940
foundation I think I hear people typing

00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,279
right now so let's talk about what

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,070
happens when you type pip install Python

00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,629
Nation well so pip uses the Python

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,299
package index so it's gonna go to a

00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:54,089
particular URL pipe ID up python.org

00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:56,549
slash pi PI slash Python nation that's

00:30:54,089 --> 00:31:02,629
the package and it's going to discover

00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:06,869
there a link to a file to a tar GZ file

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:08,369
you can see authors me I put it up there

00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:10,440
as of this afternoon about a hundred

00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,839
people downloaded this kind of

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,359
interesting and so the next step that

00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,129
pip is gonna do is if effectively what I

00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,409
put up here I've simplified to some

00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:22,049
extent but pip is going to download this

00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:25,799
this file which is just a normal tar

00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:28,619
ball gzip tar ball of stuff it's gonna

00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,839
unpack that file go into the directory

00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,609
that it unpacked and run Python set up

00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,809
dot pi install and that's gonna spit out

00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:39,269
a bunch of stuff at at some point let's

00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,210
see we make an egg we add Python nation

00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:45,779
to the easy install past file why do we

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,099
still call it this we this is gonna be

00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,419
funny we're gonna be years from now no

00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,389
one's gonna know what easy and solid is

00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:54,719
it it's still gonna be there well

00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:58,109
there's an interesting thing here - set

00:31:54,719 --> 00:32:01,499
up that PI install I mean think about

00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:03,330
this what we just did is we we work type

00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:07,649
to command it downloaded some code from

00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:09,239
the internet and ran it does this make

00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:11,429
anyone a little bit uncomfortable

00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:13,200
well you shouldn't be uncomfortable it's

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,599
just a simple setup script if this is I

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,870
popped open setup that pie in my and my

00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,940
install in my

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:23,050
senator and it's it's just a little tiny

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,670
little setup script um look at that

00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,890
scrollbar it's kind of something

00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,080
interesting here let's turn them let's

00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:33,820
turn our soft rap on so we can see

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,750
what's going on ooh this is getting a

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,830
little uncomfortable

00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:41,490
um exact and y-you know if it's running

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:45,100
code why would I possibly have wanted to

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,210
gzip and compress it and base64 encode

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,380
it so that you couldn't tell what's

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:52,990
going on well before I reveal the trick

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:57,520
let me tell you what I didn't do when

00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:59,559
you ran pip install Python nation I did

00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,950
not send out Facebook updates on your

00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:05,590
behalf I did not look for incriminating

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,179
photos and post them online you know

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,860
there's actually a nakedness detection

00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:10,720
algorithm it's there's been a number of

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,420
papers on this so this is not as I as

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,260
difficult as you might think I didn't

00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:21,010
steal your private keys I didn't remove

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,870
your hard drive and I considered gold

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:26,380
only decided not to take a picture of

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,630
you I really thought about that I was

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,950
really tempted there's a way on OS 10 to

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,220
take a picture without turning the

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:34,480
little green light on so here's what

00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,450
this script actually does if you

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,059
decompress it I get your login name I

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,850
get your host I take a hash of Etsy

00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,860
password I chose that file carefully

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,270
because it's probably on all of your

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,830
computers but it's not actually that

00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,520
dangerous it's not actually that big a

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:54,010
deal and I sent it to a little a little

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,080
app that I wrote just take a look here

00:33:54,010 --> 00:34:02,250
real quick and see how many people have

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,250
joined the Python nation

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:27,230
so rut Russ's computer is the hammer so

00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:29,540
um let's hello mm okay so how scared are

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,929
we is this guy falling is this a big

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,250
deal well it's not that big a deal to

00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:36,440
some extent you're always running

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,360
someone else's code when you download

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,490
code this isn't pips fault this isn't PI

00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,050
PI's fault wheels will help this a

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,960
little bit but you're still running

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:47,570
someone else's code you just ran code

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,540
because Alex told you to because I told

00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:53,330
you to on a slide this will never

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,800
actually be fixed right we're never

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,260
gonna change this when you pip install

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,230
Django you're trusting that Django is

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,660
what it claims to be so if this scares

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,280
you and for some values of you I think

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,870
it will then you need to host your own

00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,080
packages you need to download them

00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:11,630
locally audit them by eye check that

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,540
they're not sending things to certainly

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:17,270
not sending things to prism and then

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,970
save save and cache them locally here

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,470
are two very good local package servers

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,770
that you can use for this and I hope

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,770
you're well

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:36,750
okay so next up on my left will be Dylan

00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:40,350
lacy and to present on my right Drock

00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:45,840
ass please welcome Matt Oaks hi that's

00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:47,970
now hi um I'm also responding to Alex's

00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,970
keynote yesterday morning where he

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,290
invoked art as one of the potential

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,350
pillars of the software development

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:59,640
profession but I thought he dealt with

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:02,520
it quite quite a scant level now I've

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,710
done a bit of University study in art

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,050
I've been a designer and are now

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,880
developer so I thought perhaps I'm in a

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:12,210
position to kind of unpack some of the

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,930
more relevant ideas for all of you and

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:18,630
perhaps it'll give you some of the tools

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:21,090
to help you understand what parts of

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:25,970
what you do cross over into the realm of

00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:31,400
art so what goes on in an artist's mind

00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:37,470
how do we know if something we do is art

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:40,320
how do you do it who knows but quite

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:45,420
likely you're not actually doing art per

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,370
se you're doing something like art so

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,920
art as a artist driven completely

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,920
freeform thing I've certainly got some

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,450
projects are doing my spare time which

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,220
fall into that category design is more

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,810
but same kind of problem solving at work

00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,800
when there's a definite problem to

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,570
address but underneath it all on an

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,760
everyday basis no matter what problem

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:13,110
you're solving is creativity and that is

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,240
what makes us different from the

00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:19,260
computers we could otherwise program

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:23,760
ourselves away does everyone know what

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:27,210
that is he might have been taking the

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:33,260
piss but it made a very big splash in

00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:36,750
the 1917 Paris exhibition of high art

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,120
and it proved that art is more than just

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,520
aesthetics it really works in the realm

00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,070
of ideas

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,650
and the other major advance in art of

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,690
course which I don't have time to cover

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:53,270
really is it moved beyond the object

00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:56,810
about fifty years later the object

00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:58,280
became unnecessary so the the best

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,290
theoreticians were grappling with this

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,850
for a long time though that's almost 50

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:06,620
years after the fountain and at Verona

00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,330
heart the best he had to say it was art

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:13,370
is not what art is I can't even say it

00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:18,020
exactly exactly

00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:20,000
try programming that so you get into

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,730
more into what is art the models have

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,590
improved over time donald brooke has a

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:28,370
australian guy who has written some very

00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:31,310
influential books and these are some of

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,800
his ideas taken from that book a very

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:36,140
interesting one to me that art is the

00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,910
root of language like before there were

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,070
words and anything written down there

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:46,880
were paintings and images and sounds and

00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:49,670
music and mysticism so that's an

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,790
interesting underpinning and then some

00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,400
basic rules for what constitutes art

00:38:51,790 --> 00:39:02,480
sorry about my markdown not not

00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:04,160
rendering properly there and so to make

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,300
it bring it back to what's relevant to

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,810
you people what I want to give you an

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:15,440
art lecture you know is any art actually

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:18,560
like software and a lot is conceptual

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,390
art was very big in the late 60s people

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,330
were paying big money for these crazy

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:27,200
ideas and essentially they were just

00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:30,260
programs just a like an idea that you'd

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,390
run in your head and go WOW one of my

00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,200
favorite ones the artist invoked a cubic

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,850
mile of air above your head but then

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,100
that was at the moment where he

00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,870
instantiated it and then after that it's

00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,950
those particular molecules as they

00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:48,440
dispersed it was beautiful

00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:52,340
so just to convey an idea or a concept

00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,170
to the perceiver but essentially it's a

00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,560
program and that's led on to a general

00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,920
you've art there's a very nice website

00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,450
there with some great links to all kinds

00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,960
of stuff but essentially they're the

00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,880
artist puts in trainer process and the

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,720
output of the process is recognized as

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,570
art hopefully there's a lot of research

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,750
to get to do in there the most popular

00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:22,880
thing is processing which is based on

00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:24,710
Java but there's plenty of Python going

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,340
on as well it's very good for artists

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:32,510
and so this is what underpins the

00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,210
underpins the body of knowledge really

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:39,350
on conceptual oh it's at my time you've

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:51,590
got to read that yeah that's time thank

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:52,910
you yes so so I am going to get my

00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,460
stopwatch back up and running

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:58,490
yeah thank you so much Wow we work on

00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:02,570
getting the holiday back so on my right

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,760
up next is going to be ducky and on my

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,860
left to tell us about testing iOS apps

00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,570
with appium Dylan Lacey

00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:15,470
your time starts now hi comp icon so who

00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:17,570
wants to be cool we're not cool we do

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,450
Python we do Ruby that's not cool iOS is

00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:23,540
cool we want to do i OS there's a

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,860
problem so there's a tool called appium

00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,960
appium is what happens when you combine

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,020
selenium the browser automation tool

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,550
with iOS selenium is a framework for

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,250
automating browsers you can use real

00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,230
browsers like your real user so it

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,550
functions like real user and it can run

00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:42,200
locally or remotely there's a problem is

00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,620
that iOS isn't a browser how is this

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,660
gonna work

00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,210
so now you've app controls are kind of

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,890
like web controls you have fields you

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,830
have buttons you scroll you click you

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,940
slide you assert on tests you cert on

00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,260
content and you probably want to

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,780
automate your tests because doing it

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,700
manually makes you want to cry so web

00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,980
testing is like this rubyists Rubeus

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,180
love testing - list love testing iOS

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,180
people do this

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,740
what testing tools exactly so how does

00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,740
this work how can you test on iOS well

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,569
appium is a framework for selenium your

00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,390
test is in that diamonds all our tests

00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,920
look like diamonds then selenium talks

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,690
the remote protocol to a p.m. which

00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,579
functions as a server which uses

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,549
instrument CAS which is a node protocol

00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,190
see we're getting cooler by the second

00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:34,619
which talks the Apple iOS emulator so

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,910
you probably think I'm lying this is

00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,280
what it looks like to set a session up

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,319
mostly you tell it what your webdriver

00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,359
is the selenium webdriver remote you

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,319
tell it where your server lives and then

00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,000
you give it a set of desired

00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:48,510
capabilities which they give me a remote

00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,369
server that functions much like this so

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,319
for instance you can find values by

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,690
calling the the selenium methods find me

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,640
a tag that's called table cell make sure

00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:00,990
that it's name is equal to buttons

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,760
variations of UI button you can interact

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,290
with them by flipping switches on and

00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,270
off you can see their value changes you

00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,280
can get values by tag you can send keys

00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,390
to things you can scroll up and down

00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,510
it's very exciting

00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,000
so a demo now appium is an open-source

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,960
product you download it then you don't

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,559
find it when you're trying to give a

00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,960
talk oh there we go that's what that

00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,150
film looks like now after um it's

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,619
running everybody's wins this is what

00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,390
our test looks like it's a standard PI

00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:36,780
unit test I'm not going to go through it

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:40,680
because I don't have enough time hi - UI

00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:43,140
catalog UI catalog is a app that simply

00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,150
shows you what you can do with the Apple

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,069
hue eye and it's running in the

00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,869
background because that's the best thing

00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:51,420
it could be doing there we go so our

00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:53,250
test is now operating this app and like

00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,140
a good test it's stopping and going back

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,460
to the start over and over again which

00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:58,230
may not be that visually interesting I

00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,030
apologize the Ruby version is not a good

00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,630
test but it looks better but I thought I

00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:05,730
would show you in the Python version so

00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,010
it's it's running through things as a

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,980
user would it's typing in the the Apple

00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,780
emulator it's running assertions you can

00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,059
see in the background there the the

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,980
server itself is running and at the end

00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,700
of it our console output will tell us

00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,800
where

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,420
the test succeeded or not appium also

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,290
works for Android it works on real

00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,240
devices it works remotely or locally if

00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,400
you want to use iOS there are two

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,430
options the first one is you have one of

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:41,130
these and the second option is you use

00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:43,740
one of these we have a Mac cloud that

00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,300
allows you to do iOS testy stuff if your

00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,970
open source project you get free access

00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,170
to our stuff forever and I have some

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,490
free minutes to give away to all of you

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,840
at the end of my presentation as well

00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:57,450
unless they run out of time in which

00:44:51,840 --> 00:45:01,050
case you don't get free stuff five sec

00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,670
no all right you can host remotely you

00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,270
can connect them to a grid you can run

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:09,830
in parallel that's really cool and you

00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,850
can pay someone else to bother seconds I

00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:13,200
added a gift because the last time I

00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,500
gave this talk everybody else had

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,030
animated gifts and I felt very alone but

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,670
yeah thanks for listening the appium

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,260
site is a PMD or if you use the keyword

00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,490
Fjords when signing up for source labs

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,350
you'll get a thousand seven hundred and

00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:28,620
fifty minutes so if you don't have a Mac

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:31,710
you can do a round with um iOS Android

00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,910
automation and appium kind of stuff hit

00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,800
me up on Twitter if you have questions

00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,800
or Dylan hats or slabs calm thank you

00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:48,489
Rubi people getting up onstage and

00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:50,079
telling us we're not cool yeah yeah yeah

00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:52,869
but you know at least you speak half the

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,380
truth okay

00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:59,049
so on my left will be mark Pesce and the

00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,900
rest of the Morse cloud type people on

00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:04,299
my right is duckie who is gonna be talk

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,109
telling us all about comp con you time

00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:10,049
starts now

00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:12,069
hi I'm doc II um Comic Con basically

00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:13,630
computing students you may have been

00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,739
computing students you may be computing

00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,630
students you may have never been the

00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:18,729
computing student in your life but hey

00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,999
computing students could be the future

00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:23,559
of computing we kind of hope a bit so

00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:24,819
we've decided that they might need a

00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,339
national conference for computing

00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:29,529
students law students have them lots of

00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:32,259
other faculties have them so we decided

00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:34,029
we might run our own um I'm duckie

00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:37,269
I'm a Utah's student here I study

00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:39,400
computing in science double degree yay

00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:41,439
I'm also the president of tux which is

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,619
the computing Society here and I was

00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:46,359
contacted by some lovely people of the

00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:50,169
ANU computer science students

00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,569
association last year at 3:00 a.m. when

00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:54,459
I was studying for exams and they

00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:56,229
decided and well we talked for a while

00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:57,849
and we were like hey it would be awesome

00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:58,839
if we could get all the computing

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:01,479
students from all the different

00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:03,099
universities to come and not exactly

00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,869
have a party but maybe a few parties and

00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:06,299
like a conference like this one and talk

00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:08,859
about things that we're learning about

00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:11,199
and what we should be learning about

00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,849
because a lot of people think that

00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,869
computing isn't taught as well as it

00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:15,219
should be and there are a lot of

00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,479
different ways to teach it and we

00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:19,179
thought we should have a conference to

00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,769
discuss ways that we the students might

00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:22,739
like to be taught like things we want to

00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:26,140
learn that aren't currently being taught

00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,329
so that's what comic-con is for but we

00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,459
are currently looking for speakers and I

00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,739
know for a fact there are some fantastic

00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:34,569
speakers out there I've heard lots of

00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:36,369
you talk so I'm kind of hoping that

00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:39,069
telling you guys about this might make

00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,499
you interested in coming and speaking at

00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:43,390
comic-con we're also looking for papers

00:47:41,499 --> 00:47:45,969
we also have a careers fair so we're

00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:49,479
looking for any people who want to set

00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:50,710
up a stall and kind of in darks new

00:47:49,479 --> 00:47:52,300
students to come

00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,280
work for them because there are some

00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,290
really talented ones out there sponsors

00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,780
are nice too we have a few sponsors at

00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,520
the moment and we're actually fine as it

00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:05,260
is for money but you know what's always

00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:07,599
good and of course like the most

00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,970
important thing we need is students and

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,730
that's because it's a conference and all

00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:16,450
the students know duckie I'm happy for

00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:18,670
you I'm gonna let you finish but I got a

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:23,109
few tips there's gonna be the best

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:25,119
lightning talk of all time okay so this

00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:27,640
is how to write overview slides for fun

00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,570
and profit okay so what you know what

00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,089
you need and what I'm gonna be talking

00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,740
about today is why you need them why

00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:33,970
they're useful how to make them and how

00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,920
to make them entertaining then how to

00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,990
make them fun and then how to make those

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,920
things and worthwhile and then what

00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,359
we're gonna talk about is how it's

00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,710
what's appropriate to put in there and

00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:43,780
what's not appropriate to put in there

00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,980
then I'll go through a summary is you so

00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,900
the first section why do you need

00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,000
overview slides it's so that people know

00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,339
how long they will be bored for so

00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,020
people have it's also people have time

00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:55,000
to finish tweeting before your

00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,470
presentation starts it's very important

00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,700
and it gives a reason to sit here for

00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:01,119
you to skim through the bulk of your

00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:04,839
presentation so oh these slides are very

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,430
useful and annoying people and for

00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,170
repeating things you've already said and

00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,580
for a pitying things we've already said

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,730
but as well as repeating things are

00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,500
about to say or you've already said so

00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,670
I'll talk about a little bit now hum how

00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,320
to make them because that's important as

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:22,060
well so you start with a list of things

00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:24,310
you're covering your talk so list and

00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:26,200
then what you do is you load it into a

00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,850
blender and you don't put the lid on

00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,470
that's stupid you wait for the topics

00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,510
just to fly out but then you realize

00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:34,000
that was a stupid idea because now you

00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:37,150
need to make another list of the

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,970
original content so things that are

00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:43,270
appropriate to put in other view slides

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:46,120
section headers and detailed section

00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:48,460
headers things that you'll definitely

00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,050
say again because studies have shown

00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,490
that humans learn better if you repeat

00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,550
everything twice in a row without

00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,210
pausing studies have shown that humans

00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,970
learn better

00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:00,520
so things that aren't appropriate to put

00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:04,420
an overview slides are pictures unless

00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,630
your talk is only pictures in which you

00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:12,850
have an overview of in pictures so but

00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:15,160
anything that is in words don't wait

00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:17,500
wait okay so I'm gonna go through a

00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,890
summary with you so what I've been

00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:23,830
through so far is why you needed a view

00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,840
slides why they were useful to you how

00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:28,000
you would go about making them what's

00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:32,380
appropriate to put in there and then and

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,410
then a bit of a summary at the end um so

00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,280
I have a list of references and if you

00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,070
would actually like to go to that

00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:45,700
website you'll find a lot about about my

00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:50,230
my talk so so next time you I'll

00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:53,230
probably give something like this that

00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:55,570
is also a very important topic and how

00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:58,780
to read your slides with a back to the

00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:01,780
audience and it's so people can't hear

00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,460
okay so but that's also a very important

00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,540
thing you should probably talk to ducky

00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:08,370
a little bit more about that I'm just

00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,370
gonna I'm just going to go home

00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:15,490
Thank You Jackie and thank you Nick I

00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,740
think I almost just about have enough

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,270
time to rewrite the entirety the the

00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,200
conference closed thank you for all the

00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:24,760
tips about presenting I had no idea

00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,650
that's a lot more people than mark Pesce

00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,560
are you able to run your own timer or

00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:33,130
should I oh okay well wait we're gonna

00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,380
have you on the honor system and okay

00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:37,540
and out your time starts now

00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,090
thank you excellent you sir yes um we

00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,830
ran a hackathon down in what does it

00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,180
Waterloo or the heck it was all day long

00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,560
and people came by and did the most

00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,390
amazing things I just want to show off a

00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,980
couple of them the first of them is that

00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,240
you saw the content timer yesterday it

00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,620
was running in JavaScript someone

00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,930
recoded it in pure Python who was a

00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:54,370
basically newbie Python programmer but

00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:58,230
I'm gonna give it to David who had never

00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,230
programmed in Python before today right

00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:05,620
guys this is my first Python program bar

00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,690
one the first one was a thing that used

00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,700
the Fibonacci sequence to drive this

00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,100
randomly what you're looking at

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,870
currently is the CPU activity of each of

00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:17,830
my CPUs on this machine

00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,790
Green is cb1 the blue is CPU - and hang

00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,590
on a second I'll see if I can open

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:26,680
something stupid like oh I don't know

00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:28,900
Xcode I just happen to have Xcode here

00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,140
I'm what a thing listen up there you go

00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,390
so when the two were sides collide you

00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:37,230
get red and that's buried Thank You

00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,230
that'll do Cheers

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,330
all right I'm feeling you to platen as

00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,740
well so I was messing around took me

00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:51,160
about an hour to work out how to use

00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:53,140
time functions so I made a basic clock

00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:58,060
so I've encoded hours minutes and

00:52:53,140 --> 00:53:05,440
seconds in the first maybe eight of

00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:07,720
these lights I forgot to call you up um

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,000
except that that wasn't a very good use

00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,350
of it because it's only using the eight

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,490
of those lights so I made another one

00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:17,080
which I called red versus blue and how

00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,660
this one works is you've got red and

00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:22,630
blue kind of game of lifestyle things

00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,280
they fight at jobs of the death we

00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:28,240
decided in the end out communists

00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,910
because they tended to lose um but then

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,910
we've decided that was bad and it went

00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,530
on but anyway we thought was pretty fun

00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:39,490
next person

00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:41,619
hi man that was awesome

00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:47,290
okay I'm going to mostly let this one

00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:51,359
talk for itself is the old audio coming

00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,359
through yeah mute

00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,900
the hardest thing was using high audio

00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,880
to get big

00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,100
Bienvenue well originally was from the

00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,440
microphone and then I did some echo as

00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,440
stuff to watching template but anyway

00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:36,310
so I did some stuff in Python then I

00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,850
decided to use a real language like

00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,670
objective-c

00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:42,100
and what I've made is a really simple

00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:44,620
iPhone application that lets you paint

00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:48,600
directly onto the holiday so I'm gonna

00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:51,550
drew a little bit this and with that and

00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,290
when I decide that my art is not really

00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:55,000
art because it's not really freeform and

00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,980
creative I can just do a little flick of

00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,960
my wrist and the whole thing goes away

00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,910
so yeah basically this is a nice little

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,410
demonstration for giving to people

00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,330
saying hey this is what the whole they

00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:11,770
can do and I can do all kinds of

00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:13,630
painting with it so yeah and we'll be

00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:18,940
doing a sprint using iOS and more of

00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:21,610
this tomorrow so please join us before

00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,540
you go mark gave us a really good dinner

00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:27,790
keynote yesterday

00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:31,900
and so here is your Python Australia

00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:39,730
2013 coffee mug and a bag of Norwegian

00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:44,380
blue to put in it next up on my left

00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:46,450
will be Brett Wilkins on my right we now

00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,460
have Evan Bromley who is going to be

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:52,150
telling us about Python and the

00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:58,600
PlayStation Move time starts now

00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:59,380
good is that right all right awesome all

00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,880
right so this is something I've been

00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,370
sort of playing with over the last year

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,180
I was sort of inspired by if anyone

00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:08,590
knows your hunt Sebastian joust there's

00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,390
been a lot of sort of people playing

00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:15,070
around with this and there's actually a

00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:16,510
really good public public API that you

00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:20,920
can use to play with it so I figured I

00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:23,260
just introduced introduced it so I've

00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,820
also named this building the world's

00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,090
first restful interface winter pretty

00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,090
dance

00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:33,500
because that's I suppose possible all

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,440
right so a brief introduced introduction

00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,470
so these are the controllers they have

00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,049
the Bluetooth they have a standard sort

00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:45,049
of USB port on the bottom three acts at

00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:46,940
concealer Amida 3-axis gyroscope there

00:56:45,049 --> 00:56:48,049
are three LEDs in the ball so you can

00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,579
produce any color you want

00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:53,000
so that basically using the same sort of

00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:55,670
stuff as these Rumble they have an

00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,160
analogue trigger on the back stacks with

00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,420
buttons and if you look around you can

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,299
buy them for about 25 bucks

00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,010
so admitted they're amazingly cheap you

00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:05,809
can also write up to seven from one PC

00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,940
on one Bluetooth connection I don't know

00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:12,170
if any was actually ported the the PS

00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:13,910
Move API to Raspberry Pi but if you did

00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,589
that you could hook up seven of these to

00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:17,420
one of those and do something really

00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:20,750
interesting

00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:26,030
so the PS Move API it's available those

00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:27,799
URLs it's a pretty interesting thing I

00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:31,309
mean it was originally designed for your

00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:32,450
hands Sebastian just so the guys who are

00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:35,569
sort of designing that with you guys who

00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:37,520
originally wrote the code and it's also

00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:39,950
being used if anyone that doesn't seem

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,250
to Bastion Jeff it involves it's

00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:45,319
basically a very slow motion just there

00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,549
he can't the idea is you're not supposed

00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:48,079
to set off the accelerometer in your

00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:54,140
device but you want other people to set

00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:55,400
off theirs and so there's there's a

00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,780
music that goes that plays over your

00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,369
hands and Bastion bark in the background

00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,720
that varies in tempo and if it's going

00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:01,670
fast then you can move faster it's going

00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,920
slow you have to move slow they've also

00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:08,859
done one called done one called Edgar

00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:11,720
ice froze her which involves twenty

00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:14,119
PlayStation moves on a network hanging

00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,280
from roof the idea being that you have a

00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:18,950
color at all times you have to be

00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:22,640
holding the trigger of a PS Move of your

00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:24,740
color so it's kind of like a big game of

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,230
Twister

00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:30,300
right so the PS move is written in C it

00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,980
has pretty good Python bindings via

00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,200
sweet which is sort of converts the C

00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,710
API to a baked guy whatever else you

00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,660
want and it'll take you an evening to

00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:42,150
install it's kind of interesting you'll

00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,650
probably learn something about C make if

00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,940
anyone else does you see make it's

00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:51,090
probably a good thing not to learn

00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:52,290
things about but you will so I was sort

00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,140
of think about this last night I went I

00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:58,830
saw max max talk last night and I

00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,030
thought well these are things and it was

00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,410
11 o'clock last night and I got we've

00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,930
got to act it's my hotel our meals like

00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,800
well I might as well make something so

00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,330
if you look at the github repository

00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,440
you'll see that the initial commit to

00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:13,020
that 3m last night anyway I've created

00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,850
thing called PS Move restful which is

00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,800
basically a restful interface to the

00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:20,670
PlayStation Move controllers I give this

00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:23,340
flask flask restful a PS Move API so

00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:27,930
I'll just figure cross to my code which

00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:31,050
is disappeared there we go

00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:35,630
so she'll bring up there's a better idea

00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:39,180
browser so here's these two controllers

00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:40,800
in a restful interface see if I press

00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:44,040
down the trigger you should see the

00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,540
trigger all of them turn to true CBT NT

00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,330
has gone to true and the accelerometer

00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,280
should be changing if I put it upside

00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:53,880
down you'll see a Y goes to negative one

00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,130
I put it up to top it goes up to one and

00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,300
you can query this however you like so

00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:03,120
I've got a terminal open here I've been

01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:06,120
pushing for things with requests so I've

01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:14,420
set up a URL with just localhost /

01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:14,420
controller / 0 red oops

01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:24,200
slightly less read let's make it also

01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:25,520
add some green into the mix that's air

01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,020
so that's yellow because it's it's red

01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,100
as well I can make it Rumble as well but

01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,230
I'm gonna run out of time

01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:32,680
see I could probably let's try that just

01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,680
quickly

01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,890
there you go

01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:55,170
okay so up last on my right will be Tim

01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,000
Ansel so if you could come and set up

01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:59,369
and on my left

01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,530
Bret Wilkins read this your time

01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:03,750
startsnow

01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:05,700
all right this is gonna be really quick

01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:08,280
so yeah having a favorite language is

01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:10,770
really cool - was my favorite language

01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,950
was my first dynamic language brothers

01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:15,180
haven't seen my talk earlier today be

01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,900
limiting yourself to that one language

01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:19,710
isn't so cool

01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,800
somewhere out of place but read this

01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:26,520
book practic protocol are inter design

01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,470
in Ruby and a job primer it's basically

01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,020
encompasses a whole lot of agile stuff

01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:33,540
and also of course object-oriented

01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,700
design it does say Ruby but you can

01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:37,560
always rip out the Ruby stuff and just

01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,470
think in Python if you really want to do

01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,310
that

01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:43,380
this was actually original thing I was

01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:47,430
going to try and talk about but that

01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:50,040
would only be one slide and so the risk

01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:54,270
of what I've got to say is Troy Ruby if

01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:55,920
you really want try go lang I hear a lot

01:01:54,270 --> 01:02:00,450
of Python people like go Lang when they

01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:03,599
try it it is quite like Python in some

01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,670
ways unlike in others but you'll

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:11,000
probably enjoy it

01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:11,000
try rust try closure try something else

01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:17,880
sort of make you know try something this

01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:20,670
is not really object-oriented try

01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:22,109
something functional try something try

01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:31,700
aspect-oriented programming if you find

01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:31,700
something do that try Prolog thank you

01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:39,859
and our last light lightning talk is

01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:43,339
going to be presented by Tim and Saul

01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:44,930
time starts now um this isn't part of my

01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:46,999
let you talk but if you want a lightning

01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:49,009
timer there was lightning turn it up net

01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:50,329
but that's down you can use this now not

01:02:49,009 --> 01:02:55,009
everybody has fancy lights

01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:57,249
I think Python was pretty awesome who

01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:57,249
agrees

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:07,999
sadly my Khan is pretty much over unless

01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:09,229
you want to come to the sprints and now

01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:14,410
I'm going to be lazy and have somebody

01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:14,410
talk for me sound

01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:26,300
if you haven't been to you should

01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,800
definitely and make sure you stay for

01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,990
the next one the Sprint's are great

01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,120
because they don't just let you put a

01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,000
face to a name now you put a person suit

01:03:32,120 --> 01:04:09,790
ideas

01:03:34,000 --> 01:04:11,710
I was captured at PyCon us I think the

01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:13,840
Sprint's here just going to be even

01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,150
awesomer so you should definitely be

01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:22,960
staying if you're not I recommend

01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:25,120
changing your flights so Pike on a use a

01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,760
line it's Australia event if you haven't

01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:29,950
heard Chris repeated multiple times

01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,920
likes Australia does other things it's

01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:34,960
kind of got an irrelevant name it's more

01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,120
an open source Australia thing but

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,270
because of history it ended up named

01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,670
clients Australia so it runs our

01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:43,570
conferences like stuff they use they're

01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,800
really big one

01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,770
which is where it kind of got its name

01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,510
from again this is more an open source

01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:51,670
conference rather than a line X only

01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,670
conference there's a huge number of

01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:56,950
Python developers there OpenStack was

01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:59,290
really big last year so if you went tome

01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:00,970
step Unicom I think that opens that mini

01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,760
cot for LCA as well so they seem to be

01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:05,020
everywhere now

01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:08,200
they also have a whole bunch of PHP

01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:11,890
stuff if you're sadly doing that like

01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,360
Drupal downunder web camps Joomla day

01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,790
and I think it was I can't remember what

01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,890
the name was

01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:20,470
LCI like coffee who really wants to

01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,990
support more conferences so why not try

01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:25,750
running your own you should become a

01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:28,930
member it takes like 30 seconds you go

01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:31,270
to Linux to alter a you and click the

01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:34,960
sign-up link and then you'll get a like

01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:39,100
a thing and they'll say yes doesn't cost

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:41,140
anything is free so there's also other

01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,480
things that are Linux Australia like

01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:46,660
barcamps although we lights Australia

01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,920
has contributed to various spark camps

01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,809
there's also SD

01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,349
see which is apparently in New Zealand

01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:54,760
this year

01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:55,960
you should join a user group I thought

01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,900
there was going to be another talk on

01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,970
user groups but definitely joining user

01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:04,150
group Django user group Python user

01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:06,609
group Linux user group I'd also like to

01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:10,869
point out that there's pie video - org

01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:14,980
which has recordings from PyCon au 2012

01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:18,670
and a whole bunch of other pie cones so

01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:20,920
I think that's my last slide so I just

01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:26,069
like to repeat my con was awesome

01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,069
