By using a variety of techniques and technologies, you can tap into the expert knowledge of others more effectively. Revision control and code reviews are great for software quality, but not everyone is going to work that way. Tools such as ipython notebook, sharing gists, demonstration sessions and screencasts are a great way to get others involved in problem solving. Knowing how to use these tools quickly and effectively c

i mean good morning everyone

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,320
hello chris uh thanks very much to

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,880
everyone who spoke yesterday for what's

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
been

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,920
the most outstanding pike on a you ever

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,400
it's just been amazing so thanks for

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
giving all your time as well so my talk

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,400
is somewhat lazily named

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,640
sharing stuff with python so i'm not

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
going to dwell on the name

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
my name tennessee lewenberg i work for

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,199
the centre for australian weather and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
climate research

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,880
which is part of the australian bureau

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,640
of meteorology in partnership with csiro

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
i've been working in python for about 10

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
years before that i was working in java

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
and before that

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,280
i was just at uni and my work involves

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,440
mostly automatic text generation

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
artificial intelligence and weather

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,160
domain logic

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
so the system that i work on is

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
responsible for producing the first

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,079
draft

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
of all of the text weather forecasts

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
that you see

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
on the on the web page and over the tv

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,239
and so forth

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
along with obviously a team of many

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
i have a philosophy diploma i can't

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,600
really remember why i did that but i

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
enjoyed it a lot

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,280
and then i went and did a masters of

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
business administration i can remember

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
why i did that

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
and i didn't enjoy it as much

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
i completed a couple of uh udacity

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,360
online courses

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,000
the so-called moocs in artificial

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,159
intelligence and robotic vehicle control

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,360
and for the past four years i've been

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,000
relegated to the bench as a manager

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
so this talk super high level it's aimed

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
at developers

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,040
i think i got that right okay so people

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
without a tech background

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
are often not fully aware of what it

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,280
takes to get things done

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,200
and what the hidden costs are and also

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,600
are often too busy to really think about

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,680
it even if they do have some awareness

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,799
this lack of awareness can be a major

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
disconnect between

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
between people in general but

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
specifically to us

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
between developers and managers domain

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
experts and others involved in modern

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,000
cross-functional teams

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,240
also sharing is important

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,479
according to a recent cambridge study

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,319
says this press report

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,319
the global cost of debugging software is

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,440
written to three risen to 312 billion

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,280
dollars annually

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,720
so one i think that's probably about

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
right but two

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
i just have to share here some of the

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
details and why you need to spend some

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
time

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
understanding things that are being put

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,280
in front of you in general this goes for

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
us as developers

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
and managers as well one it's a big

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
number it's about five times the market

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,519
value of facebook

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,760
is just spent debugging software

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,800
another one the only real reference i

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
could find to this

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,519
is through something called prweb.com

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
now this is in fact a legitimate

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
study in a legitimate link but the

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
journalists involved didn't care to

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
source

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,519
the reference where they got the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
original study from

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,519
don't do this you need to be more

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
transparent with what it is that you're

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,160
putting in front of people

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
if you really want to gain their

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,800
credibility

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,480
so let's talk about credibility this is

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,040
a frequent problem

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
both of these things are peacocks so i'm

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
led to understand

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
the one on the left is the one that they

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,760
asked me to build

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
and the one on the right is the one

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,920
that's as simple as possible

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
this is the one that i will build 10

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
times out of 10

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,080
unless i understand that this is what is

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
required

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
so how do we get there

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
well we're going to take a little side

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
journey before i get to the point

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
we're going to talk about evolution

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,200
instead or everything

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,120
has a history and the fact that zebras

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,480
are not donkeys

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,000
zebras look a bit like donkeys they both

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,640
have long faces

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,599
this one has stripes but it's just the

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
chrome right

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,560
who really cares

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
but the the point is is that no matter

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
how similarly

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,360
similar these things are i can ride a

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
donkey that's probably the key feature

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,319
here you can actually ride a donkey but

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
there is really no practical way to get

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,720
from a zebra to a donkey

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
despite the obvious similarities i know

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
this

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
because well i actually haven't tried

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
but like i'm pretty sure okay i think

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
you can trust me

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
okay but and and that's that but when

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,759
i'm telling that to my manager

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,799
like no no you you just can't get there

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,239
from here

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,880
it's not always such an obvious

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,880
conversation

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,160
so let's talk about what's going on i

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,240
don't know anything about

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
biology and i'm a lazy researcher so

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
you're really gonna just have to like

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
just follow the hand waving on this one

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
the genotype refers to the things that

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
make up

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
the donkey on the inside it's history

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,560
it's ancestry it's genes the reasons why

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
it's a donkey

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
it's phenotype well as you saw it's

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,040
phenotype is kind of like you know brown

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,400
and it's like it's a pretty cute donkey

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
and it's got floppy ears and

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,280
and so forth so

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
when people see two things with a

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
similar phenotype

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,320
it's pretty logical to kind of support

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,400
your first guess is that

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,400
probably they have a similar genotype

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
turns out that's not true so this is my

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
back of uh

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,039
it's not quite a napkin this is my very

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,479
elegant sketch that i put together to

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
generally explain

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,840
my understanding of how evil evolution

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
works

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,560
is that this is a love story

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,280
between fido and lassie fido has brown

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,440
spots

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,720
he's very big and his key feature is

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
that he's a very warm

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,919
loving and happy individual that's his

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
phenotype

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,039
lassie up the top there she's you know

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
very impressive

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,680
she's intelligent uh by happenstance

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
medium size

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,400
and and golden golden fur at least

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,080
that's what i remember from watching

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
lassie but the key feature up there is

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
is that she's very

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,080
intelligent and these these phenotypes

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
phenotypic advantages in the real world

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,759
give have brought them together and so

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
like like any two people that are in

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
love

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,319
that they come together and they start a

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
family and what we can see here is that

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,319
as we follow it through the generations

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,000
these phenotypes persist

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
again perhaps i don't have to draw the

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
dots for you when building software

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
the major advantages in software persist

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
and what we end up after a number of

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
generations is something called a wild

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
type

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,280
there are many things that are fido like

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
in the world many

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
many offspring of fido in future

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,800
generations but they all carry this

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,919
phenotype through into their later

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
stages of evolution

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
so someone who actually knows what

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,199
they're doing drew this picture

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
and what i can see here is that quite a

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,199
lot of these things

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
these animals here on the phenotype side

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
some of them look pretty different

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
some of them look pretty similar and

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
some of the ones that look pretty

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
similar

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,639
are pretty far away on these lines here

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
and in a sense these lines

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
going through here represent work for in

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,800
some sense

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,919
undertaken by evolution of over the

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,840
number of years

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,400
to result in this diversity of different

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,560
species that we see here on the right

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,160
but getting back from one to the other

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
is not so easy

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,080
in a breeding program perhaps you could

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
get from the arctic fox to the kit fox

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
with relatively little work if the kit

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,280
fox had some advantage the arctic fox

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
had less

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,800
of you could probably you know

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
make your way from one to another but

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
there's probably really no way to make

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
your way

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,599
from the top to the bottom it may be

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
possible to tr to

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,319
move from a cgi bin application written

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
with a whole lot of scripts to a django

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
app

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
but it may not be as easy to translate

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,120
your core business logic from java to

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
python

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,960
so planning and decisions is where i

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,160
feel this comes in

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,240
there's this myth that if you

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
could just work out what you actually

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,039
wanted early enough

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
early you wouldn't have to get from the

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,000
top to the bottom

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
you just turn left and ted instead of

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
turning right it's free

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
if you can make the decision back there

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,000
but there's not really any

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
such thing as back there really we

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
basically

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,879
choose something everything has a

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
history there's nothing that doesn't

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
have a history

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
there's no clean starting point there is

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,919
no clean slate

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,479
there's just complexity that we bring in

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
so at the start when we appear to have a

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
clean slate

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
what we don't have is visibility we

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,240
don't have visibility of the complexity

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,840
we're bringing in

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
we don't have the visibility of the

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,719
complexity that's leading where we're

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
going

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
and the only person who's sitting there

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
making these decisions is you

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
as a developer and i don't know about

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
you but when it's me

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
that's a pretty dodgy heuristic for an

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,240
a-star search

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,680
so yet another complete change of

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,720
direction

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,839
people who rise to leadership roles have

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,880
been prepared to be different

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,760
don't believe everything you think okay

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,680
don't get stuck in a rut so here i'm

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,839
going to talk about

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
the personal side of being involved in

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,680
decisions and communication

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
and people's reactions now i'm not

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
trying to address here people who may be

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
facing situations of

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,600
gross poor behavior or or serious

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,320
dysfunction i'm just talking about

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,160
the the sufficiently complex ordinary

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
interactions that when we face when we

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
go to work

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,480
with four or five other people who are

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,160
all basically going to work to get on

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,040
with get on with their job

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
and the complexities that arise therein

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
so

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,320
this is me cooking some pancakes and

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,080
this this expresses to me one a number

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
of things is that i love how ambiguous

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
it is is that i'm basically a happy guy

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,320
i turn up to work and i try and get

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,240
things done now as a manager i'm pretty

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
aware of some things one is that com

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,760
software is more complex than a pancake

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
another one is that people aren't

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,120
spatulas

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
and another and another one is that is

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
that i'm not actually allowed to wear

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,560
silly hats in the workplace it somehow

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,200
doesn't seem to set the right tone

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,040
but that aside broadly people expect me

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
to bring the whole meal together

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,120
i turn up to work and my role as as a

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
manager is that people are looking me to

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,640
bring it together and that's pretty much

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,040
the same as a chef

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,079
but then i get this sneaking suspicion

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,279
that what i'm doing

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,279
isn't actually quite the right thing

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,200
and i've had this as a manager and i've

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,279
had this as a developer and i've seen it

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,519
in others

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,519
sometimes you really begin to question

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
whether you're supposed to be doing what

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,040
it is that you're actually doing

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
sometimes you'll walk into a room full

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,120
of managers as a developer

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
and they're not going to listen to you

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
they're going to say

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,600
what do you mean it's too difficult what

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
do you mean it's too hard

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
why can't it get done faster and you're

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,000
left going

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,440
but i've given you the reasons

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
sometimes you'll be in a group of people

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
and the person you're working with just

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
doesn't

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
seem to get it now this

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
usually isn't because there's anything

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,959
inherently wrong

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,880
wrong sorry wrong with the person

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,480
in this picture normally it's about

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
roles there's going to be a reason

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760
there's always

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
some reason and there's an immediate

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,079
frustration but if you think

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
hardened long enough and you can take a

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
deep breath and get there there's

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
normally some reason maybe they're in

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,160
maybe they're new to the role maybe

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
their experience is

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,040
in something very different and they're

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
coming together with it maybe they're

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
just

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,399
busy and then

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,959
sometimes this is just how you feel

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,600
about other people

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,360
you know the sad thing is that science

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
says it's true

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,680
i'm actually not very good at any of

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
these things this is the most amazing

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
study i've ever read

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
this is called the dunning-kruger effect

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
and for anyone who thinks they're any

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
good at anything

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
you should read this cover to cover four

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
times

00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,800
what this is saying is that people

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,399
who are terrible like abjectly horrible

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,600
at performing on some task think

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,480
that they're like pretty good pretty

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,160
good

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
so if you're cruising around and you've

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
just you know you've had a tough time of

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,920
whatever it is that's in front of you

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,639
and you think you know what i've got it

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
i feel like

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,079
60 70 confident i'm just getting started

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,760
well i'm sorry we haven't

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
okay so people who are doing a little

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,079
bit worse

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,279
still 60 70 percent they're feeling

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
pretty good

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,600
pretty good so the top two lines up

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,600
there represent

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,839
for someone who's really terrible they

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,000
feel pretty good before they do the test

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
they also feel pretty good after they do

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
the test and then their marks don't pan

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,639
out

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,639
okay third quartile people with actual

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,519
competence

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,680
there's this odd dip that's pretty weird

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
to me so what's happening here

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
is that the people who actually have

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
some degree of confidence competence in

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
what they're talking about

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,200
generally mark themselves about as well

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,639
as the people who are as bad as they can

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
possibly be

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
and slightly worse than the people who

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,000
are only quite bad at it

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,800
and only the very very best people at

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,360
performing a particular task

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,440
actually see a lift in their actual

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,519
performance

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
so there's a there's a number of reasons

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
of things going here

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
going on here but the one that that

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
having read the paper i believe is the

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,720
most particularly relevant

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,399
is that in order to assess competence

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
you have to have competence

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
now i don't mean like have the right

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
stuff

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
in the sense of like intelligence or

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
just being a good human i mean for the

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,320
particular problem at hand

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,760
you know i'm i'm a very very bad soccer

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
player

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,440
after many years i've finally accepted

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
i'm a very very bad soccer player it

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,600
took a little time

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,120
okay but i didn't know it for years

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
because i couldn't tell i could watch a

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,399
game of soccer with the people who are

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
bad and people who are good and i go

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,519
they're playing soccer so in order to

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
develop

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
a real understanding of whether you've

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
whether you

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,800
have a good plan whether you're going in

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,040
the right direction

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
why something is the way it is you need

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,199
to look at developing your own

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
competence

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
before you can really make that

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,959
assessment

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,440
i'm now going to take five minutes out

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
to watch a movie this is also

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,959
this is what i call the antidote the

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,120
antidote to the frustration the antidote

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
to our own frustrated sense of

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
incompetence or our own

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,240
actual and justified sense of

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
incompetence at some place

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
because when you're when you turn up to

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
work it doesn't matter if you're not

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
good at the thing yet

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,000
that's okay you're allowed to not be

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
good at everything

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
it's pretty expected but this is the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,800
antidote this is how we can get

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,079
get get get in the direction of progress

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
so it's five minutes

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,199
it's a bit long for it take time out of

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,800
a keynote but it's one of the most

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,800
interesting things that i've ever seen

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,160
and thanks to this group rsa animate for

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:13,839
the animation

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,839
i didn't prepare this content obviously

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
our motivations are unbelievably

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,880
interesting i mean

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,399
i i find i've been working on this for a

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,639
few years and i just find the topic

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,399
still so amazingly engaging

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
and interesting so i want to tell you

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
about that the science is really

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
surprising

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,600
the science is a little bit freaky okay

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,519
it we are not as endlessly manipulable

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,959
and as predictable as you would think

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
there's a whole set of

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
unbelievably interesting studies i want

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
to give you two that call

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
into question this idea that if you

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
reward something you get more of the

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,920
behavior you want

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,800
if you punish something you get less of

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,560
it so let's talk let's go from

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,639
london to the mean streets of cambridge

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,920
massachusetts in the northeastern part

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,920
of the united states and let's talk

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
about a study done at mit massachusetts

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,639
institute of technology

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
here's what they did they took a whole

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
group of students and they gave them a

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,360
set of challenges

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,440
things like memorizing strings of digits

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
solving word puzzles other kinds of

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
spatial puzzles even physical tasks like

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,240
throwing a ball through a hoop

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,680
okay they gave them these challenges and

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,880
they said to incentivize their

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,880
performance

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,000
they gave them three levels of rewards

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,839
okay so

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
if you did pretty well you got a small

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,120
monetary reward

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,480
if you did medium well you got a medium

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,079
monetary reward

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
and if you did really well if you were

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,480
one of the top performers you got a

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,680
large cash

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,680
prize okay we've seen this movie before

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,519
this is essentially a typical motivation

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,160
scheme within organizations right

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,160
we reward the very top performers we

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
ignore the low performers and

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,839
the other folks kind of in the middle

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,720
okay you get a little bit

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,920
so what happens they do the test they

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
have these incentives here's what they

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,839
found out

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,320
one as long as the task involved only

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,920
mechanical skill

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
bonuses worked as they would be expected

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
the higher the pay the better their

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,079
performance

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
okay that makes sense but here's what

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,799
happens but

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,400
once the task called for even

00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,720
rudimentary cognitive skill

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,880
a larger reward led to poorer

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
performance

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,400
now this is strange right a larger

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,600
reward led to poor performance how can

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
that possibly be

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,799
now what's interesting about this is

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,360
that these folks here who

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,439
who did this are all economists two at

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
mit one at the university of chicago

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,720
one at carnegie mellon okay the top tier

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,079
of the economics profession

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,400
and they're reaching this conclusion

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,679
that seems contrary to what a lot of us

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
learned in economics

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,280
which is which is that the higher the

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
reward the better their performance and

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
they're saying

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,840
that once you get above rudimentary

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,400
cognitive skill

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,919
it's the other way around which seems

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,960
like this kind of the idea that these

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
rewards don't work

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,559
that way seems vaguely left-wing and

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
socialist doesn't it

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,320
it's kind of this kind of weird

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
socialist conspiracy

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
for those of you who have those

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,080
conspiracy theories i want to point out

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,919
the

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,679
notoriously left-wing socialist group

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,559
that finance the research

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,400
the federal reserve bank so this is the

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,280
mainstream of the mainstream coming to a

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
conclusion that's

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
quite surprising seems to defy the laws

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,640
of behavioral physics

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,080
so this is strange a strange funny so

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
what do they do they say let's this is

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,200
this is freaky let's go test it

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
somewhere else maybe that

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
fifty dollars or sixty dollar prize

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,480
isn't sufficiently motivating

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
for an mit student right so let's go to

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,480
a place where fifty dollars is actually

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,840
more significant relatively right so

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
let's take the experiment we're gonna go

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,400
to matara india

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,080
rural india where 50 60 whatever the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,280
number was is actually a significant sum

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
of money so they replicated the

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
experiment in india

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,880
roughly as follows small rewards the

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,080
equivalent of two weeks salary

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,760
um i mean sorry small performance low

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,440
performance two week salary

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
medium performance about a month's

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,160
salary um

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
high performance about two month salary

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,720
okay so those are real

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,799
good incentives okay so you're going to

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,880
get a different result here

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,640
well what happened though was that the

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,840
people offered the medium reward

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,160
didn't know better than the people

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,400
offered the small reward but this time

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
around the people offered the top reward

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,520
they did worst of all higher incentives

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,120
led to worse performance

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
what's interesting about this is that it

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,640
actually isn't all that anomalous this

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,320
has been replicated over and over and

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,440
over again by psychologists

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,280
by some extent by sociologists

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
and by economist over and over and over

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,840
again for simple straightforward tasks

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,280
those kinds of incentives if you do this

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,360
then you get that

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,640
they're great for tasks that are

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
algorithmic

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
set of rules where you have to just

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,360
follow along and get a right answer

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,720
if then it rewards carrots and sticks

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,120
outstanding

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,720
but when the task gets more complicated

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,840
when it requires some conceptual

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,320
creative thinking

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,200
those kinds of motivators demonstrably

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,400
don't

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,559
work fact money is a motivator

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
at work but in a slightly strange way if

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,000
you don't pay people enough

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
they won't be motivated what's curious

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
about there's another paradox here which

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
is that the best use of money as a

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
motivator

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
is to pay people enough to take the

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,039
issue of money off the table

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
pay people enough so that they're not

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
thinking about money and they're

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
thinking about the work

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,120
now once you do that it turns out there

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,000
are three factors that the science shows

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
lead to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
better performance um not to mention

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,880
personal satisfaction

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,880
autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:26,080
so autonomy mastery and purpose

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,440
so when we turn up at work going back to

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,280
that previous slide

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,559
we need to get to that level of

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
competence that's what we need for

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,039
ourselves that's what we need for the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,120
people around us

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,159
all of us are going to be involved in

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
work we're thinking

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,760
and problem solving is is the major part

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
of our day

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,799
our bosses our managers the people we

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
work with

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,520
no matter how frustrating or dense they

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,679
appear to be at any moment in time

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,559
are also turning up to work in an

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
environment

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
where autonomy autonomy mastery and

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
purpose

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,080
is what's driving them at work it's not

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,400
money money can represent status

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,720
status can be a source of conflict

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
supervision supervisory control those

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,799
issues can be a source of

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,440
conflict but simply money isn't a big

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,520
issue

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
so how how do we design teams how do we

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
take this back to the world of open

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
source how do we take this back

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,919
to work how do we take it back to

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
ourselves how do we take it back to the

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,600
way we share

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
with others how do we give other people

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,039
who are working with us

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,240
the control that they need to do their

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,400
job when their job is managing us

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,600
how do they give us the control we need

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,720
to do our job

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,080
when we are working for them how do we

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
work with our customers

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,840
to give them the control that they need

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,799
when we are working to supply their

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
needs

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,240
now steve no henry ford once said

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
if i'd listened to my customers i would

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
have well built the world's best

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,440
horse-drawn carriage

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
okay so we need to do more we need to

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
say no

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,799
we need to be able to have our own

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,280
control and we need to give them

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,520
some control so how do we how do we get

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,880
towards that direction

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
now i want to talk about this in the

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
context of a real situation something

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,080
much more concrete something much more

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,320
relevant say you've got

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,840
four people and we have a problem to

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,640
solve we have to build something we need

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,320
to build

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,919
a django app it needs to um

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,360
you know obviously well we don't need to

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,960
build a django app there's no such thing

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,960
we need to build a web app

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
someone who knows about web apps and

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,720
uses python

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,400
it has a preference for a django app and

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
we have someone from the customer side

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,720
and we have a meeting once a fortnight

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
with them

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,240
because we're all agile which is

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
fantastic by the way

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,360
so i want to talk about here about how

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,520
my thinking works as a developer how i

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,640
think generally thinking works when

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
addressing problems

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
which is this cycle here which is that

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,880
we start we're confronted with a problem

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,559
all of you to some degree depending on

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,559
exactly how good a night you had last

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,559
night are thinking about this situation

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,640
information is interesting who are these

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,240
four people i want to know more

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
what's their problem a web app that's

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
not a good description of a problem

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,360
are they selling shoes or are they

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,559
selling software they're different you

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,520
want to know more

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
you care about where the story is going

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
but then

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,280
after a while it's just somebody talking

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,559
at you

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,799
you've learned it you've got you're like

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,400
yeah right look i get it i just want to

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
do something now i want to i want to

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
build my concrete system here i've i've

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,559
learned a lot of information

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
i've done a lot of reading i've

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,520
consulted with people i've understood

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
what i'm pretty sure i've got to build

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,880
so now okay i've got this picture in my

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
head

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
i'm going to go away it's going to take

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,919
me i've got to provision some machines

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,360
i'm going to use a vagrant and salt to

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,559
provision them all because that seems

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
really good because i learned that

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
recently

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,600
and i'm going to sit there and and give

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,880
give demos once a fortnight because i've

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
heard demos are good and we'll have a

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
scrum board okay we're doing it and we

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
know what we're going to build

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,279
so we get on with it now if you're at

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,640
this stage and somebody comes in with

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,039
some new information

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
oh hey by the way i've learned something

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,760
new that's

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
that's really annoying back here back

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,520
here that information was cool here this

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,000
information is not cool

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,880
because we're building it and then then

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,720
it's there

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919
and then we we kind of take a brief

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,400
breath we

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,840
move on there's a process in place so

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
now what we're doing is we can see that

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
change is needed like we've built it we

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,159
got it done

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
but we can see that point something

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,080
something's not right there

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,840
but if somebody's still back here okay

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,279
if someone still feels like this isn't

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
done like it hasn't made it to

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
operations it's not

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
not finished it's not reliable enough

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,320
then this is death march territory you

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
know you've just got to keep grinding

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
away

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
on something where you're still you want

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,640
to move on

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,320
okay so here we're accepting you know

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
we're like okay i built that thing it

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
was good there are new needs i'm happy

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
about that

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,120
adapt inspect have a look come back

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,159
towards the information

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,200
information is interesting again

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
so over time groups of people who are

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
working together

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,640
will go through these stages in a

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,559
similar and coordinated fashion

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,880
if you don't engage with the people

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,440
around you your manager

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,159
your colleagues your supervisor the

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,520
juniors

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,760
uh customers clients the full

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,440
spectrum of stakeholders you're not

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,559
going to have synchronization around

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
here

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,640
now that might be okay at stage one

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
where you can cover off the ground

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
everything can be explained relatively

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
easily but what when you're what if

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,279
you're going up

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
on version two of this iteration

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,279
suddenly things become more complex

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,480
if someone try if even if you're in the

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,720
same stage

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
information is interesting you might be

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
up at stage four if you're a

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,760
django core developer and you're

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,279
confronted with a problem

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,279
you're thinking at a different level to

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,760
someone who's coming in at the bot you

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,440
know

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,120
at the bottom there's nothing wrong with

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,720
the fact that you're at different levels

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,720
but there's another source of

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,919
uncoordination a disconnect there

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,279
between the people that you're trying to

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,679
work with

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,000
and and where you're trying to get to

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,000
and so what we want to not talk about

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,840
is what are the disconnects which lead

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
to this kind of situation

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,279
we talked about the motivation to

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
disconnect looking at autonomy

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,559
mastery and purpose you want to know

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,799
where you're going you want someone

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,919
who's representing a goal state to you

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,840
telling you that yes

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,679
this is valuable you do this with your

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
time and we are going to get there

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,279
you also want to be able to work on your

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,559
own as a developer and you also want to

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,919
have the control that you need to get

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
your job done

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
we've talked about the delusion of

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,080
competence any time that you think that

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
you know

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
you're in the right and everyone else is

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,880
in the wrong actually yes that is

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
sometimes true

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,559
but it's a dangerous path to go down and

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,960
get too anchored in

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,760
we've talked about management disconnect

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
to a degree

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
i wanted to just drill into that a

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,559
little more and talk about two kinds of

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,000
managers that tend to come around

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,320
there's technical managers

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,279
in the world people like me i used to be

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,279
a developer

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,640
i still write the odd line of code and

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,919
and now i'm kind of

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,240
to a degree moving on slightly into

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240
product owner roles or pure management

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,919
and i fill out a lot of forms and i

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
justify things and

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,360
and i try to keep that sort of

00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
helicopter perspective the frustrations

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,120
there

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,880
are that sometimes you it's not clear

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,400
when you're a technical manager it's

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
less obvious where it is that you're

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,880
supposed to go you have to do a bit more

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
work

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
to figure out what the right direction

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,039
is and that can frustrate other people

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
because

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,240
it's not as obvious that you're leading

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,919
them in a good direction it's not as

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
obvious that things are kind of

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,320
all right on the other hand when they

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
say they need to spend a week doing the

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,440
unit testing and refactoring something

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
because of some reason

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
you get it and it's fine so that can be

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,799
very positive

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,240
another kind of manager is the domain

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,720
expert manager

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,159
and i'd like to think that most managers

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
have some kind of background in

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,120
something i'm not really going to try

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
and dwell on people who just don't have

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,960
a background

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
but domain experts they probably just

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,600
think that

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,039
you know if they say they'd like

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
something that you'll just kind of

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,200
fairly happily go off and build it

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,399
that there won't really be be much more

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
to it than that

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,600
yeah can i please have a shopping cart

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,919
application you do

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,120
you do web development you just you know

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,799
all about them right

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,240
you know what i want already because

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,720
you're a web developer that's just what

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,760
you're for

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,360
yeah but you know that's pretty much

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
what i expect when i take my car to the

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,320
mechanic

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,360
i drive it in and i say it is broken

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,240
fix it and then they come back to me and

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,559
they say

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
i have fixed it there was something

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,039
wrong with something near the sump

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,840
and the the brake pads needed to be

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
realigned

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,600
because they had somehow gotten out of

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
balance

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,760
okay i don't i don't get it but i do in

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,480
fact expect him to get it i expect him

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,360
to know

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,279
what i need so why is it really so

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,240
terribly unreasonable that the people

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,120
around us

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
expect us to know what they need now the

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
answer is

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,320
that we actually both need to get up

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,039
that ladder get up that knowledge ladder

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,279
get up that's

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,640
that information letter reduce the

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,320
disconnect because we're going to be

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,000
building something as a team

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,279
it's okay when you're not on the same

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,600
team but we're going to do this as a

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,320
team open sources everything's a team

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,880
really but

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,960
even in a workplace your organizers

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
organizational structure may put you all

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
in the same room

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,480
you might have to do some of this work

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,679
for yourself you might have to go well

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,039
i'm on team e a they're on team b but

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,240
i can see we're going to need to

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:21,200
actually get to know each other here

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,919
so the productivity of teams is to a

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,320
degree where i see the way out of this

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,559
diversity is a solution to local minima

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
is where i see the way out of this

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,399
working with someone else they're not

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
going to do your work for you they're

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,559
not going to come in and say oh

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,600
no look i've read all about django and

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,240
i've read all about

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,240
ruby on rails and i've actually

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,760
understood your technical domain

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,760
and you need to make this technical

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
decision that that's not going to happen

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
right because even if they had three

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,799
weeks to go and learn one learn the

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,360
other and come to that decision

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,000
it's not what their best place to do

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,080
it's not a proper use of their expertise

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,279
the proper use of their expertise is to

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360
come to the margins

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,399
to come to the interface with you also

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,480
at the interface

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,720
so that they can teach you what you need

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,039
to know and you can teach them what they

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
need to know it's about a development of

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,600
trust

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
between the people on your team and

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,440
learning how to act in a way

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,919
where you perform effectively as a group

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,840
where you all get on the idea elevator

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
together so that you're at the same

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
level and at the same

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,120
point in the cycle to the extent

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,520
possible together

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,600
that means a quality of information that

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,679
means not hiding your test coverage

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,360
or the fact that you just you know you

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,480
had a lazy week at work and you built a

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,640
game on a wiki

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,880
it means actually it means

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,159
but it also means not yelling at people

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,240
when they do that

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,159
it means that we're all people and we

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,600
act professionally but give or take a

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,320
brick there's going to be a bit of play

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,919
in the system

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,520
it also doesn't mean giving up

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,000
individual productivity

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,360
it doesn't mean that dividing up

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,480
thinking is you do that you do that you

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
do that you do that

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
and in a year's time will be done no it

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,120
doesn't mean that you've got to share

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,279
but it doesn't mean that it's not okay

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
to just work by yourself for three days

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,799
to work through a problem

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,640
or a week and it doesn't mean that it's

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,480
not okay for someone to be a lead

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
architect who sees the whole system

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
in fact that's a very useful thing it

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,279
doesn't mean that you can interrupt

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,039
someone every 10 minutes

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,360
that's not very useful either you have

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,399
to respect individual productivity

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,720
because just as

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,000
everything that i've said about group

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,640
dynamics is true

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
it is also absolutely true that people

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,000
can be

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,919
highly productive and usually are in it

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,120
when they're uninterrupted

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,240
for a reasonable bite of time

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,880
so section three python is doing it

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
right

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,480
in many examples so this is the bit

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,880
where we just chill out

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,600
i'll show you some tools it's all pretty

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,399
cruisy from here folks

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,519
so transparency of information at all

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,120
costs

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,279
in order to get yourself your autonomy

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,320
and your control you need to gain

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,720
credibility

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,840
you need to show people that what you're

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,120
doing is

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,440
sensible reliable it's not going to be

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,120
predictable but people will accept that

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,399
if you show them what you are doing with

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,240
your time and what your actual

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,480
productivity is

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
just because you're not achieving what

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,880
they want at their expected pace

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,480
doesn't mean that they won't accept what

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,640
you give them in terms of information

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,399
about your actual productivity

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,559
so let's talk about a couple of systems

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,360
here that demonstrate some of what i'm

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,039
talking about

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,200
this one's not a python example this is

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,440
a website called forecast io

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,039
which is really cool for all the weather

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,080
nodes in the audience

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,360
maybe it's just me so here we have a

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,360
basic system

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
it's very accessible the information's

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,399
all at the front

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
but i can go back to this thing here

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,600
called the time machine

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,600
i can go back in time and i can see what

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,320
the forecast was in the past

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,039
so i can check whether what they said in

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,080
the past

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,360
matched up with what actually happened i

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,960
can go

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,200
these people here who are running this

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,799
system i don't know who there are

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,640
they are i don't know what their data is

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,640
from i don't necessarily trust them yet

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,559
and i care you know you know obviously

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
look forecaster forecast is fine this

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,000
will be right data

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,080
but if i actually you know maybe it's a

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,440
critical use case for me i can go back

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
to december 26 2010 and see what their

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,080
forecast said

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,279
they are being open they are being

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,080
transparent and therefore i trust them

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,880
pie pie is also doing it right this is

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,559
python

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,720
pie pie is the python interpreter

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,559
written in python so what these people

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
have is something called a system called

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,760
code speed

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,440
and what we see here on the yellow line

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,320
there that we just scrolled past that's

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
normalized to see

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
python performance all of these graphs

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,360
here are

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,760
individual pi pi relative performances

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,679
we can see here check-in by check-in

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,799
what the impact of the modification that

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,039
occurred was

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,960
we can go back to the timeline we can

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,120
see for a specific set of benchmarks

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,960
what the performance has been over time

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,200
even if someone even if the pipe

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,000
developers wander off into the forest

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
and don't do

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,760
anything very visible for three months

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,079
that i care about

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,280
i can see that they're busy i can see

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,639
that they're doing things

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,079
i can see that they're taking

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,079
responsibility when an issue occurs

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
i can see that these people you know

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,119
they've got it together right

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
and that's what we need to build we need

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,679
to build this image in our supervisors

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,520
in our customers and our clients that we

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,079
as a group we have got it together we

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,599
are doing the things

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,800
so i'm going to go through here some of

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,679
the tools we can use as ourselves to do

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,359
this i mean

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,280
actually this code speed tool that's a

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,040
download loadable thing you can pull it

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,919
off github you can build one

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,599
i highly recommend it i'm going to go

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,119
through here one specific example of

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,280
where i used a piece of technology

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,359
called the ipython notebook which we saw

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
talked about yesterday and i think that

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,640
these things are going to be with us

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,880
for a very very long time and

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,920
this is also where i'm going to dive

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
into

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,480
live demo territory but it's not that

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,599
live so i wouldn't worry about it

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,160
so what i've done here is i've pulled

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,680
out

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,359
some things off some notebooks from the

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,640
internet and one of my own making into

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,160
into this directory

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,880
and i'm going to just spool up a

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
notebook here

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
okay here we go so i've got a couple of

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,119
notebooks

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,119
this one here a notebook is basically

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,400
like a cross between like an interpreter

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,920
and a wiki

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,680
so back in back in some time in the past

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
oh look we can see my

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,119
stand-up time fellas you got to make the

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,839
daily stand up

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,480
okay so here we go this is a notebook

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,119
that's

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,560
helping us understand bayesian logic now

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,720
i'm not here to advocate that everyone

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,320
needs to go and learn bayesian logic

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,240
what i'm saying is that this is a really

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,680
good way to do so should that be of

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,760
interest to you at this particular point

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,920
in time so i can go through here

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,599
looks like a book it's telling me stuff

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,040
it's telling me stop more stuff it's

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,720
telling me about the state of mind i'm

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,760
supposed to have

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,680
yeah yeah go on go on go on i just want

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,359
to write the call there's some maths oh

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,720
wait i don't understand maths

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,400
oh code okay so

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,320
the advantage of something of a system

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,839
like this now i've extracted this code

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,520
out into another notebook

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,240
is that you can copy and paste the code

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,720
out

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,400
into another notebook for your own

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,200
purposes on your own system

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,920
you can execute it live i don't have to

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,079
trust

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,760
that this thing when this got published

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,560
happened to work at the time

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,040
i can go up here and push go and it sits

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,119
there

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,160
and it grinds away and it gives me error

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,000
messages so i know it's real

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,280
and here we go here's the output so i'm

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,040
like oh okay

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,720
now i'll just spend a brief time so this

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,320
is this is just going through tossing

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,440
some coins

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,839
tossed a coin oh it didn't cost no

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,560
didn't

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,400
toss any coins flat distribution oh wait

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,200
it tossed one and the only one it got

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,440
was a head so it's it's biased

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,160
and then we toss a few more coins and

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,680
okay that's still a bit out of whack oh

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,359
here we go it's a bit of a lump but it's

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,280
kind of biased we've got

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,040
you know not enough heads you know for

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,880
what for what's reasonable

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,200
maybe the number generators on the fritz

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
i don't know oh wait hang on so if we

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,160
toss enough coins

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
where i'm headed okay bang okay now we

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,640
can see that this distribution is

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
centered on

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,359
on point five so i can go in here and

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,320
validate for myself

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,160
that what's happening is real now not

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,760
terribly many managers are always going

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,520
to want to go into every

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,440
dimension of what it is that we want to

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,599
do but if we need to spin up a tool to

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,079
explain somewhat something to someone

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,200
we can use a tool like this now i'm not

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,680
trying to say that

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,760
the manager in this example is going to

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,079
spend some time commenting on our code

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
they may but basically that's our job

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,800
it's our job as a team of developers

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,320
and it's architecture leads and it's

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,720
technology people's job

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,320
but this is a way where we can literally

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,119
change the code on the fly for an

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
example

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,920
and have the person in the room

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,040
commenting on what these things are

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
supposed to look like

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,400
it's a way of bridging that disconnect

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,680
of reducing the distance

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,920
but not but not crossing over so

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,520
without a system like this the distance

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,480
between what we've been asked to build

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,640
by our manager

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,160
our boss the person who doesn't get it

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
doesn't put the time into thinking why

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,160
our problems are hard

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,599
and us who have spending a lot of time

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,320
you know struggling to build this thing

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,240
as fast as their appetite goes for

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,640
gets narrower we can come together at

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,440
least on this particular point

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,040
and so i did this i did this at work and

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,119
i gave it a go

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,200
and some people at work were telling me

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,440
a lot of things about sea breezes

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,320
our code spurs out a lot of a lot of

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,119
guff

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
this is an upside down tasmania by

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,040
chance

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,480
and it didn't really it wasn't terribly

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,079
relevant to turn it the right way around

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,119
for my example i figured they could cope

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,680
with it

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,280
some more more downloading more more

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,320
more code okay so now this is

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,720
this is an action so this is a graph of

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
the

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
height of the ocean with respect to the

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,640
distance

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,240
from the coastline and this is so that i

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,720
can say things like

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,920
c's one to two meters increasing to four

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,920
meters offshore

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,599
pretty straightforward and people were

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,200
telling me that this were giving me all

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,480
these examples where this was going to

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,079
really really easily be the case now

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,480
let's see if i can just shrink this down

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,079
a bit yeah here we go

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,800
okay okay so that looks alright on the

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,000
projector

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,720
so whoops there we go maybe even

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,079
one more shrink so people were telling

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,680
me that this particular day

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,119
this represents three hour blocks of the

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,480
day with the morning in the top lift and

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,640
the evening in the top right

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,320
was a really good candidate for sea

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,760
breezes one to two meters increasing to

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,760
three metres offshore and i think

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,800
maybe it was lower offshore it was there

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
was supposed to be a differentiation

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,800
but what we can see is that the

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,920
evening's actually pretty flat

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,839
this line here represents like what

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,960
would be explained by the language

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,800
this is like the claim is that blue line

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
and all of these points are the actual

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,359
data points that are supposed to relate

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,880
to that claim

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,560
if the claim was true you would see the

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,800
blue line exactly

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,079
kind of matching all of these points but

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,680
what we see here

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,680
is that particularly in the middle of

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
the day but kind of all over the shop

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,680
there is in fact not really very much

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,880
relationship between those blue dots and

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,800
that blue line

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,319
now if i didn't have this piece of

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
evidence available

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,400
to have that conversation with these

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,119
people there is no way that they would

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,160
accept my word as a technology developer

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,480
over their word as a scientist because

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,400
it's because it becomes competitive you

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,040
don't want it to become competitive

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,560
but they love looking at pictures

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,760
because this is their bread and butter

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,800
these pictures are their bread and

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,319
butter they're like

00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,319
oh right now i care now i'm interested

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,160
now i see that actually what's going on

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,319
in this particular data set isn't what i

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,240
thought was going on in this data set

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,359
okay try a different data set or try a

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,040
different algorithm

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
or try a different way of processing

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,640
something and all of a sudden

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,480
they're in their technical element

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
they're in what they do for a day job

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,079
they're

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,640
they're in their domain of competence

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,240
they're somewhere that i can't go but

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,240
we've managed to bridge the disconnect

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,800
now how do i restart presentation in two

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,359
seconds flat

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
oh from the beginning of course that's

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,599
because that's really where i wanted to

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,680
be

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,599
okay all right so

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,280
five second overview okay so here's

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,880
here's some more example

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,200
examples this is something called a sea

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,040
breeze the sea breeze here has been to a

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
degree manually inserted and repres and

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,000
that you can see an increase very close

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,319
to the coastline

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,240
in this particular example the broad

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,040
scale wind field is just doing

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,760
you know whatever it does but in this in

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,359
this fine scale here

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,599
the the land and the ocean are

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,400
interacting the heat the heat

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,680
transfer at the land in the ocean is

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,200
interacting

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,160
and so they gave me some some

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,160
description of how to compare

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,400
how to produce numbers to compare what

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,280
was going on on the land in the ocean

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,560
so i did that and this is the graph i

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,400
produced

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
and you can see very very little

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,000
difference between what's going on in

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,000
the land in the ocean

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,520
now i don't know how to refine this

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,680
algorithm particularly

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,359
it's not really my area of expertise if

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,640
somebody really sat me down and

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,440
explained it like i'm pretty sure i

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,960
could follow it

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
i'm pretty sure all of you could follow

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,960
it none of this stuff is like

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,640
actually you know impossible to

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,560
understand piece by piece

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,599
but knowing the whole space of the

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,119
domain is really going to be beyond me

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,520
but again this is somewhere where i can

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,040
produce an image i can make it tangible

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
i can make it concrete

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,119
in order to have these conversations

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,560
with people so python's doing it right

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,240
python has these tools

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,160
scipy matplotlib uh you know i'm not so

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,480
strong on the on the website of things

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,480
because i just don't like browser

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,319
incompatibility and i don't go there

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,079
but i'm sure that i'm sure it exists

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,000
there too so

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,200
what is going on what is going on in

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,079
this example

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,839
how can we engage people in diving in

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,839
this is something i know about this is a

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,680
tree i know all about trees

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,440
republicans and democrats are not quite

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,000
the same thing as sea breezes

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,960
but the same principle applies i can use

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,160
my knowledge

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,920
as a technologist in order to apply

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,000
probably apply techniques that i know

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,280
how to solve to problems that people

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,040
present to me

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,480
each of these things here represents a

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,119
kind of a decision point

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,960
insure offshore above the ground below

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,960
the you know at the ground level

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,880
wind direction and wind speed every one

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,400
of these can be used as an indicator i

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,960
need to be knowledgeable

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,720
about my fit my domain my field so that

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
i can apply the what the solutions that

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,200
i know

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,040
to somebody else where the hell's my

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
slides going meaning of mind so that we

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,720
can have a meeting of minds

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,319
that's the goal so that we can meet so

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
that we can bring those disconnects down

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,560
to us

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,920
as narrow as possible so so pretty much

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,920
i'm done

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,920
i'll say a few things to wrap up and i

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,319
thank you very much for your time

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,480
we've taken a look at evolution how it

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,319
applies to software how decisions

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
increment in software over time and how

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,800
complexity builds challenges in

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,400
collaborating and tools and techniques

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,800
and converting this to outcomes so

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:37,839
in conclusion i just say as well as all

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,839
of that keep your sense of humor

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,760
