Description: 
	Creating a good search experience for your website is perceived as hard when it doesn't have to be so.

Starting with what is a search engine and how it works we will introduce the tools and techniques to help you design a search functionality that will make your users happy.

From tips on how to structure your data and tune your settings and queries to improve relevancy to features like faceted navigation and search-as-you-type autocomplete.

All examples will be shown using Elasticsearch and Django, though it should be applicable to other technologies as well.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
