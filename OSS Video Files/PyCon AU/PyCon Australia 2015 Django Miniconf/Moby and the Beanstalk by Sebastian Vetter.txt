Description: 
	The popularity of Docker these days is incredible and a lot of people are already using it for their production systems. Although it makes a lot of things much simpler, it's not a silver bullet and comes with some caveats of it's own. This talk will describe the journey of my team at Mobify from a self-hosted VM to a AWS-backed web app deployed using Docker.


PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.
