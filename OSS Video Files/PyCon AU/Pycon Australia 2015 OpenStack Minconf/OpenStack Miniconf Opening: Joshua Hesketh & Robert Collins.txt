00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,720
it's important that we help our

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,420
community grow and the codes of conduct

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,830
have been sort of granting quite a bit

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,080
attraction over the last number of years

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:44,330
as a good solid and straightforward way

00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:47,179
to do that morning tea that in the comet

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,640
and King George rooms if there are

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,440
sessions running we don't other rooms

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,149
are running late you don't want to

00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,640
overlap them you can go down to the void

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,000
for you go to the other lifts and then

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,770
back up again and you can get to them if

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,330
the other sessions have finished you can

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,330
cut through the Kennedy and Roosevelt

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,979
rooms to get to the morning tea area i'd

00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,539
give you a map but i have no idea which

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,009
way around the building is live alone

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,709
anything else so it wouldn't be very

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,190
helpful but there are maps in the foyer

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:17,360
and in the program apparently Oh someone

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,470
who's had time to look at the program

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
yay

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,190
lightning talks we have lightning talks

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,450
at the end of the day and to have a

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,920
whole bunch of good lightning talks

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,830
depends on you guys to put them together

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
like 3-4 minutes long tops like we

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,430
haven't set an exact length which will

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,830
be dependent on the number of talks we

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,650
get tweet Tony breeds and say that you

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,480
want to do a lightning talk and by the

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,850
end of the day give them the PDF or a

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,820
URL or river your slides are and will

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,980
plug his laptop in and do it Tony can

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,020
you stand out of anything turn around

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,890
that's Tony it will do our lightning

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:57,300
talks things together we will get you a

00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,390
sharp stick for extra credit if a talk

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,870
is boring you the LCAC FP has not yet

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:09,690
closed you can put your presentations

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:13,500
into the Sunday night black box on do

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,920
people know what lightning talks are no

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,070
one knows what lightning talks are Wow

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,390
yeah I think we should explain it so now

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,670
that thunder talk is a very different

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,680
sort of thing so a lightning talk is a

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,900
very short talk about the topic it's

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,140
just enough content to say what's going

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,040
on without diving super deep or some

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,890
people speak very very very fast they

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,450
are fun and they're a great way to get

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,860
into talking if you if you're not

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,540
comfortable standing up and give you

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,660
half hour talk but you know something

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,519
cool about I don't know your project

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,739
you're working on something you've seen

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,150
a bug you fix a bug that you want

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,640
someone else to fix and why it's

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,959
important the latest cool projects

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,610
someone else released and you want to

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,650
share knowledge about it kind of thing

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,530
just three three to five minutes up on

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,090
stage and you get kicked off yep you

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,450
don't even have to do slides we often

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,380
see people just stand up and say XYZ a b

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:21,740
c d e f and hop off again so very low

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:25,200
key tweet tony breeds and you'll be fine

00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:28,460

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,460
