Description: 
	Zaqar is probably one of the projects that had been debated the most in OpenStack. Nonetheless, this service capable of providing multi-tenant messaging is now becoming a more relevant part of the OpenStack infrastructure. 

One feature at a time, it's achieving its goals and improving itself. From multi-tenantcy, to subscriptions and persistent transports. In this talk, I'll present the project and its goals, the current state of art, its capabilities and architecture, the tools available and the related maintenance cost.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
