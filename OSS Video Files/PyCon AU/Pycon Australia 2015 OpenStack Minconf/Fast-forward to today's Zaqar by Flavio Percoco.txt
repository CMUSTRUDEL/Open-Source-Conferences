Title: Fast-forward to today's Zaqar by Flavio Percoco
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: Pycon Australia 2015 OpenStack Minconf
Description: 
	Zaqar is probably one of the projects that had been debated the most in OpenStack. Nonetheless, this service capable of providing multi-tenant messaging is now becoming a more relevant part of the OpenStack infrastructure. 

One feature at a time, it's achieving its goals and improving itself. From multi-tenantcy, to subscriptions and persistent transports. In this talk, I'll present the project and its goals, the current state of art, its capabilities and architecture, the tools available and the related maintenance cost.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

should be okay then

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:25,430
so fast forward to today's the car do

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:30,830
you know what scar is like couple finds

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,940
okay enough hands to be happy cool so if

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,610
you know what the car is you probably

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,739
know when Marconi was and and you

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,239
probably have heard a lot of the runts

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,210
in the community for the last two and a

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,670
half years probably three already before

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:48,380
I started my talk um few disclaimers I

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,290
literally just finish this talk so I I

00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,970
really have a few ideas of what I'm

00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,739
going to say but we're gonna go through

00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,469
what the car is today what PG

00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:02,540
implemented since we renamed the project

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,489
to a giving worst name and and I

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,050
normally speak very fast that's our only

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,700
I'm originally from South America so

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,090
that's what we do there unless you want

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,380
to get killed and I normal say but words

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,520
as well but i'm not going to rent a lot

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,080
today because I'm talking about my

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,390
bridge all the project work on was a

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,450
time so definitely not planning to rent

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:25,640
that much that's me my name is Flavio I

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,289
work another sack full time and I still

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,270
worked out right half the plan to go

00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:31,190
anywhere for now and thanks all for

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,800
being here have a couple of reasons why

00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,179
you might be here right now that's my

00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,220
Twitter handle and that's my email

00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:39,020
address if you want to rent about sacar

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,410
does that's probably where you want to

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,509
go or you want to join the basic RC

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,039
transaction courtesy chance so if you're

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,420
here you're probably just chillin or you

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,810
are having one of those weird days that

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,289
Monty mentioned and or you just want to

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,509
pickle about a HUD the car and just

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,250
waiting for the question session to run

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:02,539
about it and I make sure you don't have

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,619
time for that and always and if you know

00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,590
the current you're just happy with the

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:09,470
project then you're here just to hear

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,540
what's new on the project but either way

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,370
I'm happy you're here and if you're here

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,500
to huggle about heckle about the car

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,980
there's a cat here they say that it

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,739
makes people happier and nicer unless

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,819
other I hate Pat's anyway but I just put

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,670
it there because that's what people say

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,110
I hope that helps so now on topic it's a

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,350
car for the cloud and by cloud I'm a

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,790
rhombus I honestly

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,230
I don't mean the entire world i don't

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,910
mean that you will just use it for

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,410
whatever cloud you want hopefully you

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,530
will be able to that at some point some

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,330
day but that's the that's not like we're

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,920
blind eye we're focusing a lot on office

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,710
i can making it a good service for a

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,930
basic by of a second mean users of open

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,730
site or even up and suck itself within

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,600
the cloud well she will see some of the

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,120
use cases in a bit ah that's the mission

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,030
statement most of mission statements lie

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,380
a lot this one seems pretty accurate it

00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,550
was an accurate before and we're going

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,710
to go through some of the things that

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,690
weren't accurate going to read the

00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,080
mission statement for you but i do have

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,670
a tldr for you of what zack arias and

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,100
the car is a multi-tenant messaging

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,290
service it's being built by up as i can

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,570
for open set and we're still trying to

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,160
make it better for a sec what else i

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,250
have to say about the car it has

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,340
notifications built-in so if you know

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,410
SQS simple q services service from AWS

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,780
you know that there's also SNS which is

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,310
simple notification service you can

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,780
think about the car as those services

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,490
put together in a single service so that

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,730
you will get all the benefits from

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,010
having messaging service and like I'm

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,480
ship like I'm saying messaging services

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,010
are huge difference between having a

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,660
queue service and a messaging service

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,510
and the carries and messaging service so

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,400
that's one of the difference between the

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,630
car and SQS and there's second

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
difference and main difference is that

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,500
it has notifications built-in like we

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,080
want to build this engine this feature

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,420
that will allow you to push those

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,500
messages somewhere else and not just

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,830
have them in there in the service it has

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,440
message delivered guarantees and is

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,710
horizontally scalable and there's two

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,510
stars there and if you can't read these

00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:17,730
little tiny lines here algorithm for you

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,460
most of these guarantees depend on the

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,220
deployment what's or changing you are

00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,010
using for the car and and and how you

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,620
deployed so consult your favorite ops

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,110
person to make sure this guarantees

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,840
exists and if that's not what you

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,550
thought the car was if you thought it

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,200
was a replacement a replacement for

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,960
rabbinic um sorry to tell you it is not

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,340
if you throw it was a queue service I'm

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,560
sorry to tell you it's not

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,449
messaging service and if you thought it

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,810
was a replacement for imap it is another

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,610
plasma for ended I'm sorry Monty and if

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,139
you thought it was an email service it

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,330
is not an email service because it is

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,800
not even a rebuttal for imap it is a

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,229
messaging service and the thing they

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,910
wants to do is messaging so use cases

00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:06,030
I'm almost on the end of my talk and I

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,240
like 10 minute through just get it so

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,020
some use cases let's all sometimes when

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,310
when I'm talking about the car to people

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,410
but there's a lot of confusion about

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,760
what the car is actually doing what it

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,610
aims to do and they're like they're

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,320
well-known messaging services out there

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,940
queuing services like there's Robin in

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,520
queue there's a cubit that it doesn't

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:34,229
work as well but anyway this is me

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:36,300
recorded yeah there are other messaging

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,070
services I don't know zeromq which is

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,720
broken less and it has a whole lot of

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,780
features in it that are really amazing

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,250
exciting but again like messaging is

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,410
probably one of the fields in our

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,120
industry that has been exploring so many

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,990
different ways and broken in so many

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,630
different other ways so one of the ways

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,520
that I'd like to I like to explain the

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,620
car as it's just by presenting some of

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,990
the use cases who are trying to cover

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,760
and as I said this is being built for

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,180
the Claudian its case for it means

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,580
OpenStack so one of the issues one of

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,160
the use cases is just messaging I want

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,419
to mean Noah days when you have a cloud

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,430
when you had to point your client

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,389
application turned there with the

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,789
planning your application in the cloud

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,229
you most likely want to want it to be

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:20,760
distributed and you want to have a way

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,440
to communicate between your different

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,050
notes and have an easy way to that

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,910
without without having to install rub it

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,130
in queue maintenance killer which is the

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,490
which is really hard and most of the

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,560
times it doesn't work anyway so one of

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,389
the goal here is to just provide your

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,340
way to just have messaging right you

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,750
just tell your cloud provider hey I need

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,479
to send messages between these two nodes

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,039
or between these two piers whether

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,410
they're in the same cloud or outside a

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,849
club and and you want your cloud

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,770
provider to just tell you you know what

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,570
there's this service you just sign up

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,580
for you this multi 10 and it is your

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,790
your messages will be yours forever it

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,810
is

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,450
durable you're not going to lose

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,280
anything there's your URL just log into

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,530
a den send messages from one point to

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,270
another and that's one of the things

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,800
that's a car wants to do the car wants

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,510
to provide a way to send messages

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,190
throughout the cloud between your

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,870
applications you may are going to say

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,210
well you know there's this new cool

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,360
service called kill and it just you know

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,680
provisions message brokers for you so

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,600
you don't have to do it yourself and

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,910
it's true I mean if you're Klopp of

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,180
either gives you cue and gives you the

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,680
possibility to just deploy message

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,200
brokers by clicking a button that's

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,760
perfectly fine if that something that

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,020
you're taught over is willing to

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,280
maintain for you that's perfectly fine

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,310
it's a good replacement for soccer

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,540
honestly but if there's no the car is

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,220
the only one of the things that you want

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,990
to have it there to be able to

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,460
communicate between gical the difference

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,350
here is that you will deploy something

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:48,080
that has some protocol that you you have

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,460
to learn you have to adapt yourself and

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,870
since one of the things we want in open

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,300
sigan one of the things we've been

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,460
working hard to maintain and one of the

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,190
things that Monty always rent about is

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,960
interoperability between clouds oh this

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,120
is something that the car has kept us

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,220
part you know the whole design process

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,170
is being it repairable between clouds

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,240
you know having always the same API not

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,560
having a way to enable some end points

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,200
based on with your configuration or

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,220
whatever so the problem with Q here is

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,650
that if your cloud provider gives you Q

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,180
but it doesn't you know like the

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,860
underlying message broker that is being

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,570
deployed has it some random different

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,840
protocol that you will have to learn

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,300
it's not n QP for instance that my dumb

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,980
i turn on being a nice you and make you

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,080
our plication not interoperable between

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,300
different class but that's just just

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,960
just just a corner case that you might

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:44,190
want to keep in mind another use case is

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,250
having intercloud communications and we

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,200
have several services in OpenStack that

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,020
deploy lot depend on guest agents being

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,360
for individual machines that you run and

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,450
some examples that are Sahara trove and

00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,170
some others like felices heat as well

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,430
have some some agents running and one of

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,380
the things that one of the problems that

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,470
all these services have in common is

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,540
that

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,940
disqus agents need to communicate with

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,770
in with the under cloud and they need to

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,140
send messages to the service controllers

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:16,330
and they need to have a way to tell the

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,220
controllers Harry I'm up I'm ready or

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,990
send me some messages or send me some

00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,200
information to in order for me to be

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,180
able to keep going in the case of trove

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,910
is managing databases just reboot the

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,370
database do this and do that they all

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,610
have solved these issues in a different

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,470
way in the case of trove the insist that

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,510
you should have a different rabbitmq

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,880
running which is completely isolated

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,250
from the rest off from the old arab link

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,350
um you might be using for the rest of

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,790
your cloud which is totally fine except

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,740
that rub it in queue is hard to maintain

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,380
it has some extra costs and blah blah

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,690
blah blah and the other thing is that

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,660
rub it in queue is that has not doesn't

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,040
have any multi tenant multitenancy built

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,360
in which is something that the cardiff

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,700
only provides and that's something you

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,510
want to have in your guest agent if you

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,030
are running a multi-tenant lab whereas

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,220
sahara has fixed this by just running

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,720
ssh into the Machine and uploading some

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,020
files and having some communications

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,330
going through ssh which is very scary

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,650
honestly because if you think I'd your

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,300
about your virtual machine and your

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,490
guests agents normally those are

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,640
accessible by external users which means

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,380
you're exposing some of the informations

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,150
of your cloud to external users and

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,440
might get into the virtual machine it

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,300
really depends on the service understand

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,090
all the services allow you to SSH into a

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,430
guest anyway in the case of the car most

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,770
of time you need just a username and 10

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,590
and obviously and a password to login to

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,060
the service and send messages but for

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,730
the cases where you don't want to

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,000
provide those the car has a pre-designed

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,210
URL feature that we just develop and it

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,250
landed like three weeks ago honestly so

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,170
it's not been released yet but it has

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,360
been like we've developed that featured

00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,970
just for this use case or mail look for

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,440
this use case because you don't want to

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,750
give to your guests agents a username

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,910
and a password that users might read and

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,980
use elsewhere you just want to give it a

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,190
URL that you can just revoke easily and

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,050
i will give the user enough accesses and

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,420
you're even of permissions to just post

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,440
messages or just consumer

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,010
such as depending on what you want to do

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,420
and there is on saying is because this

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,519
this goes along with what I said before

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,709
which is that we've been building the

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,050
car for the cloud and with the whole

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,880
multi-tenancy and OpenStack in mind and

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,430
in order to make it a good messaging

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,519
service for it another use case these

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,399
are phasing messaging and notifications

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,810
so one of the other like another problem

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,660
that we have and we actually discuss

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,360
about this last time it is that we don't

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,100
have a good way a good story when we

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,220
need to send notifications back to the

00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,380
user so say something happens in the

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,089
story say something happens in the cloud

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,370
and you want to notify the user but

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,930
about what happens in the cloud we

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,699
currently have a nice way to do that and

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,290
to be completely honest like when we

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,940
started working on the car this wasn't

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,709
actually at one of the use cases but it

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,790
turn out to be a good use case for the

00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:19,019
car as well which we basically found out

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,310
like a couple of cycles ago when we

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,110
started looking at the issues that we

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,610
were having in and when we started

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,959
discussing about what the car is and

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,100
what it's not one of their and failures

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,839
of graduating but but definitely if you

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,190
want to have a user facing tification so

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,140
you can you can use the car because it

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,000
is multi-tenant and you it's easy to

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,670
just post a message there that you there

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,470
has to be visible by a certain amount of

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,610
users in a specific 10 our region so

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,589
that's one of the use case it has

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,680
notifications built in and users can

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,089
just go there to the to the notification

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,550
ski you and get messages out of there

00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,420
but it's not about polling and poland is

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:03,420
bad and we all know that so magazine

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,240
notifications is also second like

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,880
probably second biggest feature and or

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,810
part of the API that we focus a lot on

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,810
and one of the things that we we want to

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,829
get to is to have all these forms of

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:23,130
notifications developed an entry and so

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:26,010
far we have web hooks and email is on

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,779
the works right now and what I mean here

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,269
is having different ways to push

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,540
messages back to users so we want to

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,490
notify users when some

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,360
happens we want users to just configure

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,100
and register do some q's into some

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,440
messages to some streams of messages

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,610
depending on their needs and have those

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,569
messages going somewhere these are some

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,709
ideas probably stolen from also SNS and

00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:53,110
stolen or borrowed it's probably a

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,339
better term from SNS and they have

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,930
support from us of this and this is

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,060
something that we also want to have in

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,220
the car so have a way to email the user

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,170
when some messages arrive to the queue

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,009
with the content of the message or just

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,630
call a URL and just post a message there

00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,790
depending on the configuration or even

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,430
send an SMS or just send it to the AP

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,410
and the mobile ATM and make them message

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,750
appear in their mobile phone these are

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,250
all things that are fairly simple to

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,740
implement first people to support once

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,360
you have the whole engine running under

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,009
the hood which is one of the reasons why

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,839
we decided to have full services in a

00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:27,670
single service because you can get the

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,050
most out of whatever you have under the

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,329
hood of the storage engine you are using

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,529
and you don't have to have two different

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,560
service communicating with each other

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,120
which makes it way simpler we know when

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,350
a message gets in we know when a message

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,060
has been deleted we know where the

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,010
message at spire so we know when do we

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,589
want to push the messages to the users

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:52,319
based on the computer configuration

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:54,639
transport real quick up so the car is

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:57,730
which is probably one of the cool things

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,260
and probably also wanted to really bad

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,319
things about the car and is the fact

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,480
that is it's very pluggable in both

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,399
areas you can have different transports

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,329
and the transport is the way you

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,339
communicate to the car it might be HTTP

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,920
or web socket and we're going to talk

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,899
about that a little bit more and Oracle

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,649
also be whatever transport you want like

00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:22,540
a dro tcp or or even a QP one point 0 if

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,720
you prefer it really depends on what you

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,509
need and and it also has support for

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,459
different search engines it currently

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,189
has support for going to be and readys

00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:36,160
and there's virtual slave in support for

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:37,449
swift as they start changing so if you

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,310
already have Swift deploying in your

00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,480
your cloud you can just use that your

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,449
have to deploy I'm going to be you don't

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,549
have to deploy ready or whatever

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,049
and you will get with Swift you'll get

00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:50,919
pretty much the same guarantees that I'm

00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:52,419
going to be supposed to give you and so

00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,980
I'm saying like this is probably one of

00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,899
the good things about the car and also

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,059
probably one of the biggest problem it

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,100
has it is because it's not opinionated

00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:02,439
in any of those areas which makes it

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:06,339
really difficult to guarantee the things

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:07,509
that it wants to guarantee so one of the

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,669
transports in the main transport that

00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,189
we've been working on is h to be and it

00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:15,309
has where inversion to you now of the

00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:16,749
API and the reason we're like we had we

00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,089
have a version warning we have a version

00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:24,069
1.1 and the version 1.1 just have some

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:25,899
like backwards compatible fixes that

00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:28,179
came out of discussions and then version

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,829
2 is pretty much the one of the clothes

00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:31,329
are the whole story about the car and

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,889
the fact that is not a queue service and

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,439
it removes some guarantees that it used

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:38,019
to have and it probably makes the whole

00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,669
thing clear and again it's not a

00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,679
periphery p I there's a lot of work to

00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,559
go to to do there but it's just a

00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,999
whiskey up it's not it's not a you don't

00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,470
run the car server in your production

00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,850
environment you just have a whiskey app

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,069
that you will use with whatever whiskey

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,259
container you want to use we don't want

00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:55,149
to dictate what we continue you should

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,939
use in your your production environment

00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:01,779
that being said it's just HTTP it uses

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:04,059
falcon framework and it's pretty restful

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,029
api honestly and then we have web

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,380
sockets which is not a one hundred

00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:10,299
percent implemented honestly there's

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,610
part of the API implement already but

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,949
that's something that we're working on

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:16,779
and the reason why we are working on web

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,850
socket is because we want you to be able

00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:21,250
to post messages from every much

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:24,549
anywhere and buy anywhere in this case

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,319
we mean we're focusing a lot on the

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,819
browser we want you to be able to

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,070
connect to the car from your browser

00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,409
without having to go to the shell and

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,330
you know take Decker client and write a

00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,450
lot of code or whatever we want you to

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,130
just use a javascript bindings and just

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:44,019
post messages using your browser without

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,279
having to even use the HTTP API and one

00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,480
of the reasons we hired socket is

00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,740
because we want to have persistent

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,000
connections to the server so you don't

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,830
have to connect every time you want to

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,510
send a message you want to just open a

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,050
connection keep it open and stream

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,070
messages from into the car

00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,320
and again this is something that we've

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,050
been working on there's a lot to do

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,970
there still but part of the API it has

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:08,800
been implemented already and hopefully

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:12,340
we're ready for for the Liberty cycle so

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,730
guarantees before we get into guarantees

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:18,430
ah let me stress it a little bit more oh

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,990
the guarantees depend a lot on what on

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,200
how you configure its occurring how you

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:26,440
deploy and and it really hurts me every

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,180
time I say this but it is true so keep

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,800
that in mind it depends on what sort of

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,660
changing you use if you're using radius

00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,930
and you don't have any persistence

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,820
enabled in reddy's jakarta car has no

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,500
way to guarantee that your messages are

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,110
not going to be lost if Freddie's goes

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,270
down you're likely going to me to lose

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,430
all your messages so it really depends

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,720
on how you deployed the car and because

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,450
what the first one is message durability

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,730
so the car wants to guarantee that

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,340
you're never going to lose ever ever

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,730
ever ever ever going to lose your

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,200
messages and it tries to do its best I

00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,800
guarantee in this for instance if you

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,510
run the car on top of MongoDB and mon

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,940
going to be the right concerns among

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,920
going to be our no higher or equal to or

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:13,600
the maximum number of your deployed

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,180
slaves or or shards then it will

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,880
complain it will just cry and crush it

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,720
won't allow you to run zachary on top of

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,920
a nondurable mugabe deployment and

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,390
always you explicitly go to the

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,740
configuration say hey I know what I'm

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,660
doing just run and stop crying and

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,460
you'll do the same that Justin knows but

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,590
also the broader concerns of every

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,570
request it does is to my going to be and

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,670
I'll make sure that messages are written

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,260
before it replies back saying that

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,270
everything is okay on the server side

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,050
and pretty much the same thing will

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,400
happen with Swift although Swift ships

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,250
had different guarantees from the south

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,220
side and it's basically built with

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,020
durability in mine and make sure that

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,640
you're never going to lose any record in

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,310
there but in the case of radius we don't

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,660
have a good way to provide that so we

00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,040
have this thing called storage

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,350
capabilities that you can you cannot

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,770
modify but you can introspect so you

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,440
know

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,290
what storages are running behind opens

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,760
up sorry behind the car you know what

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,280
guarantees are provided by your cloud

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,610
provider or but that's a car instance

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,440
specifically it has a list once

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,390
guarantee and the list ones guarantee

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,690
depends on the durability if durability

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,210
is not enabled enabled then you this

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,470
this cannot be guaranteed by the API ro

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,460
and yeah that's pretty much everything I

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,140
have to say about all this one's

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,910
guaranteed so at least once basically

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,080
means that if your message is once they

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,420
hit the service they were going to

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,460
deliver being sent back to one of the

00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,900
consumers at least once before they are

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,250
deleted and at least one is it because

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,780
one of your consumers can get the

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,370
message and then a Couture deleted from

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,120
the server and that would be just one

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,910
Wow one delivery but again if durability

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,980
is not something that I that specific

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,850
deployment has then there's no good way

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:08,950
to guarantee these once and only ones

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:11,200
the livery and again if you've been

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,270
around messaging war and you like read a

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,180
little bit about ones and only once you

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,970
know that it's practically impossible to

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:23,320
guarantee these but I still wanted to

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:26,710
put it there and say that the car has a

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,530
thing called claims which is what you

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,240
would use to go to the API and say hey

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,650
look these set of messages for me

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,260
because I'm one I want to be the only

00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,570
one consuming those and that way you

00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,860
will say give me 10 messages and make

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,300
sure no one else is going to work on

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,970
those and I'm going to be the only one

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,530
the problem with that is if I'm the

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,270
consumer and I get those messages and

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:52,390
then I crash there's a shot it's pure

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,190
exploration time on the claim so the

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,650
messages will be released at some point

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,900
and on some other consumers might go

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,000
there and just work on them but once

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,990
I've gotten those messages the car has

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,820
no way to guarantee that that specific

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,060
message at first messaging in that claim

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,250
has been worked out or not so if I fail

00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,230
to crush working on the second message I

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,870
got from that claim and I haven't

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,760
deleted the first one and then a crash a

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,370
second consumer can just go there and

00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,450
get another set of messages with the one

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,610
I already work

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,730
turn and still do the same thing is to

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:30,210
do the this process it as well so

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,890
there's no good way unless there's a

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,750
better communication between clients and

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,090
the server to provide once and only once

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,090
guarantee but when you read this in the

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:42,280
car world or related to the car it just

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,440
means that you have a way to log

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,240
messages and make sure that no one is

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,510
going to work on that while you're alive

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,550
and while your will like ready to to

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,140
work on those messages so once you act

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,340
those messages when you delete once you

00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,930
delete those messages from the server

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,920
you're good to go and you make sure that

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:01,750
no one has worked on those it has

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:08,260
horizontal scaling again just something

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:10,510
depends this is really depends on on how

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,800
you deployed and the current the reason

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,020
it depends on how you deploy the car is

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,150
because if you haven't deployed your

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,460
search engine in a way that it can scale

00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,910
or if you're among good behavior you

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,370
might say the manga didn't scale

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,850
infinitely animal it might die at some

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:31,480
point that's that's that's quite true

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,250
honestly but it really depends on what

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,110
you have the car running on top of and

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,880
and if that thing that the car is

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,820
running on top of fails and and it

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,040
cannot scale horizontally to infinity

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,260
and beyond danger cart cannot do the

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,660
same but when you read horizontal scale

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,390
and car are related to the car we

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,970
literally mean the API so it's a car is

00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,950
mostly the API and that's what we work

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,330
on most of the time we spent a lot of

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,400
time at the very beginning working on

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,250
the search engine and we've gotten to

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,930
the point where we have to and now we're

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,060
going to have the third storage engine

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:07,180
in the code base and that we maintain

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:09,280
and and our focus have moved completely

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,680
to the API and provide a better use case

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,320
for for for the cloud and provide a

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,060
better experience for the users so when

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,190
you r a horizontal scaling we mean the

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,350
web heads and and the fact that you can

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,270
add as many web heads a genie as you

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,820
need and as long as you keep your story

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,820
changing which we expect you to know how

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,980
to deploy and maintain and because you

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,960
picked on or you're just starting and

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,790
learning but anyway we basically mean

00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,890
that you can scale the cards dentally

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,670
the web heads and you can

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,980
as many as you need and and it refers to

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:44,640
not just the HTTP one but also the web

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,900
second one but again it really depends I

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,640
mean you still have to scale your

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,560
storage engine you cannot just deploy

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,150
the cardium pretend that is going to do

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,750
everything for you and one of the things

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:58,350
that we've built to make that simpler is

00:24:53,750 --> 00:25:03,180
called pools so in the car you have this

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:05,880
concept of pools were one pool points to

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,080
a specific deployment of MongoDB and

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,300
another pool can point to another

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,440
deployment of Mon going to be so if you

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,180
are using I'm going to be and you're

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,040
having you know that you cannot scale

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,950
that manga the beam stands beyond what

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,020
you scaled it already you might want to

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,060
deploy either another one and this is

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,950
not exactly the reason why we have pools

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,340
is just another like side effect of how

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:29,460
you can use them to scout it's a car

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,440
cool thank you and and then you will

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,180
just start keep adding pools and another

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,730
new sort of changes and you start

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,670
climbing sorry that you can sit on top

00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,440
of but the real reason why we wanted to

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,970
have pools because when we wanted also

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,440
to give the opportunity to deploy

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,070
different search engines and provide

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,810
different couple days so not all the

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:51,780
messages that you post in the car need

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,850
to be persisted and need to have the

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,980
same guarantees so you may want to have

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,440
different flavors flavors on top of

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,720
those pools and say that you have this

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,340
pool that is not durable at all and use

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,230
that pool for messages that are not

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,210
meant to be persisted and then you have

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,160
your pool where everything is persistent

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:13,530
and it's never never never never going

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:16,080
to be lost it's been built to provide

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,990
the maximum latency possible since like

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,470
a joke but it's kind of not a joke and

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:25,140
what I mean by this is that it is not

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,910
trying to compete with Robin and qu on

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,130
low latency it is not trying to compete

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,750
with other message brokers and messaging

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:36,180
systems in latency why's it does try to

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:39,180
have the lowest latency possible and

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,100
that means making the API as fast as

00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,920
possible and making sure they sort of

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,740
changing is configured in a way that it

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,269
does not turns out to be a penalty for

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,369
the whole service

00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:52,289
the main goal again is not to provide

00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,820
the service with the lowest latency

00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,709
possible but to provide a service that

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:01,349
you can post messages to and then you

00:26:55,709 --> 00:27:06,959
can make your cloud rely on my 50 if

00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:09,080
used to provide fi fo building and this

00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:12,119
caused a lot of confusions and

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,849
reasonable confusions honestly and it

00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,979
now doesn't provide a fifo anymore as

00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:18,539
the built-in guarantee and always

00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:21,570
present guarantee it's an optional thing

00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,999
so if you want to have a 50 first and

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,249
foremost your search engine has to

00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:28,229
provide a file like if you're using a

00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:32,009
storage engine that is not capable of

00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:34,349
guarantee if I fall I creddies then you

00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:36,899
then the storage 11 like you won't be

00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:40,139
able to create an fi fo pocket so to

00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:43,459
speak but again the default is not

00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:46,109
having a 50 if you if you really need I

00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:48,149
don't want to say Q I normally call them

00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:50,789
topic because that's that's how I reason

00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:53,639
about the messages were what the

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:56,009
messages are stored in the car but they

00:27:53,639 --> 00:28:00,239
used to be Q's they used to be called

00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:01,919
cues in the past when it was Marconi so

00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:03,269
if you if you really need a fire for you

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,190
can just enable and say like you know

00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:08,249
what these messages here should go to

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:13,889
this topic call my order topic and it

00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:15,450
has to be a fifo ah problems we have

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:16,559
several problems probably the first

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,259
problem we have is that we don't have

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,489
enough people what can I there's there's

00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,570
like probably can counter with my hands

00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:28,619
on a certain amount of people are

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:30,739
working on service and then like moving

00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,599
the car forward and making it like

00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:35,459
completely really ready for the cloud

00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,029
and consumable by other services as

00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:41,159
being hasn't been easy but I think we're

00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,899
getting there some of the service are

00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:47,099
already adapting the car during the

00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:50,459
liberty cycle which is really cool other

00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,659
problems it is it is not opinionated in

00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,969
some places where it should be

00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,099
opinionated which causes a lot of

00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:57,080
confusion it causes different

00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:59,540
configuration

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,920
then like I used to explain the car as a

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,170
lego brick because you could basically

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,780
build it as you wished but that turned

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,030
out to be a real problem for us and and

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,590
and also to it so it's playing what we

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,230
wanted to provide into our to provide a

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,630
good service and a good idea so that's

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,730
been changing and we've been focusing

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,320
more on the API with me focusing more on

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,850
making it a good messaging service and

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,830
removing all the confusion around

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:26,840
whether it is a cue service or not and

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,460
again it is not a key service this is

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,750
the node demo break because I don't have

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,340
any demo right now because I don't

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,920
believe in demos so i'll give you like

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:38,390
five seconds to imagine the car running

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,830
and me doing demo step work and if you

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:43,580
don't want to imagine anything you can

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:47,420
just look at it spiderpig working on the

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:53,690
roof of homers house and and that's

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:55,460
pretty much it questions there's 10 here

00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:04,880
as long as you don't ask anything I'm

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:06,470
good so I can i can understand neutron

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,950
having lots of plugins because you know

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,240
grace people have an invested set of

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,190
networking hardware that they want to

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,680
support and i can understand storage

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,690
same sort of deal and and less so in

00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,880
Nova but I guess people want to use

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,700
particular proprietary hypervisors and

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,870
other people obviously don't want to in

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,220
your case the plug-in seem to be

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,890
choosing between different free software

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,150
projects why support more than one

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,730
particularly if it means different

00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,760
semantics exposed to the user that is

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:38,300
actually a very good question um so

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,440
there's a history behind I probably the

00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:46,610
first reason why we went down the road

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,710
is because open side well when we when

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,780
we started working on it there was there

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,780
wasn't any big tent and and things were

00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,880
a lot different in OpenStack but I'm not

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,190
gonna look so one of the reasons because

00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,170
up inside used to be or is still a non

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,610
opinionated project right so we don't

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,200
want to dictate what you should use or

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,620
you shouldn't use and you're sort of

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,870
like if you look at Nova ignore the

00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,650
hypervisor side if you look at the data

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,950
base side

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,650
like everyone is using MySQL but the

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,420
like the reality the projects actually

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:21,800
using SQL alchemy which would probably

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,480
allow you to also use photos SQL yeah

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,550
right but that's not exposed to the user

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,990
so that's it like an internal deployment

00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,430
choice in your case from what I gather

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,790
from talk right now they tell you chose

00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,170
the climate choice like but I have

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,610
different we're in your cases the

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,950
behavior like some of the subtleties

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,330
around killing brain and so you have to

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,890
query capabilities as suddenly you've

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,380
actually got three different sacar

00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:46,070
writing on what so the second reason is

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,540
that we also wanted to at some point we

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,610
also thought about sitting on top of

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,050
existing messaging technologies because

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,760
we didn't want to reinvent the whole

00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:56,090
will and we ended up like Peru maintain

00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,800
it a lot so we wanted to sit on top of

00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,080
DC message in technologies like rabbit

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,120
in queue and and other brokers and just

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,140
make it easier for you to consume those

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,820
brokers from a user perspective at some

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,470
point we ended up like when we started

00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,750
working on that we figured out that our

00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,760
API was different enough from from

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,960
whatever the service provided and this

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,410
case rebeling key which is the one we

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,020
try to and it was different enough to

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,970
not make any possible to actually sit on

00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,520
top of that so to answer your question

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,740
we could make a note in your native

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,120
choice now and say you know why we're

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,980
not going to support any other sort of

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,800
changing and just provide one thing and

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,690
that's something that's been running in

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,210
my mind for a couple of cycles already

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:41,150
and and probably the reason I haven't

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,640
had the guts to just go out there and

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,170
propose it is because i know we have

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,420
bigger problems right now from the API

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,310
perspective and the adoption perspective

00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,620
that just go in there and saying you

00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,020
know what we decided that you cannot

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,370
choose your own database and we're going

00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,340
to spend this whole cycle removing that

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,830
thing we penalize a project from an

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,110
adduction perspective so for instance in

00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:06,590
the Liberty cycle we said no to

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,330
basically everything but adoption so we

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,820
went to different services and we said

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:15,230
so what is it that you need that we

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,880
don't have to you know to make it

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,440
possible for you to consume the car and

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,240
that's what we've been focusing on right

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,320
now I think that's something I that's

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,370
something that might happen in the

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,380
future but

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,510
and it has to just be it has to be

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,180
proposed and we have to bend light stuff

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,830
but like I agree with you that's more

00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,360
like it that's been more a problem for

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,520
us than that knife and that is you see

00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,590
casting it you see that in other episode

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,850
projects to we r I mean you should we do

00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,340
different free software projects really

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:46,610
yeah i mean it would make designing the

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:48,350
API way simpler honestly hmm yeah like

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,270
again like in deliberate cycle we just

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,540
we've been focusing on adoption right

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:57,160
yeah exactly oh if you here on monday we

00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,160
can help you talk to delete command sir

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,640
