	00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
well the wall is out of the way

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,860
everybody is sitting no not everybody is

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,689
sitting down but maybe they could sit

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,430
down so we can make a start it is

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:25,660
lightning talks time this is my favorite

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:27,880
part of PyCon we have currently at least

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,039
nine talks today on various topics

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,840
they'll go for about five minutes if

00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,330
you've not seen lightning talks before

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,580
we like to keep a really tight ship so

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,410
there is a timer it's sitting on this

00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,570
electron here and you people in the

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,120
middle we'll see when it's starting to

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,130
hit zero when it gets close to hitting

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,660
zero I need you to applause and make it

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,350
impossible for everyone else in the

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:56,500
audience to hear the person on stage so

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:59,020
can we get a practice for this great I

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,850
can't hear myself so this is working

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,379
really well great that means we can keep

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,210
a tight ship because you will stop

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,810
applauding once the person has stopped

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,550
speaking which is great so our first

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,770
presenter is Marcus Holderman who is

00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,450
going to be telling us all about Django

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:27,000
log in Canary please make him welcome

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:27,000
and start the timer so yeah

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:40,960
keep talking um Joe Burton ask any of

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,000
them do doing what my master thesis over

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,130
the last couple of months I had some

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,960
time apparently otherwise I wouldn't

00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,660
have done it next to my time as the

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,500
jungle core contributor and i wrote a

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,590
small library where you can get notified

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,860
if your users oh your users get notified

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,920
if somebody tries to log in on their

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,020
account or somebody failed to login it's

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,670
called jungle or in canary and what you

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:14,140
can do is this example project um when

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:17,590
you go to localhost you log in and when

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,500
it works you see that you get an email

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,340
that tells you everything is fine so

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,739
what happens if you look out mr. button

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,610
over there and you're try to login again

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:32,500
and you tie the wrong password well of

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,660
course this doesn't look but you also

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,810
get another notification words from

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,980
somebody tried but failed well of course

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,140
if you supply a wrong username and it of

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,290
course doesn't work but you also don't

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:55,930
get there's no message then okay that's

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:58,600
all okay so up next on the other side we

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,260
have t Mansell on deck over this side we

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,570
have a Russell Keith McGee oh let's

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,410
start Tim who apparently still has too

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,890
many projects ah that's on the wrong

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,890
screen

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,300
yes I do and I'm running out of time

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,390
this one again so last year I gave this

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,220
talk and I'm giving it again and I'm

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,300
over here for all the people still

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,239
looking in that direction so yeah I need

00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,500
really to sleep so I could really use

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,450
some help on these projects that thing's

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,180
tack on during the Sprint's if you're

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,180
around I'm quite happy for you hack on

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,600
them anytime not just the sprints the

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,030
first thing is if you're using dates in

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,700
Python you should care about time zones

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,560
and so this is a library which deeply

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,450
cares about time zones and is a drop-in

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,410
replacement and gives you a whole bunch

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,239
of extra functionality to kind of coerce

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,530
people who don't really understand time

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,110
sensor thing now it has python3 support

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,950
so if that's been stopping you you can

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,470
use it on Python 3 it also has windows

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,130
support so if you're using Windows for

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,460
some reason I can't fathom you can now

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:28,370
get proper time zone support with Python

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,720
datetime TZ um who here knows what Q is

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,669
I'm not seeing many people so I'm going

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,710
to stop here for a little bit it's

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,960
basically quick and dirty debugging

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,890
output for tied programmers it's

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,880
basically a fancier print statement I

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,580
didn't write it a really wonderful

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,950
person wrote it you basically import you

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,740
then like you can queue something can it

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,310
goes to a log file and temp q you can a

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,470
queue a function it gives you like the

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,890
inputs and the return arguments from it

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,520
i tooked up maintainer ship for because

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,440
it wasn't being maintained and it now

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,419
has Python 3 spot too so you can use

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,300
their own Python 3 and it has tests I

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,550
also working on tim's videos which is a

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,180
bunch of projects and there's lots of

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,680
lots of python so this is the hdmi to

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,849
USB it's a capture solution for

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,630
conferences like this to capture video

00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,010
and I

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,870
trying to see how much time I've got

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,550
plenty of time this is kind of cool

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,730
because it's a piece of open source

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,220
hardware and you're probably wondering

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,210
why I'm talking about this at a Python

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,180
conference and we now have Python based

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,480
firmware for this video recording device

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,550
and it's on a thing called me Jen so you

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,100
still need to know some stuff about

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,910
hardware but instead of writing horrible

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,160
Verilog or VHDL which is an absolutely

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,360
atrocious languages you can write Python

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,890
and actually works pretty well so we now

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,720
have a firmware that's in Python that

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:14,670
you can help out with we also have a

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
piece of open hardware this is something

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,050
I've been working on for the last two

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,690
years it's called the new man to opus

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,400
and it's basically fully opened

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:28,860
schematic firmware PCB and you'll be

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,110
able to buy one tune so you can go to

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,840
bit ly get opus and we'll e-mail you

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,900
when you can buy one and you have full

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,700
access to all the information about it

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:46,290
so open as well there's a lot more going

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,850
on slide lint is another one I've seen a

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,580
lot of atrocious slides at this

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,880
conference with fonts that are like this

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,650
big I can't read that even when sitting

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,170
in the front row so you should use slide

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,220
lint sliding it tells you about all the

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,680
problems you have in your slides so this

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,310
is kind of the slides lint run on my own

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,100
slides we have a website version now so

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,940
you don't have to run it on the command

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:22,710
line we would love help making this

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:24,420
website less bad so yes we would love

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,750
and it's all written in Python and you

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,080
can kind of see that my own slides don't

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,610
validate so I'd love help with that

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,400
that's all where you can get code and

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,640
stuff there's plenty of other things

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,500
like it was developed by a non-english

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,840
speaker so the English is

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,130
even that great which is kind of bad on

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,790
something that's telling you your

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:51,210
english isn't great so would love help

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:54,660
with that we also have a live video

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,730
mixing software has very strong python

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,720
api and there's also a fully Python

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:04,620
version again python python python

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:10,500
streaming system lots more please help

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:14,100
me i need like stop stop stop sauce i

pike on are you for six years now and

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,790
tim has given this talk at five as well

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,650
as like the last ten lcas please work on

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,930
his project so you can stop giving this

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,750
damn lightning talk and wasting our time

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,490
with it up there all on deck so we have

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,650

over there and up next we have another

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:37,310
bloody academic wanting it to tell us

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,310
about his titles please make him welcome

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,159
thank you ok so um I am a ten-year

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,450
veteran of the Django of the Django core

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,100
team I'm a member of the Django

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,300
technical advisory board and i'm

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,190
president of the django software

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,810
foundation i am the founder of the

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,120
beware project to project looking at the

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,500
tools we use to develop python big part

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,030
of be where is toga cross-platform

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,920
widget toolkit that allows you to build

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,900
native iOS and Android applications in

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,950
Python be wearin toga or both works in

00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,450
progress but if you're interested in

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,640
Python development tools or Python our

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,010
mobile come have a chat with me i'm also

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,720
a CTO co-founder of a startup company

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,089
with all the pressures and stresses that

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,630
come along with that and i'm also a

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,130
doctor I'm not that kind of doctor my

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,930
doctorate is in computer science my

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,700
doctoral thesis was entitled models of

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,580
learning and development in kohonen

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,010
style self-organizing feature maps the

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,140
reason I say this is I'm not a medical

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,900
doctor is because this is not medical

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,820
advice it's personal anecdote but I hope

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,560
that by sharing I encourage other people

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,560
to do something that I didn't do for a

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,500
very long time you may have noticed I

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,270
have my fingers in a lot of pies I've

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,550
got a stressful job I volunteer with

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,170
Django I've got side projects i also

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,480
have a son with learning difficulties in

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,010
a daughter and a wife and over the last

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
few years the combination of these

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,710
stressors really started to take its

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
toll

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,400
my temper started to get short I found

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
myself getting frustrated both with

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,780
myself and with others I found myself

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,550
doubting my own abilities not just

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,520
imposter syndrome level stuff either a

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,230
genuine belief that I was incompetent my

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,060
enthusiasm to go out and socialize with

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,160
friends was reduced picking up the phone

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,570
to organize to go with a friend to go

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,000
over for dinner or to go out for dinner

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,140
just felt like too much effort and I had

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,900
some intermittent health problems

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,310
especially with my back and shoulder it

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,140
wasn't constant and it wasn't a

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,850
continuous decline I had good days I had

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,160
bad days I had good weeks I had bad

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,160
weeks but this pattern has been going on

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,460
for about 18 months but in about

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,050
mid-march I hit rock bottom I woke up

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,750
one Wednesday morning went into my

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,630
office started work and by about nine

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,580
thirty in the morning I could not had

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,770
either have 19 any energy to continue I

00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,440
couldn't summon the energy to give a

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,870
damn about anything I went back to my

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,230
bed I buried my head in my pillow and I

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,240
cried that was the final straw for my

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,580
wife she pushed me out the door to go

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,930
see a doctor a medical one and I was

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,270
diagnosed as being in the middle of a

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,860
major depressive episode I'm being

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,720
treated now I'm at the start of my

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,310
treatment so it's a what notes there's

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,110
with way too early to declare the

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,210
victory but even in this short time I've

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,950
noticed a positive change in myself at

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,450
some level it's probably just the

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,070
cathartic release of knowing that what I

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,230
was feeling wasn't right and it can be

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,720
treated but frankly I'd take any

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,280
improvement i can get the reason i'm

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,290
going public about this is because in

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,450
retrospect i put off getting help for

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,100
far too long I didn't want to admit

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,840
failure I didn't want to attract the

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,940
stigma of admitting that I was mentally

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,500
ill successful people don't get

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,950
depressed successful people power

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,940
through successful people win and it's

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,710
ball studies universally agree that

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,390
depression affects at least one in ten

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,880
people in our general population it's

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,920
hiring some demographics our industry is

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,810
particularly prone to the tune that

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,930
discussions about burnout are an almost

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,820
constant undertone I want every single

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,640
person in this room to know that you're

00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,130
not alone I am by almost every

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,290
conceivable public measure a successful

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,530
member of this community and I have

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,120
depression my plea to every single one

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,490
of you don't ignore the

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,830
signs don't put off getting help if

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,720
we've even got a vague feeling you might

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,839
be depressed or suffering from burnout

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,700
seek help because you don't have to feel

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,760
like this denying you have a problem

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,970
won't make anything better thank you

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,970
very much

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,060
thank you

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,060
that was a deeply important message and

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,990
thank you so much for sharing your story

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,690
Russell that was fantastic it is great

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,430
to hear that you are getting help now on

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:59,640
deck over this side we have Chris even

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,890
beaver even great okay so on this side

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,050
we have stephen joseph who has the

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,870
longest talk title apparently about a

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,770
sink i 0 TL DR edition I'm trying to fit

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:17,630
a full length talk in 25 minutes sorry

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:17,630
let's make a start yep start the timer

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:31,160
tick tick tick tick tick tick

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:51,060
no there's always at least one of these

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:18,269
does anybody else having a music

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:18,269
anecdote to share we're ready

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,519
ok

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,370
yay shall we restart his timer or no oh

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,120
yes okay your time starts now

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:09,790
so I'm gonna just go through it so see

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:11,079
10k problem don't panic basically I've

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,949
got a lot of means in there so it should

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,660
be fun so see 10k problems refers to the

00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,769
problem of optimizing network sockets to

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,019
have a large number of clients at the

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:26,160
same time okay yeah it can get really

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,910
messy concurrency versus parallelism

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,649
concurrency is dealing up with a lot of

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,899
things that the same things at once

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,370
battle is parallelism is about doing a

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:37,569
lot of things at once that's difference

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,189
subtle yes but look into it achieving

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,920
concurrency in Python there are two

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,420
popular ways one is G event event event

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,610
let green let and then there's a

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,709
synchronous code while like twisted I

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,600
think I oh and tornado yeah the two

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,850
things most popular one is of course G

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,019
event so what's the problem is even ok

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,910
so why bother we have G even

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,589
everything's good mini-cons everything

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:05,889
good great but in it involves monkey

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:08,559
patching so so this is what happened

00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:11,709
this is a man in some have interwebs

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:14,529
some some kind us Guido what's the

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:17,139
problem with using why do you want to

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:20,050
use explicit deals / co routines guru

00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:21,430
says I'm very fond of G ones not I'm not

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,110
very fond of G even not because a monkey

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,540
monkey patching of the machine level

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,889
hackery but also you could end up having

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,870
a possibility of tasks which is

00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:32,829
happening in be at random times

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,569
basically so he says well implicit yield

00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:37,449
approach may be problems in theory and

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:39,069
then Bureau says yes but I really don't

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:42,490
want to go into details trust me I have

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:44,740
a big scar somewhere ok and then glyph

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,629
ads in lift from to steady as in they

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,290
work up up to the moment they don't and

00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:53,379
I don't want to talk about either so TL

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,959
DR spooky action at a distance that's a

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,439
quantum mechanics reference you can hook

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,240
it up so basically that's the direction

00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:06,339
we're going the BD FL wants to go with

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:10,209
Python explicit was it implicit

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,709
concurrency it's an iceberg so explicit

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,240
concur c programming model based on

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,400
explicit cooperator multi-threading

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,960
wearin yield points

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:23,020
look visible locally that means you

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:28,120
explicitly say this is why you yield yes

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:30,370
too big so implicit current concurrency

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,260
with G event it wasn't supported on to

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:35,440
the patent 3 and no parental to the

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,820
morning so yeah so now recently they

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,470
have added support for Python 3 inch

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,090
even so here yeah so everyth coroutines

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,880
you probably have callbacks Winnie

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,930
callbacks so explicit concurrency with

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,660
callbacks is explicit so you say what am

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,220
I oh this is this is like explicitly

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,500
you're saying you're giving a function

00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,120
that will be called back when when when

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,190
data is available on the socket or over

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,780
explicit concurrency using pep 380 the

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,180
yield from statement makes it a lot

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,580
nicer so you can do a yield from which

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,130
is basically a generator you seals from

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,110
a generator internally but go into that

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,830
neck later on but basically this is how

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:20,230
it look like good as happy Thank You

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,790
beer so few implementations of that they

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,280
are a loop which are all there'll be two

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,460
state tornadoes enq loopy loop is not

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,350
exactly an implementation so goudeau

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,570
shad is sauce starting with this is an

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:36,070
incredibly important discussion so yeah

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:38,560
incredibly important discussion so so

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,720
the included one in Essen core is not up

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,180
to the mark he saying and Python 2.7 i

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,910
think in later on so if you got to do

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:49,810
something about it so leading up to a

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:52,510
python 3 a pep 3156 i think i think i

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,340
have supper rebooted so this is awesome

00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:02,070
module you should look into it one

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:09,160
minute ok so advantages of using that

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:11,350
would be so it's pure python 3.3 have

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,780
been probably available in later

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,850
versions also but this pure python the

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,400
reference implementation is tulip no

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,960
third-party modules no c code so you

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,580
should be able to run it on any pipe in

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:28,280
so the should fight and three

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,020
so the event loop invite in I think I

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,090
owe can be put into tornado it can be

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,180
put in this twisted so it's supposed to

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,350
be completely interoperable so you

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,100
should be shouldn't have issues

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,860
integrating into any in any library and

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:47,390
it gives you a lot of other new things

00:19:42,860 --> 00:20:02,050
but any yield from Bad 380 Shakespeare

00:19:47,390 --> 00:20:02,050
reference get off the stage come on oh

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,530
so I take it there's a version of that

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,880
talk way we can actually hear all of the

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,410
all the things that you're going to read

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,300
off the slides some on the internet

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:18,250
there's a 30 minute version of it

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,250
somewhere if this is the very nervous

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:27,980
okay so over on deck we have as one ye

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:31,910
xu and over here we have speak about bit

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:36,440
ID authentication crisp even the time

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:39,140
starts now hello I'm Chris Bevan smiley

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,570
Chris on IRC Django's channel if you if

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,060
you frequent bit so I'm going to talk

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,650
about that idea authentication now I'm

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,720
quite involved in the Bitcoin community

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,020
and so this is something that's come out

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,550
of that but good idea is a open protocol

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,380
allowing simple and secure

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,540
authentication using public key

00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,570
cryptography and the cryptography that

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,820
is using is but coins elliptic curves it

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,240
really just uses a Bitcoin wallet to

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,970
sign to sign cryptographic at one in

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,410
once cryptographic and seeing that back

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,750
to some way option i'll show you what it

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,060
looks like later so this is what a what

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,830
a standard registration form might look

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,180
like you've got your emails and it got

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,070
some other stuff you're gonna put in the

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,130
password and got to put in the game um

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,050
so rather than filling in that but ID

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,290
would give you something we just scan

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:30,080
this on your phone so what this gives

00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:32,420
you is if you used the sways that you'd

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,340
have a ID that was just site was just

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,990
your public address it would be a unique

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,600
address for every site so there's no

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,010
cross-site issues there of people

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,270
stealing your data and sharing it around

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:47,840
and there's no passwords yay so let's

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:50,270
show how it works so first of all the

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,050
server provides a cryptographic URL and

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:57,340
so that's gotta in once and it that has

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,780
only ever used once and and that is

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,390
displayed in the form of the QR code and

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,690
then you're the usual grab out there

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,820
Bitcoin clients of it usually you'll use

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,320
a a mobile wallet because then you can

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,040
scan the QR code but there are ways

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:16,700
around signing up manually and so they

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,770
will generate a unique address well yeah

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,880
they generate a unique address based on

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:24,740
the domain and so based on that they can

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,330
post assigned response back using this

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,310
unique it going to dress that I've

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:32,030
created and that goes to the callback

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:34,730
URL and then you can use JavaScript and

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,990
stuff like that to to try it out so now

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm going to see if this will actually

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:50,330
work Oh roughly let's try it out okay so

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,280
we've got our here's a bit ID and I'll

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:58,520
get out my this is always the fun bit

00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:01,370
nobody use the internet for a second so

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,320
for example I'd just come along see if I

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,030
can scan this than an angle yep and it's

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,430
coming up on my phone saying that this

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,580
is the coined website and so I'm going

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:13,910
to sign into that so sending it out at a

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,900
few kilobits a second and once it's done

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,900
that I'm logged in so

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,570
so yeah the benefits of this you've got

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,910
the ability of having an out-of-band

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,260
authentication you can log in via an

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,610
untrusted computer because I didn't

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,410
enter my password into the system

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,880
obviously you've got a session that's on

00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,180
that computer but if you were through

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,310
https then you've got some reasonable

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,870
security bear on that there's no third

00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,720
parties this is getting sent between

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,400
it's just directly via HTTPS channel

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,520
through to the same server that you're

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,200
logging into your not technically I'm

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,270
actually that was an example where I've

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,130
got a user that's tied to that data but

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,480
you could do it just with the Bitcoin ID

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,000
and not story anything's you could just

00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,530
have anonymous data and so it's

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,560
resistant to brute-force attacks you've

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,380
got no passwords yeah so there are some

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,910
dangers and that you you've got to

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,170
protect your keys but hopefully if

00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,640
you've got a Bitcoin wallet on your

00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,310
phone or but going wild in general

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,370
you're keeping backups and taking

00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,840
general security methods you've also got

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,160
to worry about men in the middle of text

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,390
making sure that when you're satin and

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,920
you're actually signing into the web

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:25,000
side that you think you are otherwise

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,920
you could get in trouble and yeah

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,800
there's no way to in the protocol

00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,270
there's no way to revoke authentication

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,670
so you could do that via back Channel

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,760
ways if you have email what its own

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,890
number so yeah that's pretty much it you

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,870
can use it for example like i just did

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,610
as website authentication you'd probably

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,960
only do that in a bitcoin industry at

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,090
the moment that's a pretty small market

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,210
but yeah something like this technology

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,200
you could use for website authentication

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,180
two-factor authentication could be a

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,030
possibility or even something like door

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,040
access control for a lockers or hotel or

00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,440
something like that so yeah that's that

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,210
ID there's a python implementation

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,430
there's a demo you can try out yourself

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,620
at that between blue and this small so

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,400
some other similar implementations

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:14,980
called bit off and squirrels yeah thanks

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,270
I do like it when can you start slapping

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,280
under time so I can get through to our

00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,020
overflow talks as well we're not quite

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,290
up to those yet on deck on this side we

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:26,260
have amy marie and over to my left we

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,240
have to run you chew who's going to be

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,040
telling us about more stuff you probably

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,570
didn't know about and something that

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,880
people in Sydney really should know

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,140
about let's start right so who's here

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,640
who's here from Sydney cool this has got

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,020
nothing to do what I'm going to show has

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,120
got nothing to do with whether you're

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:48,790
from Sydney or not so um over here I've

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,490
just entered the Python 3 ripple let's

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:59,260
see what underscore returns ok maybe

00:25:51,490 --> 00:26:02,470
we'll just say hello and now what

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,650
underscore returns so basically

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,480
underscore returns the last evaluated

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,190
value in case you guys didn't know that

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,190
so that's number one number two I was

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:19,000
told that I did I didn't do my best in

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,200
making Python like Haskell so I'm going

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,280
to show you something that makes Python

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:29,800
more like Haskell X and access you know

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,960
so what is X X is the first value and

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:37,030
access the remaining value that's number

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:39,670
two the third thing I like programs that

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,860
are easy to reason about so let's say

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,990
last and we create something called

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:51,420
slice and we've said negative 1 and then

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:53,760
L is this and if I want the last item

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,680
there you go perfectly readable

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,240
understandable code now to the part

00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,550
where we talk about Sydney if you're

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,010
from Sydney there is Sydney Python first

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:07,200
thursdays every month and atlassian it

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:07,200
starts at 6pm see you there

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:20,210
okay so on deck to my left will be

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:23,720
resells more about next we have a memory

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:29,170
telling us about cyber terrorism or or

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,170
terrible code which will kill you first

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,250
try to you in English we are recovering

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,660
from a network connectivity issue this

00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,540

grounded in our hyper-connected modern

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,960
world I'm going to ask you what is more

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,950
of a threat and which will kill you

00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:01,760
sooner cyber terrorism or terrible car

trouble code in 1918 no red reported

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,570
that the u.s. was under missile attack

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,550
the problem was actually a faulty

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,940
circuit no one actually factored that

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,800
into the code in 1983 the Soviet Union

Iranian reported incoming us missiles we

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,010
are very lucky and fortunate the officer

00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,070

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,550
feelings and think it was a false alarm

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,540
initially the pilot was blamed but it

00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:01,250
was actually terrible code 2030 planning

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,290
software delivered different doshas

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,650
depending on the order in which the data

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:11,480
was entered five people were killed and

Rapids Michigan cost the lives of 8,500

00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,900
patients well on paper anyway they were

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,900
actually alive

00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,340
so we can see just from the just from

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,580
the small bugs that I've noted we see

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,450
that the real def spy terrible co2 78 we

00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:50,650
had a full stephs reported 8500 so far

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:53,830
no deaths by cyber terrorism software

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,380
will eat the world claimed mark anderson

00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:01,090
in the wall street journal in August

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:03,640
2011 as software eats the world quality

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,710
of code becomes not just important but

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,150
it is a necessity it is a necessity

00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,100
because we are not talking about

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:15,130
websites going down we are talking about

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:17,770
human lives here in the olden days at

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,380
least my olden days I'm older than you

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,940
think in the olden days infrastructure

00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,740
was built to have ninety-nine point nine

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,920
nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,120
nine nine nine nine up time modern

00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,500
containers and microservices

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,020
architecture allows us to design

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,880
infrastructure for failure we are now

00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:37,420
looking at our infrastructure and going

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,340
it's going to fail we need to architect

00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,740
our software for failure we need to

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,770
accommodate for failures software bug

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:48,960
should not be taking down systems we

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:54,180
need fault tolerant code design patterns

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,180
there are human lives at stake here so

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,450
how do we solve this well I'm going to

00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,830
put this out as a problem but I'm

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,510
putting this out is this is our number

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,790
one problem in the software programming

00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:06,550
world and what's going to help us well

00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,470
education is the key and you know what

00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:12,550
part of education is it is admitting

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:15,250
that we don't know everything it is

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,350
asking for help it is learning from each

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,510
other it is doing test-driven

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,280
development and we always talk about

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,770
continuous integration continuous

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,200
development blah blah blah I'm going to

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,780
say we need continuous quality control

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,809
we need to build our checks into our

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:38,200
release cycles thank you

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:38,200
is excited to be a programmer yeah I

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:46,129
love not killing people okay on this

00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:48,169
side of the of the room we have Roman

00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:50,600
juice so if you can come and set up and

00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,889
in the meantime we have Reese else more

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,399
who is going to be telling us all about

00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:58,580
what postgres can teach us about

00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,320
JavaScript let's go whoo hey how you

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,789
doin um can I get everyone to do a

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,389
collective are for my new puppy awesome

00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:10,309
thank you so anyway postgres has a lot

00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,080
of extensions you can talk to get you

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:16,179
can make HTTP requests you can talk to

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,330
Twitter so select star from Twitter ah

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:22,369
you can also you can also do javascript

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,509
so I'm going to give some examples as to

00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:27,289
what post gross can teach us about

00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:30,019
JavaScript first of all let's find out

00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:31,669
the type of not a number that's na n so

00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,019
if we select from this function they've

00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:40,519
created we can see that not a number is

00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:42,350
a number okay that makes sense wait what

00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,879
about the type of null if we have a look

00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:49,450
at the type of know we can see that it

00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:51,830
is obviously a object it's a bit strange

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:54,379
so that must mean that null is an

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,179
instance of object right or a class so

00:32:54,379 --> 00:33:03,049
let's have a look at that and we can see

00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:05,809
that it's not obviously this makes sense

00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,340
what about 0.1 plus 0.3 obviously it's

00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,220
going to equal zero point oh it's sorry

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,869
0.2 obviously it's going to be 0.3 so

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,249
let's look like that to have a look and

00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:19,009
we can say that it is obviously not okay

00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:20,690
this is not starting to make sense what

00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:22,429
about if we declare a bar of 0 and see

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:27,799
if it's equal to false it shouldn't be

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:29,690
well it is okay this obviously isn't

00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,429
looking useful empty array plus empty

00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,779
right in Python that's an empty array in

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:38,259
JavaScript it should be the same and

00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,259
it's not

00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:42,990
obviously this is going to throw us back

00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:44,429
a division by zero error same as the

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:52,499
array error that we just saw and we can

00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:53,639
see that it does not okay obviously this

00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:55,259
makes sense if we just want to return

00:33:53,639 --> 00:34:01,710
true and evaluate it we can have a look

00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:03,539
and said that it returns nothing well I

00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,100
mean POV eights kind of useless in

00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,240
JavaScript seeing seeing all those

00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,669
examples there but if you want to come

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,649
over to my talk tomorrow 140 I'll be

00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:13,550
talking about subjects like this and

00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:16,619
there will be no JavaScript featured

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,929
Chris how long do I have left two

00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,819
minutes 40 seconds well let's just have

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,020
a look at your face for the next two

00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,020
minutes and 40 seconds

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:37,090
I'd like to thank Microsoft for that

00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,550
fantastic photo no really ah ok on the

00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,760
on the left hand side once Reese unplugs

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:44,980
his laptop we have Quentin love it and

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,650
on this side over here we have a Roman

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,240
juste who's going to be telling us about

00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:58,930
Zed see build out forward pitiable

00:34:49,240 --> 00:35:01,360
builds let's start okay um I haven't

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,900
prepared any any slides I will have to

00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,250
do this sort of straight off the bat

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,610
basically this talk is dedicated to all

00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,590
packaged maintained errs who develop on

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,440
packages which are a bit more complex

00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:17,490
than just being installable by PIP and

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,370
I'm especially talking about

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:25,270
contributors who need more than just

00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:29,520
like three steps to create a sandbox or

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:34,600
development sandbox and all this is

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:37,330
perhaps for you if you use CC builder so

00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,190
what it does what I have here is a

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:44,620
simple Python package two additional

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:48,250
files in there that is a built out CFG

00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:55,990
it's a simple any config file and a

00:35:48,250 --> 00:36:02,710
bootstrap you run that bootstrap and it

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:09,760
bootstrap CC build up and you run bin

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:12,000
bin build out and it configures and it

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,820
configures your program it creates

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,100
additional console scripts and that is

00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:23,890
all driven by the configuration file if

00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:27,270
you know ansible then you might know

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:31,120
ansible as all split up by tasks and

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:34,360
built out is basically split up by

00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:39,520
recipes and parts the parts are being

00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:41,220
defined at the top and the US are

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,640
sequentially

00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,940
executed each recipe is doing its

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,430
dedicated step and each step can install

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:57,000
uninstall and do something additionally

00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,609
I'm remember but that's basically the

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,040
crux so what did what you can basically

00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:08,490
do I've just ran then build out an hour

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:14,790
can run my tests I can i can run

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:18,450
coverage analysis I can build my

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:20,849
documentation and if you have

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,859
contributors then that is really helpful

00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:25,560
for them because they can instantly hang

00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,420
on the code run their tests create

00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,859
coverage analysis change the

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:37,770
documentation and basically center pull

00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:42,570
request if you are more interested in

00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:46,830
using CC build out pi PI page builder

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,839
dork I'm Roman juste if you want to

00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,660
learn more about build out talk to me

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,349
come to my talk tomorrow about programs

00:37:51,660 --> 00:38:03,089
lives and how to build a slicer and

00:37:54,349 --> 00:38:04,740
that's about it thank you very much well

00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:06,330
the good news is we still we've got

00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,070
through our schedule talks but we still

00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,560
have two overflows and we're actually

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,150
got time to get through them so up first

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,250
we have Quentin Lovett who's going to be

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,230
telling us about our building robots on

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,339
this side on deck we have hawky so if

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,250
you can set up that would be fantastic

00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,830
as well let's start hi my name is

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:26,010
Quentin Lovett and I build robots for

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:28,680
fun at school we have a Robotics Club we

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:32,030
build robots out of Lego Mindstorms

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,890
we've come first in state three times

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:37,890
third in Nationals and have qualified

00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,760
for the internationals in Qatar this

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,760
November so

00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:49,090
ah these photos are a little bit

00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:53,970
outdated are these are the robots we use

00:38:49,090 --> 00:39:04,480
are 22 centimeters in diameter 22 hi and

00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:08,280
some demos that's how that's one of the

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,280
later robots for attacking

00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:23,869
there's sometimes a little foul play and

00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:28,299
the ball the sides are curved so Bulls

00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,299
do roll into the goals unexpectedly

00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:41,869
that part of code allows our robot to

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,450
reverse out of getting stuck with other

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,910
robots that gave us quite a distinct

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,369
advantages other robots would get stuck

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:54,859
on walls and then we could move into

00:39:49,369 --> 00:40:04,300
goals unfortunately we don't use Python

00:39:54,859 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh instead we use this drag and drop and

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:11,869
still going to turn turn turn turn turn

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,990
turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:19,609
turn turn into zone and then each of

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:32,980
those blue blocks links in to one of

00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:36,859
these modules and Wako and more and more

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,380
but these are completely autonomous we

00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:41,000
are not allowed to touch the robots once

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,220
they're on the field if we do need to

00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,780
make adjustments they're taken off for a

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:52,010
full minute so pretty much our robots

00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:55,280
find the ball are using compass and

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,500
infrared sensors direct the ball towards

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,500
the goal and score thank

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,600
so we have time for one last talk from

00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:15,720
hockey who is going to be telling us

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:18,270
about a youth pipe i really do it time

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,330
starts now ok sorry Vicky no crashed um

00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,370
ok so just use pie pie hello I'm amber

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,570
brown I've been doing talks etc this is

00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,960
my Twitter if you want to yell at me

00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:33,180
everyone yellow me I don't like all of

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:36,890
you yeah Ivan in production you should

00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:41,450
rarely just use pipe i rarely just do it

00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:45,420
it's faster it's better stronger etc

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:47,910
we're stuff punk song ever each other ok

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,840
so this is for example so the yellow

00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:55,470
orange line is C Python 2.7 the blue the

00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,180
blue bars are is pi PI less is better

00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:00,510
now you see that some of those are

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,050
dramatically improved and on the whole

00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:08,370
it's about seven times faster and it's

00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:11,460
getting better this is the graph pi PI

00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:13,110
2.5 pipe and tube for sorry wasn't

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,140
released i think late last year so there

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:18,360
are still benefits that they're getting

00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,360
twisted for one shows a real benefit for

00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:24,800
example the blue line is python 2.6 when

00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,840
we had our older built built bob and the

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,970
orange line our orange bar is a really

00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,970
old version of pie pie i'm updating a

00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:36,000
tablet Yuans it comes from cff I which

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:39,510
is better see extensions you can use

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,700
cryptography which is a pythons arguably

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,060
new crypto library to replace my crypto

00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,610
you can you even use psycho PG 2 which

00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,870
runs faster than the sea extension

00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:54,480
version pi nacl for your lip sodium

00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:57,810
Crippler needs pipe anessa ssl for your

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,410
ssl needs g event even works in it lxml

00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:03,990
works in it and sequel light now get

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,300
knows best it's very tuned it will take

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:09,960
your code it will find the hot spots and

00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,480
it will make them fast but it doesn't

00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,770
actually know best because you need to

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,290
tell us some things you need to tell it

00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:22,580
you need to tell it what you want to do

00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:24,440
now simple simple is generally fast if

00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,720
you write what you want to do rather

00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,700
than trying random performance hacks

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,010
which would work in C Python you will

00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,050
get much much much better jet code

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:39,260
because it can understand what you're

00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:41,660
doing things mostly work this is for

00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,390
example twisted bill BOTS there's 53

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,760
tests failing out of 3,000 so pretty

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,120
good most of them are think assumptions

00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,230
we've made about garbage collection and

00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,290
dictionary ordering and all things like

00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,300
that all minor things pie pie itself we

00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:59,180
actually run in production twisted

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:02,030
matrixes web website runs pi PI 2.6 and

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,560
we can hold a lot more connections open

00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:06,860
and serve things much faster than just

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:12,290
regular C Python and if you think it's

00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:14,960
broken well at least it's not jathan so

00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,580
please do use PI pi please try it out

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,410
please run your applications on it

00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:22,430
please if you have an open source

00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:25,130
project please add a pi PI builder to

00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:27,320
your Travis just let it fail if it does

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,800
fail but it's better to know that it

00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,020
does fail rather than having no one know

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,790
that so you can try it you can see if

00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,530
there's any low hanging fruit and you

00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,570
can do some performance tests and use

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:46,300
some benchmarks and see what benefit it

00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:49,070
can get for you thank you what's up

00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,270
we've had 11 fantastic lightning talk

00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,090
presenters let's give a round of

00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:55,150
applause for all of them

00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,150
you

00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,800
