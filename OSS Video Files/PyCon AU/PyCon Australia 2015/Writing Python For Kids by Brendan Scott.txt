Title: Writing Python For Kids by Brendan Scott
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	Thinking of writing a book? We are in the midst of a boom in interest in amateur programming, particularly among children. Brendan spent the most recent summer past using his blog python4kids.brendanscott.com as inspiration for a new project based instructional book, Python for Kids for Dummies (US release by Wiley this northern summer). This talk will provide an overview of the development cycle for the book both in respect of the book's content and the process involved in creating that content and shepherding it through the publisher's internal processes. 
Topics to be covered include engaging and negotiating with the publisher, the different functions provided by a publisher, project management of the writing, interacting with editorial and technical reviewers, integrating with an existing "house style", art requirements and cross platform issues. In relation to content, Brendan will discuss the thought that went into targeting the material to a kids audience and the challenges involved in structuring a narrative which wends its way through each of the concepts that need to be introduced and providing a motivation for each of them. This includes how the content was structured, what concepts were included and what were passed over, trying to balance material to maintain interest without overwhelming the readers, the tension between explanation and demonstration and how to remain mindful of the audience's limitations. The highs, the lows, the triumphs (getting it done!) and tragedies (whole chapters consigned to the pyre), it's all here.

	00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
so one of the most remarkable aspects of

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,050
the Internet

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,270
is the way that being open

00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,670
about the projects we're working on can

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,369
bring interesting new opportunities into

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,600
our lives so our next speaker

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:27,950
Brendan Scott discovered this firsthand

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,090
when while expressed interest in turning

00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,810
his Python for kids

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,820
blogging project into a published book

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,270
and he's here today to provide an inside

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,620
view of that process thank you good

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:45,649
afternoon everybody thank you all for

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,840
coming along this is about writing this

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:50,030
book Python for kids it doesn't exist as

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,250
yet it's due to come out officially is

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,840
due to come out tomorrow or it was due

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,219
out to come to come out tomorrow in the

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
States but that is now going to be

00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:59,750
mid-august or so there are sample

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,089
chapters at the front here if anybody

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,250
he's interested gives you some idea

00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:10,190
about the layout of the book you can

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:14,659
pick one up so what is it it's a book

00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,670
for kids it's about learning Python and

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,970
it's a book that I wrote over the last

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,130
summer it's aimed at young children I

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,470
mean 10 and up and I think 10 is

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,730
probably the lowest thing you would go

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:31,520
you'd have to be a motivated child to do

00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:34,190
the work at age 10 it's published by

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,480
Wiley blah blah blah I've just settled

00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,900
that so I don't need to talk it about it

00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,210
anymore

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,940
why did I write it well I wrote it

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,700
because I love Python and I really

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,070
wanted to share that love with everybody

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,600
that and the fact that someone asked me

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,360
whether I would be kind enough to share

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,890
my love with other people and those

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,440
people were wily they had seen a blob

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,060
that I had started writing about four or

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,680
five years ago called Python for kids

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,170
and not only did they see the blog and

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,340
think IG that's fantastic they have also

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,920
noticed that there's there a lot of

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,950
sales in this area of coding for kids

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,440
whether it's Python or Ruby or whatever

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,290
and so they were looking for somebody

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,800
who could write a book to fill their for

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,390
dummies stable and of course the

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,190
zeitgeist seems to be that everybody

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,510
thinks that children should be learning

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,580
learning to code so what was involved I

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,840
break it down into three separate

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,730
sections engagement design of the

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,500
curriculum and the execution which is

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,510
the writing and the engagement is

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,790
actually getting in contact with Wiley

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,470
with them getting in contact with me and

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,420
getting to a point where I could

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,640
actually feel confident that I could

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,880
start writing the book and not be

00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:02,270
wasting my time and these stages

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:05,120
basically went like that and so that's a

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,980
period of roughly 12 months of those 12

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,050
months three of them were sort of lost

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,740
because the initial fellow that

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:16,010
contacted me from Wiley left the company

00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,050
and apparently I didn't tell me didn't

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,490
tell anybody else that this project had

00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,430
started or was about to start or

00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,740
anything so the second phase was another

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,090
three months where they contacted me

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,890
again and said are you still interested

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,230
in writing the book and I said yes and

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,060
then we took off and that period of

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,580
three months was actually a lot longer

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,650
than I wanted it to be and the reason it

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,060
was a lot longer was because and I'll

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,890
talk about this again a little bit later

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,709
why he was really interested in a

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,450
detailed table of contents for the book

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,400
and while I was easy to put together a

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,080
high level project straight it's a high

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,000
level of the statement of the projects

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,860
which were involved the actual detail

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,170
was difficult for reasons that I'll

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,760
explain later there was a third there

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,580
was another period which was contract

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,170
negotiations which held me up forever

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,739
partly because I didn't want to do them

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,020
I kept pushing them off and and partly

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,770
because it's genuinely difficult to sort

00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,770
the contract out

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,590
and I did most of the drafting the

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,030
contra the content for the book within a

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,190
period of about four weeks four or five

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,470
weeks of a January and February this

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,290
year and since that time I've been into

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,350
these two final phases reviewing editing

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:35,640
and proofing about which I'll speak I've

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,560
told you that no no no okay so the only

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,750
thing I wanted to mention here is that

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,090
the editing involves two separate sets

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,420
of editing a technical review and an

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:51,450
editorial review and at the end is a

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:53,640
proofing a proofing step now of all of

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,400
that I found the hardest thing to do was

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,280
designing the curriculum for what

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,780
exactly was I going to cover in this

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,700
book and I did it was the hardest part

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,700
of the process and I said while he

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,870
wanted to have a detailed list of what I

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
was didn't going to do so if I said I

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,590
was going to do a guessing game they

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,620
wanted me to put all of the steps in in

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,180
the guessing game that I would be doing

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,770
but the problem was in order to do that

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,240
I needed to know what all those steps

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,610
would be and that sort of meant I needed

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,380
to have the code effectively I needed to

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,169
have written written the project in

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:32,300
order to get that that table of contents

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:34,890
that level of detail and has partly

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,140
affected by the fact that I wanted to do

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:42,900
a tutorial driven book and so because

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,850
it's a tutorial each of the projects is

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,830
like a journey where you're you're going

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,240
down this journey and you're doing a

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:54,419
little different things along the road

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,620
and that means that you don't know what

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,870
you've covered until you've actually

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,570
covered it in terms of doing the

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,090
drafting so it turned out that the the

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,680
table of contents sort of the project

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,080
level table of contents was effectively

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,600
what we used and then the the more

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,449
detailed level of the sections had to be

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,909
filled in after the fact

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,110
so when I was planning the curriculum or

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,090
the the things that I was going to be

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,110
covering in the book these are the main

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,580
things that I was concerned with

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,939
learning objectives what exactly did I

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,169
want to cover and I was pretty I was

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:33,180
proud I shot pretty high in the learning

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,550
objectives and I had to wind it back

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,550
afterwards I also wanted to provide

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:42,089
motivations for the reader so I was

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,800
trying to find things to justify

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,589
everything that I did so I didn't want

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,240
any any element of the book to just fall

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:53,099
out of heaven and say look people do

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,430
this for no particular reason and I was

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:59,009
also driven by a couple of principles

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,719
which I will cover in a second so one of

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,789
the learn learning outcomes I want to

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:05,279
look for well basically I just wanted to

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:10,439
do everything and I tried my best to get

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:13,620
all of the key concepts into into the

00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,469
book now the trouble with getting all of

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,879
those key concepts into the book is that

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:21,740
for doing any one of those concepts you

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:28,979
have to do it really really slowly and

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:32,610
so what is where it ends up what it ends

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:34,289
up well what gives is the level of

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,020
exhaustive miss that you that I went to

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:41,550
in the details so if I came up and I

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,849
discussed a string object for example or

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,639
a list object I didn't go through and

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:50,069
list all of the methods that the lists

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,689
have I didn't go through everything that

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,110
you can do with a list I just said this

00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:58,080
is I put it in a context you need a list

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,060
to do this thing but then I didn't go

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,300
and tell them about everything else that

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,300
you could possibly do with a list

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,060
and that actually that approach actually

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,850
I felt helped because it meant that I

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,860
wasn't getting bogged down in detail

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,800
trying to explain every last detail

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,699
about things because I figured that

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,100
everyone would be bored out of their

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:29,400
brains if I did if I did that and the

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,440
other thing that gave was the book under

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,159
the weight of the work and there were

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,990
just too many pages and so some of the

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,180
projects are not in the book but they're

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:44,400
they're sort of extensions which will be

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:47,520
available online so motivations how did

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,960
I find the motivations that I was

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:55,560
looking for for for the content of the

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,310
of the of the book so the first thing

00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,620
that I was looking for was something

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,720
that was a practical application

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,850
I wanted something which had some

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,600
meaning and that's actually quite

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,160
difficult because the capability of

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,029
someone who's learning the projects is

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,820
quite limited and so the whole of you

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,050
know project two sorry you don't even

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,510
get started I didn't even start

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,640
programming into a project to is just

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,620
hello world and a couple of different

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,290
variations on hello world and put in a

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,120
loop and you know the sort of things

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,290
that I used to do you know when there

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:36,180
was a department store and you walked

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:37,830
past yeah at some time ago um I wanted

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,440
to have some what I've called anchor

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,850
motivations and they're like the goal at

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,020
the end of the tunnel the light at the

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,440
end of the tunnel something sort of

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,660
interesting you can do you can look

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,029
forward to and the first one was a

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,040
manipulator of minecraft on a Raspberry

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,400
Pi so there's a there's a library that

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,490
allows you to do allows you to

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,370
manipulate minecraft worlds using Python

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,540
and there were a couple of other things

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,620
doing some stuff with a chess engine

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,170
because I thought it'd be cool for them

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,990
to write their own chess game on top of

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,670
this thing called sunfish and I also

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,270
wanted to do some web scraping but in

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,149
the end they were just too much

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,779
so they were jettisoned but the

00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:22,490
Minecraft component was kept and so that

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,230
that anchor motivation is little local

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,240
that's where you what you will be able

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,450
to do at the end of the book and then

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,399
every every chapter every it's the the

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,040
project the book is broken into projects

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,620
and for each of the projects there is a

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,990
specific motivation and so there are not

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,730
necessarily very deep motivations but

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,950
there are things like doing a guessing

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,130
game converting that guessing game to

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:50,510
use to use a function so that's

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:52,580
reproducible doing an elite speaker so

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:58,940
changing some text into lead speak those

00:10:52,580 --> 00:11:02,480
sorts of very easy to achieve things and

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,339
in the in the course of doing that I was

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,260
trying to map those so I had my list of

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,330
things that I wanted to cover and then

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,279
as I covered them in a project I crossed

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,070
them off the list to try and get

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:16,010
everything done and of of all of those

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:19,040
things I found one thing was was

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,790
difficult to shoehorn and that was file

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,910
accessing so that that did end up going

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:29,029
into a project on there's a Caesar

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:33,170
cipher project in there and it went into

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:35,360
that Caesar cipher project so what were

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,630
the principles that I was acting on when

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,270
I was drafting the book number one was

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,800
learned by doing I mean to me that's got

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,370
to be the most important thing about

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,500
learning Python you're not going to

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,160
learn by reading you need to learn by

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,589
doing and given that I'm writing a book

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,180
and I'm not there with the person who's

00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,829
reading the book that was actually

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:04,839
really difficult but I tried my best to

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:09,940
inspire this learn by doing attitude and

00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:13,220
and partly in respect of that the first

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,310
two active projects projects two and

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,529
three are all on the interpreter the

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,600
command line the interpreter not on the

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,940
command line so I'm not even getting

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,130
into file you know saving things to a

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,040
file yet I'm just trying to get them to

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,440
realize that if they type into a

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,990
into the tech into the terminal they'll

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,710
get an instant response from Python and

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:39,380
on that the editor had to keep telling

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,140
me to explain to them what to do when I

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,720
like explaining in baby steps this is

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,670
actually what you type at the text type

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:53,630
this at the text when you see this type

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:55,490
this over and over and over again so to

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,500
demonstrate mistakes as normal and

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,330
that's part of that get in and do it

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,330
don't be worried about making mistakes

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,780
and also to make them use the

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,280
introspection features and that was also

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,930
partly linked back to the fact that I

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,910
wasn't covering everything in the book I

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,410
was only giving an access to well this

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,770
is what you absolutely need in order to

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:22,100
get to achieve this but if you use you

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,360
know if you used err on the on that

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,480
object you can find all these other

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,770
things that you can then investigate so

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,300
I wanted to provide understanding and

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,110
motivation and I've spoken a little bit

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,660
about motivation in the previous slides

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:42,890
but the thing that I wanted to say here

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,600
was that everything that I every I

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,030
didn't you I didn't want to introduce

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,940
any concept or any key word or anything

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,780
until I'd first explained it and also

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,950
given a reason why I was there and that

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,390
was really really difficult for the

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,210
first couple of projects because you're

00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,320
sort of bootstrapping yourself in those

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,390
first couple of projects but as you get

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,840
further into the book its it became

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:09,380
easier age appropriate vocabulary so a

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,260
lot of my words just got cut out I did

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,780
want to put in interesting words to

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,180
break the monotony of the coding section

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,990
but I tried to keep those in there in

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,150
sections where you didn't need to

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:27,070
understand the meaning of the word in

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,070
order to achieve something

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,690
and I also wanted to people I wanted to

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,190
I wanted the readers to understand that

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,130
there's a broader community out there

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,020
and so project one half of project one

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,350
was discussing you know you can go out

00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,780
to the internet and look for answers on

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,070
things you can go to the Python

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,500
documentation that's online you can use

00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:58,310
to help the help features within within

00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:00,770
Python practical decisions number one

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,840
was the most difficult and that is that

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:06,560
the books written targeting Python 2.7

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,540
and and partly the motivation there are

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,910
a lot of motivations for that the first

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,800
was my feeling was third-party libraries

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,970
out there were better had better support

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,920
for Python 2.7 than for Python 3 and in

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,190
particular the anchor project that I had

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,040
chosen which was the minecraft Pi thing

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,940
at the end needs Python 2.7 so in a

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,690
sense that was that was the main

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,940
influence on that but also Python 2.7 he

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,850
is installed by default on Macintosh

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,240
computers and so that also meant that

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:46,130
there was it was easier for those

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:49,310
children to access the the content it's

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:52,280
primarily command-line interface rather

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,200
than gooeys and that's because I just

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,190
thought it was too difficult to get onto

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,300
the gooey stuff like too many too many

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,570
supporting concepts were needed in order

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,340
to get to the gooeys

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,720
it's not overly game focused in the

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,720
sense that it's not focused on

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,880
two-dimensional three-dimensional games

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,160
there are I guess you would call them

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,210
command line games but they're not but

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,920
they're also not very deep in terms of

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,700
in terms of games like guessing like a

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,710
guessing game

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,750
he's the level of the game that's in

00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:31,250
there I wanted them to use the IDE to

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,310
get them introduced to the concept of an

00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,840
IDE but not the debugger component of it

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,000
apparently there are problems setting

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:44,959
breakpoints on max using

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,640
using that tikka in turn and not pygame

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,350
again because I thought pygame you

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,500
needed too much supporting

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,630
infrastructure in order to get there and

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,450
that TK into stuff is actually in the

00:16:53,630 --> 00:17:00,649
online projects the last couple of

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:03,709
projects so how do I go about writing it

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,939
well you're given a word template and

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,400
they talk and they tell you to draft

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,400
into it and they give you a whole heap

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,329
of styles they say this is our style and

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,640
we want you to apply it in these

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,770
situations when you have a piece of code

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,280
where you have 70 characters then you

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:22,579
apply the code eighty style to it if you

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,559
want normal text etc and so that was

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,240
done in that in the course of drafting

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,720
one of the difficult things was that

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,220
diagrams are not inlined into the and

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,670
they're not inlined into the document

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,840
and so the diagram has to be in a

00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,090
separate file and you have to reference

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,980
that file by its file number and if you

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,580
decide you want to change the file name

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,950
or you want to or reorganize the order

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,270
of the the screenshots the the diagrams

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,860
are you doing technically you're

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,970
supposed to redo the file names as well

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,800
which was really annoying actually

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,530
and I drafted and coded the stuff in

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,870
parallel so as something worked it got

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,740
him he introduced into the the text

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,790
publishers have this thing called art

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,919
which gets him included in the books

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,530
this is an example of art which is a

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,080
screenshot of the Python download page

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:18,919
the little lines coming out are called

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,220
call-outs and I've discovered that you

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:27,200
cannot do call-outs on text you can only

00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:28,700
do call-outs on images and so I had what

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,370
I wanted to do was do call-outs on

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,890
Python code but it was a problem because

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,380
they won't do call-outs on text so in in

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,470
the end I decided I didn't want to have

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,450
images of code like I wanted to have I

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,169
don't I don't know whether you

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,450
understand what I'm saying but I wanted

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,980
text they're not someone having taken a

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,800
photo of the text and then putting the

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,880
text putting that photo into the into

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:58,670
the body of the

00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:02,900
the document so art is anything other

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:05,300
than the text when they were when they

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,580
they gave me five actually seven pages

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,370
of instructions about how to take

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:14,090
screenshots one of which was that I

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,980
needed to use I have a screen resolution

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,820
not a known image resolution to screen

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,560
itself had to be 1024 by 768 which was

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,910
like you know there's a time and place

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:32,390
for 1024 by 768 and that time was the

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:35,150
1990s so what I ended up doing was I

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,730
wrote a program to sew on Windows you

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,620
can automate key presses and mouse

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,630
button mouse clicks and so forth and so

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:46,720
I just wrote a a program to automate the

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,490
typing of the code into a into a Python

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,650
command line and then taking of a screen

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,430
shot of it and doing the the fear

00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:59,750
captions the projects which involved art

00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,070
were much more time consuming art and

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,990
that means the screenshots of what's

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,940
going on much more time-consuming than

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:10,010
the ones which which didn't have any art

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:12,740
in them editing okay so this is what

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,530
happens after you've you know my

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,600
exquisite prose has gone off to the

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,850
editors and then at some time later they

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,070
come back with lots of red line through

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:26,750
it do this do that do something else

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,480
there are two editing stages with the to

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,560
editing stages in the book the first is

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,300
the technical editor that checks they

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,010
check the sense of the text but they

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,410
also check with a code whether the code

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,060
that's in their works and then there's

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:45,050
just the normal editor which checks the

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:47,440
english of the text but the the the

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,880
editor also made suggestions about the

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,890
sense that was being given by the text

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,450
the structure how whether lunch things

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,030
should whether wont concepts should come

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,620
before the other and in particular they

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,340
took the red line to a lot of my words

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,330
and put simpler words in so lots lots of

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,220
simple words

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,110
there was overlap between these two

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,850
editors in what they did like they often

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:13,490
both suggested things for readability

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,279
and but my ability to communicate with

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,100
the technical editor was quite limited

00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:21,440
and so I had to get used to that there

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,539
was a little bit difficult so the coding

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,669
was all done on Linux but tested on

00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,820
Windows and Macintosh

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:32,600
I used subversion to keep track of

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,669
versions and I synced it to the text by

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,730
just putting in an author's note into

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,529
the body of the text but the thing that

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,880
I had to remember and that I needed that

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:43,220
you probably ain't remember if you're

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,820
going to do this is that the master is

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,210
what's in the document not what's he in

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,620
the subversion repository because when

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,600
people are reading the books they're not

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,159
going to the repository they're going to

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,710
the text which is in front of them in

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,830
the book and so all of the code testing

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:07,179
involves just cutting and pasting from

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:09,320
the document back into a command line

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,230
and because there was a it was a

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,779
tutorial style to the project any

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,510
changes to the code were much more

00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,059
difficult because you know you have a

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,350
stream where the code starts here and

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,210
then it ends here and it changes along

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,159
the way if you make a change here then

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,090
you've got to check everything else all

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,090
of the other versions

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,170
proofing they provide they send me from

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,070
some PDFs I print them out and I

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:40,710
scribble all over them code colors are

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,820
our code colors let's talk about

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:47,520
tribulations okay so I was in there

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:51,540
working my little backside off drafting

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,740
these things and all of a sudden they

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,170
were telling me that I would had too

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,910
many pages I thought I was just on track

00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,300
but I was actually had too many pages

00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:03,600
they cut back take things out they said

00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:06,600
throw away that project that you've

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,330
almost finished writing on the Sun Sun

00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,740
fish chess engine and it turned out what

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,360
happened was that they'd changed the way

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,280
they wanted to present the book and that

00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,710
had meant that there was a different

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,350
allocation of white space to the page

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,990
and that meant that each page which I

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:27,830
wrote as a page before was now about one

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:30,360
and a third pages and so I had this

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:35,120
additional problem of actually spending

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:37,530
effort removing stuff that I had put in

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,630
code eighty means 80 characters right

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,910
well that's what it said in the docs

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:46,950
that they gave me it turned out that

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,780
Cody was only 69 characters and so that

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,020
meant and I discovered that only at the

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,840
proofing stage so all of the coding was

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,030
done and I had sort of avoided doing

00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,750
code continuation characters and all of

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,030
that and so I had to go back and find

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,610
all of those lines which were over 69

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,290
characters and most of the time I tried

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,630
to restructure the code so that was less

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,490
than six nine characters but in a couple

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,110
I I actually needed to do the code

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,760
continuation characters and that meant

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,930
that I had to add extra paragraphs

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,840
explaining what these new slashes are at

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:25,590
the end of the some of the some of the

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:27,180
some of the lines syntax highlighting me

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,310
in the copy text I discovered this was a

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,050
possibility I just thought that would be

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,420
great if you can have syntax

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:36,330
highlighting in the body of the the text

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,190
that they're reading in the book but

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,240
apparently it was really difficult for

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,960
them

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,670
for me I can you know put just color the

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,170
font and it's you know it's fine can't

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,630
you just print it out with the colored

00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,410
font no apparently it's very difficult

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:55,620
for some reason has to be done manually

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,630
and so all of the syntax highlighting I

00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,200
have to I had to check manually when it

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,410
came back improve proofing that came as

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,580
a big surprise to me a couple of other

00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,950
tribulations which are not that

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:13,290
important so throughout the book I

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:16,560
trying to I'm trying to link back to the

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:19,020
to the Monty Python basis of Python you

00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,690
know that's how it was named and so I've

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,600
put little little asides in there

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,360
explaining some some things which happen

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,190
in you know these are the they do that

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:36,540
some of their movies are the life of

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:37,920
Brian and meaning of life and mana thank

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,920
you

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,750
and the comment comes back to me from

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,950
the editor or by the way the life of

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,180
brian has rated our in the US so we have

00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,640
to cut that out

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,640
so there's no reference to the life of

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,760
brian in the book and the other thing

00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:01,220
was i tried to include things like zama

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:03,290
god in there but because that has a

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,330
because that has a religious connotation

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,010
it was considered to be not politically

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:15,570
correct and so those sorts of references

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:18,090
were also taken out so i had i had a

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,160
really good time writing the book he

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,910
took a lot longer than i expected it to

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,260
and it's it's still not finished in

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,500
particular i have to go and do some

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,630
review of the online chapters but the

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,970
online chapters i've got more time to do

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,430
because I have to get printed and the

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,950
time commitment well as I said was a lot

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,670
longer than I expected it to be both in

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,350
terms of my actual time that I had to do

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,240
but also when it was going to be

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,190
finished so I expected to be finished in

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:52,290
in February and it's still going

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:55,050
and there were issues with the format in

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,490
which I was unable to control and which

00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:00,330
caused me that's part of the reason why

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:04,170
I'm the time commitment was was so was

00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,730
so much so if you're thinking about

00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,040
doing anything along these lines I hope

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,070
that that's provided you with some help

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,780
and if not if you don't feel like doing

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,360
that go and check the book out when it

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:19,460
gets published and let me know any

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,460
feedback you have thank you very much

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:37,970
any questions anybody thinking of

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:37,970
writing a book it's quite interesting

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:51,930
I have you tested your Python for kids

00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:57,030
on any actual kids yet yes yes well and

00:27:51,930 --> 00:28:01,110
part of I mean so so the book is

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:05,370
inspired by a blog and while nothing was

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:07,590
copied from the blog it was all you know

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:11,210
it's follows the same similar sort of

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:15,630
structure the technical editor as well

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:18,570
tried them out tried part of what her

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,480
one of her day jobs use as a classroom

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:25,190
teacher and so she was also trying it

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,190
out on the kids

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,600
one question for me how could you say a

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,620
bit more about the origins at the blog

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,500
itself oh well yeah my son who's hiding

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:42,760
up the back I thought I would like him

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:46,030
to learn how to to code in Python and so

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:50,650
I just started putting comments on I

00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:51,910
started a blog asked him to do the

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,620
exercises that I was putting on the blog

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,250
you can go and check it out and you can

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,200
see the first you know the first blog

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:03,220
entry is just you know it's just like

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,530
range 10 something right it's and and

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:10,150
the point of it all is just one step at

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:15,340
a time not don't but I don't want to

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:18,490
overwhelm them with details but also if

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:21,070
you check the blog sometimes I just have

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,140
a chat about something that's different

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:30,850
and it might be relevant to their lives

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:32,710
and so I didn't want the book and I

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,679
don't want coding to be something which

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:39,940
is separate from your existence your

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,160
reality so anyway the blog has been

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:48,990
going for about five years it's it gets

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:48,990
about a thousand unique visits a week

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,549
and I haven't actually updated for a

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,049
year who now also know but I'll be

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,169
starting to do that in the next couple

00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:57,169
of weeks

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,970
so I'm interested because I know you

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,889
from your legal work which is very

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:13,580
different to this how did you fit in

00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:18,320
you're extremely busy day job with visas

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:23,649
for help well it's I had a I had a I had

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,649
a so if I can go back here

00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:28,460
do-do-do-do-do-do-do this section

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:31,730
December to January or December to

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,070
February that was my time off that was

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,940
just I got some time I want to make some

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:40,580
use of it and the difficult thing was

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:43,159
aligning the stars so that they gave me

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:48,950
the go-ahead in order to make use of

00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:50,960
that time and actually the truth the

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,149
truth is I started writing in December

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,879
and I assumed that if I couldn't pull

00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:58,399
the contract off then I would just go

00:30:55,879 --> 00:31:00,289
and self publish it because I had a

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,090
window of opportunity from January to

00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:06,519
February but that period from February

00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,519
to now has been quite challenging

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,910
and just on that it's quite challenging

00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:18,070
because this these this review and

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,960
editing beard

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,300
he's actually quite a big time

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,130
commitment you know it's probably twenty

00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,870
thirty percent of the original drafting

00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:31,660
time so what was the motivation for the

00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:34,390
anchor project Museum on craft by what

00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,400
was them but I'm so motivation for using

00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:40,870
minecraft's pyres you anchor project

00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,330
well because because it's a bit

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:47,590
different it involves them using a piece

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:50,200
of hardware which is a little bit it's

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:54,190
it's sort of out there a little bit but

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:58,900
it's entirely within their capacity then

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:02,800
or their parents to a by and and be put

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:06,490
together and once you've done that it

00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:11,260
comes minecraft is already there and the

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:15,610
minecraft PI library is also already

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:21,040
there and so it just seemed like a fun

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:23,530
little thing that they could do and so

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,770
what the idea is that they can build a

00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,450
castle and so they can change you know

00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,230
the size and shape of the castle if they

00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,180
want to but it also allows them to you

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,920
know just wipe out a whole and into it

00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,240
so part of building the Carson's you got

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,890
to clear some ground and so they can

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,210
wipe out a whole area I mean the main

00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:48,970
the main motivation is minecraft is has

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:54,000
so much mindshare there has a lot of

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:56,860
mindshare with that level of of child

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,980
and it's and if they can do it then

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,530
they're empowered to do something within

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,120
that minecraft environment which i think

00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,950
you know it's something they can brag to

00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,490
their friends about pretty pretty

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,779
easily so that's sort of you know that's

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,850
the threads of the motivations that were

00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,940
going through my my mind I mean on the

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,649
on the on the negative side it broke one

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,960
principle which was that I wanted

00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:24,179
everything to be simple and the proof

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,409
because setting up a Raspberry Pi is not

00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:28,149
simple and it is something that they're

00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:31,179
probably gonna need to have a

00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:32,919
responsible adult to do but once it's up

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,669
and running to everything else they

00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,669
should be able to do

00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,940
Thank You Brendan thank you

00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,760
