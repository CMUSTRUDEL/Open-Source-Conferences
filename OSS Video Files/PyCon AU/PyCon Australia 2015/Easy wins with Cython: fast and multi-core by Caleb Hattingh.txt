Title: Easy wins with Cython: fast and multi-core by Caleb Hattingh
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	Python has often been criticised for slow runtime performance, and for the GIL which prevents multi-core concurrency. Cython provides tools for addressing both issues, and in a way that is simple enough for the average programmer to use.

This talk will show:

- How to get started with Cython
- Tools to make day-to-day Cython work easier
- How to dramatically speed up a slow function
- How to distribute work over multiple CPU cores

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
