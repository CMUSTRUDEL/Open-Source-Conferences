Description: 
	What do sprinters eat before a race?
Nothing, they fast.

Sprinting at PyCon AU is not like that at all. Instead, it's a great chance to do something good for the community and get to know some fellow devs along the way. The sprints are an semi-formal two-day event following the close of the main track of the conference where people get together and code on whatever takes their fancy. Most of the time, it's a a chance to work on an open source package you're already involved with in some way, or to meet face-to-face with people you otherwise know only by email.

However, there are also those brave souls who are joining in for the first time. It can be particularly intimidating if you don't know the others there or how to really get started. This presentation will talk about the sprint format, how to get in with a sprint group, and how to be productive in such a short time (especially if you're new to the concept).

We'll cover off basics like getting your environment set up, checking out the code, and identifying appropriate projects and tasks to work on. Standard workflows and tips on how and when to approach people for assistance can also help to make things flow more smoothly.

It will also include some tips for sprint leaders about how to make your project easy and enjoyable for others to hack on. There is a lot than can be done without a lot of effort, such as pre-classifying bugs or identifying appropriate tasks for newcomers, identifying "go-to" people in your project, and spending time on the day talking to people and getting them comfortable working on your code. Clearly documenting simple workflows (like how to submit a patch, what code standards are used, and how to validate results) can help tremendously.

With any luck, this presentation can help both sprint leaders and attendees with a smoother experience which gets the difficulties out the way and leaves maximum opportunity for coding and enjoyment.

Tennessee has gone through the meatgrinder of sprinting, from sitting down with a group of strangers trying to help them fix trivial bugs, to developing significant extensions, to leading sprints. With the scars to show and lessons learned, he is in a reasonable position to help suggest some simple things that can make sprinting easier and more enjoyable for the newcomer.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,830
Chris yeah come I was going you know

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,150
going back a couple of months and it was

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,920
time to you know submit our

00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,240
presentations for pike on a you and I

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,130
talked to a few people about you know

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,020
maybe what I could do they said I should

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,970
should do a presentation on sprinting

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,259
thought well it's a bit weird but you

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,410
know look all right we'll see if it gets

00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:31,090
up so I looked at some of the prior

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,800
presentations that have been given it at

00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,989
PyCon a you and I discovered there were

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,030
a lot of cats so I thought okay right

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,310
cats and sprinting and you know I ran

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,110
this past a few people and they were you

00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,789
know pretty right with it so I thought

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,680
well okay so people are going to want to

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,969
know how to sprint you know one of the

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,140
first things you want to know if you

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,850
want to be introduced to sprinting is

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,039
how to do it so I thought we better talk

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,719
to you about the equipment and then at

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,160
this point they said hang on I think I

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,100
think you've got it wrong I think you

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,510
don't need need shoes to sprint I think

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,210
what you really need is a computer if

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,530
you want to sprint so I thought well you

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,360
know this one appears to be you know

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,250
reasonably reasonably portable but then

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,560
then I realized I had the wrong idea

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,380
entirely and I went and looked up what

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,909
they were really talking about so you

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,410
know let's let's look at what sprinting

00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,000
is in this context it turns out that

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,790
it's actually writing code and

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
documentation and tests and contributing

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,750
to open source and solving problems and

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,580
all sorts of things that I I enjoy doing

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,740
with my spare time so I'm like oh this

00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,140
is brilliant I didn't realize that there

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,930
was such such a form of sprinting now

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,670
I'm sure that all of you are well ahead

00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,850
of me and in understanding what that

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,040
what this concept is but many people may

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,690
be pondering whether that whether that

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,370
would like to consider sprinting in

00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,470
future either at this conference or in

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,960
future conferences and people who are

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,790
running sprints may benefit from some

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,250
kind of basic guidelines on just how to

00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,350
smooth the process out a little bit and

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,600
people who are actually here to take

00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,550
part for the first time could benefit

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,650
from just a little bit of a road map so

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,060
let's have a look at what's prints look

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,220
like so that you know what you're in for

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,930
well this is the fast track so them to

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,760
terrifying you sit around there are

00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,220
tables and collaborative workspaces and

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,250
you have the opportunity to talk with

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,349
people as much as you like or there's

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,090
also the slow track you can just sit

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,920
around be sent bit be a bit more

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,320
independent and take a more casual

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,360
approach to the next couple of days so

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,290
it's a very safe working environment

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,870
it's more in

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,659
formal there's a little less hierarchy

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,250
going on but you do your own work as a

00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,879
part of a group on an open source

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,650
project so how do you start so the

00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,599
starting line is that well you want to

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,280
join a sprint is typically what you

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,510
would do some people will will lead a

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,450
sprint and they will be there and

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,519
indicate that they're available to coach

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,370
you for us a sprint and be able to give

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,750
you some directions so you can you can

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,489
do that in a number of different ways

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,560
you can there's usually a whiteboard or

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,510
other other board in the room that you

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,879
can you can put up their emails in

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,639
advance are very helpful labeling your

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,109
table is clearly welcoming of new

00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,489
members so that they know that they can

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,280
come up and what project you're working

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,959
on can be very helpful and adding your

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,120
project to the wiki is something that

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,189
you might like to consider doing now

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,739
also more than welcome to do individual

00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,450
work and either collaborate on an open

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,400
source project are yourself with

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,919
international partners just work on a

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,109
personal project it's a very relaxed

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,389
approach there are some useful things to

00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:27,819
know you should know where the sprint

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,319
venue is I don't know where the sprint

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,470
venue is Chris where is the sprint

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:36,400
Fenian right behind me so the sprint

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,220
venue is just here and it's going to be

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,409
very small so a long line I think will

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,879
be the appropriate in the ballroom okay

00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,290
there you go yes you see why I took me

00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,349
awhile to bring this this presentation

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,540
together ok so we've identified the

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,299
venue you need to know how to use Forks

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,579
and branches that that's generally very

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,989
helpful one of the fundamental mechanism

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,680
if you want to make a change I will

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,879
generally recommend beginning with

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,790
creating a new branch for your work

00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,519
that's a good tip some knowledge of

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,169
automated testing is beneficial you may

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
find the project you're collaborating on

00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,310
lacks that knowledge in which case you

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,659
can helpfully bring it to that team but

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,699
it's something that I would recommend

00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,259
getting a bit of a start you know do a

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,789
bit of searching ahead of time see how

00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:27,009
you could use it yourself github is the

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:30,699
tool d'azur to the extent that it is

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,930
more or less ubiquitous so that means

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,570
that probably you're already familiar

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,159
with it but also you're definitely going

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,129
to have to contend with it and the other

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,610
great advantage

00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,599
is knowing when to take a break as well

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,239
there are some people that you might

00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,639
meet you might might fit in with an

00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:48,949
experienced team you might find a

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,339
growing community of people it's a very

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,929
social activity if you can find someone

00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:56,149
on an experienced team who's happy to

00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:59,029
function as a coach I propose that you

00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:01,189
latch on to them don't let them go and

00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,839
generally generally just a hover in

00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:05,479
their general surroundings because they

00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,129
will lift you up to the next level there

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,659
may be some newbies you should be be

00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,899
helpful to these people because they

00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:15,199
always form your next round of minions I

00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:17,119
mean community members and that there

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,800
are some leaders solely a leader to me

00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:20,779
is separate from a coach where a coach

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,539
will have like particular skills around

00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,969
helping the contributors maximize that

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,979
their experience and contribute and be a

00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,629
part of the community the leader may be

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,219
the person with the technical vision and

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,379
they're not always going to be the same

00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:35,029
person although often they are you might

00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,129
find the odd guru who is neither a

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:40,339
terribly effective leader nor coach but

00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:42,740
knows all of the things so approach them

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:45,679
with an appropriate amount of care

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:49,009
respect and self preservation but i

00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,539
encourage you to to get into it and you

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,219
may find a few people who are simply

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,379
unattached wandering lost through the

00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:56,360
Sprint's wondering what to do project

00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,099
leaders this is your opportunity you

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,169
should find them and Hoover them up and

00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:03,439
the faster you are that the better your

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:05,300
project will go so how do you run a

00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,039
sprint well there are a few different

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,749
ways to run a sprint you've got to take

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,519
a look at your goals I've run one sprint

00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:15,289
but that sprint went really well and

00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,569
there were a few specific things that I

00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,339
did that made it go a lot better one is

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,289
is that I made it really clear that

00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,089
people were welcome to arrive and join

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,789
the table at any time during the

00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,709
Sprint's so that assisted greatly

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,990
because people who came in after a break

00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,729
or came in from another project clearly

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,439
knew that they were welcome to sit down

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,899
and would be supported into joining the

00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,729
team so there was that that was

00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,529
addressing the kind of the leaky

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,449
pipeline of people whether they want to

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,309
move from one sprint for another or come

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:44,509
in or not should think about what your

00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,939
goals are do you have a specific

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,129
technical goal in mind you want to get X

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,960
done or you mainly focused on building

00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,940
your community the

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,889
or do you even just do have an itch to

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,050
scratch do you need to sell other people

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,340
on the benefits of your work do you need

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,289
to come up with some kind of

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,880
architectural plan to explain clearly

00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,800
what people are going to attempt to

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,150
achieve what do you mostly just want to

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,370
concentrate on building a human

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,169
connection with someone get to know

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,550
someone personally who maybe you work

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,370
with already but is from a different

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,580
state or a different location providing

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,610
clear instructions by clear instructions

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,160
i don't mean restrictive conditions I

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,810
mean things like these are the tools

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,300
you're going to be working with these

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,310
are the set of URLs to the get lab and

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,780
the Travis CI and all of that and the

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,210
documentation and the things that you're

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,620
going to be work with working with you

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,419
don't necessarily have to do that in

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,979
advance but having something so that you

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,169
don't have to repeat that excessively

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,449
and assist Willis will help you save

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,220
time also assess people who need to look

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,909
things up from reference a little down

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,919
the down the track decide your role are

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,830
you going to be the coach the developer

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,630
a leader appear a hacker if you wonder

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,979
if you want to be a part of a sprint in

00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,680
you have a project but you're not really

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:00,740
so confident on whether you can function

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,970
in a strong leadership capacity but

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,220
you'd still like to work with other

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,780
people well that's completely fine all

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,310
you need to do is explain to the other

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,770
people hey I've got this problem that

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,020
I'm working on I don't necessarily have

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,430
the perfect way forward identified but

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,900
why don't you come and help me you know

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,909
we'll put our minds together and see if

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,370
we can crack this one together there's

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,490
no expectation that if you are running a

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,110
sprint that you must be responsible for

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,050
its success and there's no expectation

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,560
that if you're contributing to an extent

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,180
that you shouldn't have an equal voice

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,500
on the team you know commensurate with

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,979
what you've got to add to the

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,289
conversation I would recommend taking

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,959
charge of inductions and introductions

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,899
as a sprint leader introduce the people

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,640
on your table to each other so that they

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,930
know each other's names potentially know

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,149
the roles that they're going to take

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,970
within within your sprint if you can

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,620
identify projects or useful useful tasks

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,170
for new developers that can be very

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,810
helpful bug report addressing specific

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,940
bug reports or documentation tasks

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,100
having a decent queue of these even if

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,899
you already know how to solve them the

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,519
main goal

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,869
be assisting someone else in learning

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,059
how to solve them and then that person

00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:12,730
will be more effective in contributing

00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:14,470
back to your community and future you

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,079
don't have to take that approach another

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,420
approach is to say we are going to get

00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,639
three people who know how to get the job

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,889
done to work as a specific team on a

00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,920
specific task that is also completely

00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,439
fine it's just a matter matter of taste

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,779
and preference really I would suggest to

00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:35,199
use some tools to assist with the

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:38,110
process github obviously three other

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,910
tools that people may not all use even

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,660
though many will be familiar with is

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,660
Trello Travis and lumio Travis is a good

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,369
work up to Trillo mashing them together

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,470
there Trillo is a really good workflow

00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:52,449
tool it's very simple to use it's really

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,879
easy to invite people to and sign up and

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:56,800
you can create task cards that you can

00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,199
you can move around and assign people to

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,899
it's a reasonably good way of tracking

00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,279
the activity of up to say you know five

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,139
or ten people in terms of identifying

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,600
their priorities and you can throw it

00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,639
together in five minutes and then that

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,290
can help reduce collisions or the risk

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,610
of people working in two similar areas

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,679
Travis is an automated test and

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,990
integration tool that will suck down

00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:23,199
your github open source code and run it

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,319
in a virtual environment for you on the

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:29,709
internet so that will also track things

00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:32,470
like merge requests on github and branch

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,699
commits and and fort commits so it's

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,009
something you can use as a project

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,899
leader to identify someone working on a

00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,910
branch but struggling and committing

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,319
breaking code you can identify that

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,480
before they're trying to get it back

00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:44,860
onto your repository it also gives you a

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,230
good picture of what the people and

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,990
you're on your project might be doing as

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,360
an individual developer you can set that

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,639
up on a fork of a main project you don't

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,279
need anyone's permission or privileges

00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,499
you can you can add add the little you

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,629
know Travis config file and set that up

00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:03,399
pretty straightforwardly it's something

00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,379
i did on a project recently where i'm

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,360
contributing unit tests i don't actually

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,639
know how to do what they do but i know

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,619
how to go from no unit tests to some

00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,839
unit tests and i've been helping them

00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:15,699
and i put travis on my fork because they

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,040
weren't ready to to go through a

00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,920
continuous integration path but i was

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,410
able to use it

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,630
to track and guarantee the the level of

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,120
compliance and when I pull things down

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,709
from there the upstream branch I'm also

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,180
able to pick up any issues that have

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,519
been introduced by their commits and

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,529
send weaselly little emails back to the

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,019
package maintainer who appears to be

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,370
have a very thick skin ignore completely

00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,320
the fact they haven't set it up and

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,399
kindly just fixes them in two seconds

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,470
because they're a goo I would look

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,970
considering lumio maybe something for

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,250
larger projects or things that actually

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,769
do have a better decision making to be

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,510
made essentially you create a lumio

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,639
issue for any kind of decision or

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,230
discussion that needs to be had allows

00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,060
you know voting and discussing and

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,139
discussion and recording of outcomes and

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,810
that can be another reasonable

00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:06,260
collaborative tool and document your

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,329
progress be inspirational if you if you

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,630
want to gain gain a little bit of air

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:13,639
time and a little bit of visibility

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,550
publishing a blog saying we conducted a

00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,560
sprint at PyCon a you ver a certain a

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,750
certain number of attendees we were able

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,910
to assist with a certain number of tasks

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,680
can help give your project a bit of

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,050
visibility gives Pike wanna use some

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,459
visibility and documents the work that

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,490
was done and I think that would be a

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,589
good bit of social glue as well so

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,300
you'll all be pleased to know this is a

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,120
very short presentation because there's

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:41,570
not a lot more to it than that I'm going

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,130
to spend a little bit of time now just

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,279
may be introducing some of the Sprint's

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:51,490
that might come up only actually know of

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:55,670
one so I will do that right exactly

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,860
indeed yes so if those people who are

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,420
comfortable to announce their sprints

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,339
could come up to this microphone that

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,680
would be wonderful the one that I know

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,920
of who's who a head of time was able to

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,319
provide me with the slide gets to have

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,060
all of the visual space so I might put

00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:13,100
rustle up first so that he can talk to

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,260
his slide and then i'll so i'll hand

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,029
over now to those people and then once

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,279
that's finished we'll go through any dis

00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:24,920
audience discussions so far away Russell

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,329
oh okay so um hi I'm Russell you may

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,360
have seen me a couple of times you may

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:31,120
have see me here a couple of times so I

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,279
will be obviously sprinting on django

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,300
django was

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,569
one of the things always printing on

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,300
that means trying out new patches trying

00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:41,399
out new bugs testing new features trying

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,079
to find bugs new features even things as

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,810
simple as if you have a work project

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,180
where you are using Django try upgrading

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,339
to trunk Django and see what breaks

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,499
that's incredibly useful information for

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,970
us so anyway if that my personal goal

00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,610
would I set up there on the slide that I

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,809
sent sent 10 is that my my personal

00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,910
Garlits prince is to get absolutely

00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,050
nothing done myself my goal is to help

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,149
everyone else and make them as

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,249
productive as possible it is an entirely

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,050
achievable goal for anyone who attends a

00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,059
sprint and when when it's in the django

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,709
sprint anyway to be a kabhi in the

00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,509
commuters file by the end of the sprint

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,860
or very soon after with once once the

00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,110
patches had a chance to be reviewed it's

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,399
entirely achievable so you know if

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,100
you're interested in working on django

00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,839
either to contribute to django or we

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,309
also have a number of community projects

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,470
around the outside of that so people

00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,990
whether sites we need people to build or

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,180
additions to add to Django's own website

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,910
that we need people to build so i'm also

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,680
we're going to be sprinting on all sorts

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,699
of toga and place than Python mobile

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,500
related stuff so if you want to see

00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:39,779
being about those I'm also be sprinting

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,839
and I I need minions I did many minions

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:46,800
I need millions of minions so there's a

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:50,579
million yeah the minion marketplace is

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,399
heating up okay so i'm robert collins

00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,050
and i echo everything russell said about

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,389
this the way to approach this print the

00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,819
projects i'm going to be helping folk

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:02,339
contrary to is going to be Python itself

00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:06,120
and there's a bunch of unit test stuff

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,670
that needs some extra love OpenStack is

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,350
a project a few people have heard of and

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,300
there's a whole bunch of folk here who

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,529
no offense taken will be either doing

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,439
their own things we're helping people do

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:18,029
things on them and obviously pip which

00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,129
I've done two talks about this weekend

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,110
because it's a very target rich

00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:24,209
environment and anyone who wants to get

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,829
involved I will happily help you become

00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:33,029
a committer hello a minute hello my name

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:36,240
is tyson i attended the Django core team

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,069
impromptu talk on Friday and we

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,689
discussed something called Jango stables

00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,689
which is essentially the idea to bring

00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,399
testing to the massive Django projects

00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,900
that are out there and formalize the

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,060
process so that when

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,760
a new thing gets rolled into Jengo trunk

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,170
that your project can be tested against

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,220
that and that Django core devs have

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,670
essentially a dashboard that they can

00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,960
see I'll hang on we just went and broke

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:04,680
Django rest framework with this patch

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,510
and that then is part of the cycle but

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,310
it means that your projects can be

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,930
first-class citizens on that testing

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,630
framework to you go and put your own

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,460
tests in and such and all of a sudden

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,600
you know the core team will start sort

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,130
of knocking on your door at some point

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,810
saying hey we notice that this broke

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:26,910
your system and yeah we're on it come

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:29,460
and see me I was intending on doing that

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,320
actually um hello my name is Josh for

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,340
those who don't know me I got a number

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,170
different projects gonna be working on

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,540
three month at use that I'd love some

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,040
help with people are keen for example

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,780
I'll be working on OpenStack and happy

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,850
to help people get started with their

00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,070
first patch they're interested as well

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,870
as the zoo gating system which I gave a

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,520
talk about yesterday I'm also doing a

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,400
bunch of Linux Australian things and

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,070
we're going to possibly burn or try and

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,410
fix zookeeper a little bit which run to

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,030
this conference along with our

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,250
membership database hopefully we get

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,840
some few people to help work on that and

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,820
also the organization has a lot of other

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,750
tasks to the unnecessary code related so

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,520
if you think that you would be

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,980
interested in helping rights and

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,040
documentation or updating our website or

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,300
working on our membership mailing lists

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,850
or things like that would love some help

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,100
and input please find me happy to get to

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:24,720
know you love your help hi i am tim from

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:27,510
the two mini projects i'd obviously love

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,600
help with any of those projects but one

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,630
thing i wanted to specific highlight is

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,540
i'll be working on a bunch of hardware

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,940
stuff tomorrow so if you want to play

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,150
with things that have you know physical

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,640
blinking lights i'll probably have six

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,540
or seven different development boards

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,970
there tomorrow and we can actually do

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:55,380
some cool stuff that has real-world

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,870
interfaces so if you're interested in

00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,059
playing with hardware

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,720
and interested in learning how to use

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:05,960
Python for doing hardware stuff and want

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,610
to help contribute I absolutely love to

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,950
have your help on that okay thanks

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:16,220
everyone I'll just add two final remarks

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,570
before questions one is is that my view

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,840
of the sprints and the reason that I

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,270
attend each year is because working with

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,640
the kind of people who tend to lead

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,820
sprints at PyCon au represents a

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,220
training opportunity second to none to

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,830
learn the way that other people develop

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,840
and from from some of the Masters so I

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,790
think it can be easily sold to

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,070
workplaces should that be a factor for

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,290
you in terms of obtaining some funding

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,990
going on a two-day training course will

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,720
cost you a lot more than attending two

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,230
days of sprints at five bucks a day I

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,630
myself am not particularly planning to

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,640
lead a sprint so I'm in the unattached

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:02,540
category at the moment but if there is a

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,970
reasonable cohort of new new developers

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,860
of the day on the day where you find

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,170
that maybe those projects or outline

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,910
feel like you feel like the learning

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,950
curves too steep or for some other

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,890
reason just aren't for you I have no

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,050
shortage of Mad Science plans that I can

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,790
turn into activities and I'll be more

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,290
than happy to run in that direction if

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,050
that's something that's called for on

00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:29,090
the day but that's enough about me any

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:30,710
more questions from audience I don't

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,570
have a question but if Nick Coughlin

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,070
could like get on deck on that lectern

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,750
that would be fantastic that'll get the

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,700
lightning talks started really quickly

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,590
once this finishes but questions over to

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,590
this stand here if you've got me all

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,460
right doesn't sound like it all right

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,460
thank you everybody

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,660
you

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,820
