Title: Ansible, Simplicity, and the Zen of Python by Todd Owen
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python, that has taken the world of IT automation by storm. Its most remarkable quality is simplicity.

The Zen of Python is a set of aphorisms which capture the design philosophy of the Python language, one being "Simple is better than complex".

In this talk, weâ€™ll look at some of the concrete ways that Ansible embodies the Zen of Python, in an attempt to unravel the true meaning of the sometimes cryptic aphorisms. Along the way we will consider why simplicity is a such good thing, yet tantalisingly out of reach in most software projects.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
