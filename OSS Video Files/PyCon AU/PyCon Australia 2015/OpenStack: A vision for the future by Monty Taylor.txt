Title: OpenStack: A vision for the future by Monty Taylor
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	OpenStack as a phenomenon has been explosive and rather unprecedented. The highly decentralized decision making coupled with an aggressive release cadence have allowed us to be both an inclusive body and also ship software. However, crisp vision is not necessarily an emergent property of collective thought process. It's time for some vision to be presented and championed if we're going to take the next step in our evolution.

Let's talk about a vision of what OpenStack needs to be, how it needs to be shaped, and what it will take to get us there.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,110
so

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,720
um I am going to chat with you a little

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,980
bit about about OpenStack the title of

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,060
this is OpenStack a vision for the

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,880
future it there's a lie on this slide

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,580
which it there's a link to where where

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,080
these slides are online I haven't had

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,050
the internet in a while because my

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,610
flight from the u.s. to Australia didn't

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,699
have a Wi-Fi on it which is very

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,920
terrible so I was not able I haven't

00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:43,559
pushed the slides up to the online yet

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,970
so once this is over I'll go over and

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,610
I'll type git push and things will

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,299
publish and it'll be great and you can

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,030
also clone them from get in August calm

00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:57,239
more Mordred talks if you really wanted

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,979
to fork these slides and go do something

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,989
with them yourself they are creative

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,150
commons licensed I have literally no

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,519
idea what benefit that would be to you

00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,860
but that doesn't matter whether you know

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,020
that or not so go nuts feel free to

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,409
tweet about the things that are going to

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,670
talk about which ostensibly are supposed

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,250
to be about OpenStack but actually

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,840
there's this fellow named Stanislavski

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,109
that I've decided is going to make a

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,689
really great subject for conversation

00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:26,340
it's possible you you might have come

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,950
into your since this is the OpenStack

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,450
mini-con fit pike on a you thinking that

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,810
this is going to have potentially lots

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,890
of deep technical content about open sac

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,439
which is open source cloud software

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,369
written in Python in case you were not

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,810
aware of that but that's no I do that a

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,200
lot so I thought we'd I thought we mix

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,340
it up a little bit and instead instead

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,789
talk metaphorically a little bit I

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,499
anyway we'll get there so um

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,909
traditionally I would I put a slide like

00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:59,460
this at the top of a lot of the talks

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,710
that I give to people and in it it sort

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,909
of describes that you know I I do the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,140
things that Robert mentioned I'm on the

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,640
technical committee and the board of

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,550
directors for the OpenStack foundation

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,110
and I also AM a core team member on the

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,210
OpenStack developer infrastructure team

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,819
and we do all of those sorts of things

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,410
and this is the this next slide is we're

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,980
going to see if I can do blind HTML

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,690
editing aha look at that so what I leave

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,770
off of it a lot of times is that I

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,600
haven't I have my degree is in theater

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,460
I have an undergraduate degree in

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,890
theatre directing I also went to grad

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,990
school at calarts and California for a

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,140
while to do lighting design and I'm a

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:38,180
currently a company member of a theater

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,760
collective in Seattle even though I live

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,190
in New York called the story group so

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,440
these things usually aren't particularly

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,450
relevant to the topic at hand so I don't

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,190
normally put them on onto a onto a slide

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,650
but uh but I think for this one it might

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,240
be worthwhile pointing that out because

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,220
I'm sure in a couple slides you're going

00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,170
to be wondering why the heck I'm talking

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,720
about what I'm talking about I promise

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,520
it'll probably go somewhere but just

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,510
bear with me for a little bit so so

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,190
there's this guy named named

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,220
Stanislavski his name is actually longer

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,230
than that because he's Russian and and

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,220
Russians like to have long multiple name

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,170
names as best I can tell I'm I believe

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,320
that the the Cyrillic characters

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,180
underneath it actually also um say the

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,830
same thing but since I don't actually

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,010
read Cyrillic then I can't really bout

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,070
true that so he's the founder of the

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,959
moscow art theatre which if you've never

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,010
heard of it you should you should you

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,290
should check them out at some point in

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,220
time there they're kind of a kind of a

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,910
thing we'll talk about that a little

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,910
more in a second um his is sort of one

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,080
of his ideas as being the founder and I

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,490
guess it should go without saying this

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,870
is a translation of one of his ideas

00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,230
because most of his ideas are actually

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,350
in Russian and that would be much less

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,870
useful for me to put up but but he he

00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,420
thought it was really important to to

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,230
liberate art and to make it available to

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,140
the masses and two and two to get it out

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:10,970
of the hands of you know of the gentry

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:14,950
and and also as a part of that to open

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,750
up open up sort of creative thought and

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,370
an imagination which i think is kind of

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,799
an important thing and something i think

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,120
that we tend to do a little bit

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,400
ourselves although we may not use the

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,350
word art for it pull out but same same

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,490
kind of thing um for him and and this is

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,710
well put them in date context in a

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,960
second for him one of the one of the big

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,210
he pieces for him was this idea of

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,230
psychological realism to us this isn't

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,460
particularly mind shattering because

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,340
every single thing that we watch that

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,720
has actors in it is based in basically

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,680
the tenants of psychological realism I

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,750
want to watch a human in front of me

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,460
behave as if they are another human and

00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,730
I would like for that to be somewhat

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,200
believable it turns out it's hard to

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,930
come up with tenants of psychological

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,330
realism before you have psychology it's

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,370
sort of a sort of a technological thing

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,150
that you've got it you've got to get to

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,640
there's another person you may have

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,340
heard that worked closely with them from

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,800
from school it's entirely possible that

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,420
you were bored to death by a English

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,790
teacher at some point in time who made

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,390
you read a probably bad translation of

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:27,600
one of Anton Chekhov's more famous plays

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,390
these are these are his probably four of

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,850
his his biggest there there have been

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,780
you know some bad film adaptations made

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,490
of these there's a really fascinating

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,640
one of Uncle Vanya called Vanya on

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,640
forty-second Street which is actually

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,900
based on people rehearsing for a

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,770
production of Uncle Vanya but it's it's

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,760
mostly it's it's it's theater geek or

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,830
English geek fodder as a brief aside for

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,600
that um if you have ever seen or read

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,110
one of these and didn't find yourself

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,120
laughing out loud a lot which most of us

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,310
don't apparently you're missing

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,440
something the the Russians find all of

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,870
this very funny and I don't but that's I

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,190
think that's just because I i clearly

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,190
clearly missed something in the

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,580
translation but it's a thing so anyway

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,470
so I'm so check often and Santos offski

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,320
sort of got together in in the in the

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,940
late eighteen hundreds 1897 to be exact

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,860
and there's actually a couple other

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,140
folks that were involved in this but but

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,900
very early on Stanislavski started doing

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,970
some shows from other people but also

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,180
check off the Muscat theater's

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,490
production of of check off work is sort

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,719
of where they leapt into into

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,150
international

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,430
importance they they founded it on on a

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,719
couple on a couple of key tenants one as

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,280
I mentioned this a little bit for with

00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:52,009
with sort of stanislavski's interest in

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,050
in democratizing things they were they

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:55,699
were very keen on popular seat prices

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,370
they wanted the normal people to be able

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,560
to afford it you know not just for the

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,110
for the gentry they they wanted very

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,370
much to work in an ensemble so they

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,960
didn't want there to be just like you

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,310
know one person dogmatically telling

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,229
everybody but to have a group of people

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,330
come together as a as a unit and

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,879
collaboratively make something and then

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,669
finally this idea of a realistic theatre

00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,590
there's a there's a fun a million-dollar

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,139
word okay it's not a million-dollar it's

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,870
like a ten-dollar word that comes up a

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,779
lot in talking about about realism which

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,969
is verisimilitude which is the which is

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,229
the appearance of being true or real and

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:32,650
the reason that this comes up and is

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,849
important is when you when you imagine

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,960
especially like when we get to film and

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,819
television to like that when you imagine

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,860
an actor doing something in your in your

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,870
you're close to them if they're just

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,610
sort of strutting around on stage like

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,930
striking weird poses they're going to

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,210
look like a person strutting around on

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,219
stage and strike and weird poses it

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,169
turns out that as as psychological

00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,779
beings we we can pick up on really

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:56,719
really minut cues in somebody's facial

00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,180
musculature and stuff like that to to do

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:04,759
things so if you if you don't sort of

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,050
land it right RI as receivers gets the

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,849
sense really quickly that something is

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,669
off and and we disconnect from from that

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:15,289
so this is this is also as they're doing

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,789
this the reason sort of this is

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,020
revolutionary is people were just

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,180
figuring out psychology around this

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,469
point in time for some context this

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,759
doesn't necessarily mean that one

00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,770
followed from the other these are these

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,080
are more sort of what the world was

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,370
doing around this time the the first

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,439
meeting of the International Congress of

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,390
psychology was happening in Paris in

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,120
eighteen eighty nine which is just a few

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,430
years before this Pavlov started doing

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,510
gotta started running the department he

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,430
worked at in st. Petersburg around 1891

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,589
the dogs thing didn't happen until 1901

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,959
but but still this is this is these are

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,610
the things that people are noodling

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,279
around with Freud's interpretation of

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,450
dreams came out in 1899 so so we're sort

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,640
of late eighteen hundreds early

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,880
nineteen hundreds this this idea that we

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,190
can we can dive into not just not just

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,060
psychology the idea of psychology been

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,800
around for a long time but have been

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,210
theoretically been it been philosophical

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,740
like you know Plato and Aristotle talked

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,940
about psychology but they're talking

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,590
about it from a from a theory

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,110
perspective that we've actually got sort

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,230
of experimental things and also people

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,940
trying to tie the psychology to the body

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,340
right like that there are their

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,680
physiological things that tie together

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,470
thoughts you have in your brain with

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,020
with the things that that to go on your

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,470
body so so this brings us back to our

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:33,740
friend Stanislavski who who basically

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,950
created a system of acting training that

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,820
was there was based around around psycho

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,230
physiology basically with the

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,390
understanding there's any relationship

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,580
between the mind and body right so if

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,440
you're if you're gonna if you want if

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,880
you want to achieve the goal of of

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,880
acting realistically in front of

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:55,520
somebody it's not it's not just enough

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:57,470
to to pretend to do something with your

00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,150
face because you're probably not good

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,070
enough to do that you your you can't

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,160
control all of your involuntary muscles

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,950
enough you really need to also engage an

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,050
inner and inner psychology so that

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,090
you're so that the the right the right

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,030
sort of things happen these are these

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,410
are sort of language so all of the idea

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,280
that those two are intrinsically

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,900
connected persists today literally every

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,260
actor you see at this point film

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,850
television on stage whatever bears most

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,480
of their acting training in some ways is

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,030
derived from this and this is with some

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,140
with a few exceptions this is the the

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:38,530
basis of where we're we're pretty much

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,660
everybody is doing their doing the work

00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,280
so some of the key ideas that that he

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,980
had that were that were sort of new or

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,840
that are largely associated to him he

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,360
had this idea they referred to it as a

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,680
magic what if and this is this is a

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,750
question you would have the answer that

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,850
actors asked what if I were in the same

00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,190
situation as the as the characters like

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,350
not just I need to walk to this point on

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,790
the stage over here but like what if I

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,990
were this character how would I how

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,710
would I respond in that in that

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,220
situation the the why why would I do

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,740
this why

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,879
what I do these things which is also one

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,069
of those one of the things at once you

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,680
sound sort of obvious but it was it was

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:17,089
sort of a big sort of crazy idea to

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
suggest that people should ask that

00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,689
question and then also of looking at

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,129
objectives what do I want not just why

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:24,560
do I want to do this but what I want to

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:27,829
accomplish in this in this moment what I

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,110
want to do so I mentioned this a little

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,209
bit on the on the checkoff slide if you

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,120
were bored by having to read any jackoff

00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:36,920
plays in school probably a good reason

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,870
for that is that not really much happens

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,689
in them there's there's almost no plot

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,050
its people sitting around depressed or

00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:48,350
angry talking to each other and and

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,110
that's you know awesome if you're an

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,120
actor man what you want to do is is dig

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,560
into this the action there is really in

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,899
the in the psychological interactions

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,480
with people not oh I got up and I you

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,579
know battled somebody with swords and we

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,930
you know conquered the the kingdom and

00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:07,850
and there were there were duels and

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:09,439
stuff in order to in order to tap into

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,660
these things part of the thing in Santa

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,910
zosky system was this idea of what he

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,860
called emotional memory and since the

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,180
idea that as a part of a training you

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,589
you go and you sort of walk back through

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,059
walk back through through memories you

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,879
have of things that have happened to you

00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:29,029
so like if you're trying to work on of

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,189
being I don't know sad you might you

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,839
might sort of think back to a sad thing

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,480
and that's that's step one oh I was sad

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,709
when this sad thing happened to me but

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,000
that's not really particularly all that

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,009
effective that's just you sitting there

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,730
remembering something that happened and

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,559
and you'll actually start to dig in

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,569
iteratively and you know start to start

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,069
to remember more and more details what

00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,990
was the what was happening what was the

00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,040
color of the of the walls in the room

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,240
that you were sitting in when you

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,100
remembered feeling this and eventually

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,279
you go through and you break down crying

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,139
which makes acting classes in college a

00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,949
lot of fun it's basically just learning

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:05,209
how to have Rick down and and there's

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,430
and there's some issues that come along

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,309
with this and and if you've if you know

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,399
much about things like therapy and those

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:15,620
sorts of things it's it's quite quite

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,870
similar techniques honestly uh for for a

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,339
different purpose rather than dealing

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,040
with those things because normally you

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,970
would you

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,970
sort of walk through these things of the

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,880
therapist and you would not with for the

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,440
for the goal of not being destroyed by

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,120
them all the time and enacting actually

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,949
you sort of want to dig them up and then

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,899
have them as a as a nice tool that you

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:37,800
can very quickly use to become

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,240
distraught for you so you know there's

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,850
some reasons that that people have some

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,670
some issues um similar link to that but

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,009
also linking the the mind the mind body

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,779
connection is this idea of sense memory

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,269
which is similar to but different than

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,490
the motional memory this is where you

00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:54,660
you might as an actor take a take a

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,899
thing and you'll be doing an exercise

00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,920
and you'll got two things so I've got

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,620
some coffee here and it's nice and warm

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,420
and I like to drink it because it tastes

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,370
like coffee yep that's lovely but but on

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,980
on stage I might not necessarily want to

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,149
have actual hot coffee because you know

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,680
something goes wrong I've just spilled

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,560
hot coffee on myself and now I'm

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,420
screaming on stage and so oftentimes

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,029
you'll actually just have say a glass of

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,319
normal temperature water but you don't

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,579
really want to look like you're drinking

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,660
normal temperature water on the stage

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,699
you want to look like you're drinking

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,180
coffee and so there's there's a whole

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:33,569
series of of exercises you'll go through

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,940
to to remember the sensations of the

00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:38,209
coffee so that you aren't pretending to

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,610
drink coffee you're actually trying to

00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:43,380
access memories of what what the

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,480
sensation of drinking coffee is like

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,120
it's it's kind of weird but um what kind

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,250
of cool if you like messing with and

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,839
hacking your own brain which is which is

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,490
a lot of this out so this is this is

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,990
referred to as inside out and it's a lot

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,510
like using a programming framework right

00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,660
you you don't if if what you're trying

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,480
to convey um manifests itself in lots

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,420
and lots of little tiny you know

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,339
nonverbal communication tix if you tried

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,839
to think about all of those individually

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,149
you would go mad it would sort of be

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,800
like writing a web page and assembly

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,670
language right like it just you could do

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,689
it but you would you would quickly melt

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,970
instead you want to you want to use

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:22,829
programming use things that handle a lot

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,750
of the details that you that you don't

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,990
really want to deal with on any given 11

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,360
given moment in time express what what

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,880
your you're doing and and sort of let

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,870
everything else sort itself out you know

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,960
so so get to keep

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,250
winds and let the framework handle it

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,990
and so you know so similar here you

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,700
manipulate your own internal

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,490
psychological self and the body will

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,200
just sort of handle it for you so if

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,870
anything about this is sounds even

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,230
remotely interesting there's a there's a

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,430
lovely book that lots of acting students

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,529
read called active repairs by

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,880
Stanislavski it's also written in

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,370
Russian but there are english

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,450
translations of it i don't recommend

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,960
reading the russian unless you read

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,730
Russian you know in case you won't do

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,240
that so this brings us to this guy named

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:12,390
Lee Strasberg so so Lee Strasberg was

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,380
he's actually an American I don't know

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,450
this weird thing he's born a czech

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,170
republic but but he's completely

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,370
associated with a new york move to move

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,710
to New York when he's actually born in

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,850
1901 i believe which means that right

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,250
around the time Stanislavski was getting

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,550
started he was just a young little

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,870
little thing but but what happened with

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,290
with lee strasberg and why it's

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:35,820
important to talk about is that the

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,410
Moscow Art Theater visited the u.s. in

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,020
1923 because well we didn't have the

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,250
Iron Curtain yet and you could still do

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,160
that at that point in time it's kind of

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,709
cool I guess we've gotten rid of the

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,150
Iron Curtain but um it was a big deal

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,700
for people for a long time anyway they

00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,100
visited the the u.s. in 1923 and this

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,720
this young young dish acting student

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,029
named Lee Strasberg went and saw them

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,400
and his mind was utterly blown like he

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,459
he he couldn't believe that everyone on

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,819
stage actually was invested in what they

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:08,550
were doing and they were they were all

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,500
they had such a such a deep sense of

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,030
realism with what was going on and the

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,429
the people who weren't speaking at that

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,630
want metal one moment in time weren't

00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,100
just back in the back thinking about

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,500
what they're gonna have for dinner which

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,819
is sort of what modern American acting

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,199
at that point in time was was largely

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,089
like there's a person speaking and a

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,170
bunch of bored people on stage waiting

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,319
for the next time that they get to say

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,460
something and whereas everybody in the

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,929
sand in the Moscow Art Theatre

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,790
production we're all connected and

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,270
living in the end of thing but again

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,710
this is this is how when we see when we

00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,540
see something that isn't a bunch of

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,380
people actually inhabiting the space we

00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,110
get really freaked out at this point

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,300
because it's become so much the norm so

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,290
he did what every good young student

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,530
does is he dropped out of school and

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,750
went to so today with russia

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:56,370
clearly it's never been a bad idea to do

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,960
that right so so he studied with him for

00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,190
a little bit and then got together with

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,800
a couple people harold clurman and

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,300
cheryl crawford and they started the

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,510
group theater in New York this should

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,100
not be confused with the group theater

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,040
in London which was a different set of

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,630
people in a different city the the group

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,760
theater itself amongst other things

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,830
believed in leaders leaderless operation

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,420
and collaborative work which I don't

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,220
know how much you know about what we do

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,900
in OpenStack depending on where you're

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,120
coming from but if you've done anything

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,980
with with the development side of

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,960
OpenStack that that concept might sound

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,050
familiar to you so for what it's worth

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,390
we we didn't invent it other people have

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,400
done it before and to great success the

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,070
group theatre actually was one of the

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,520
most important theaters in in New York

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,810
in the in the in the 30s considered in a

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,170
lot of ways to be like the the

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,480
conscience of of the country around the

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,780
depression Europe they actually did a

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,380
show called called waiting for for lefty

00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,480
which was about taxi workers strike but

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,700
but people after the opening performance

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,950
literally rioted in the streets after

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,830
the after the the performance which I

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,080
cannot even come close to imagining

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,490
going to the theater and then being so

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
incensed by the topic that i saw in

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,050
front of me to go out into the streets

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,630
and riot about it this is just i mean

00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,550
maybe a hockey game but you know not not

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,670
so much theater so um the Lee Strasberg

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,380
of similar to based on tennis off skis

00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,540
work did all of something called the

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,730
method now of the various things that

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm blathering on about in the world of

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,690
acting it's possible you've heard of the

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,520
method largely because of all of the the

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,910
jokes that you might make about method

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,680
actors and you know it has a lot of

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,600
really famous practitioners Marlon

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,790
Brando being one of the early ones to

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,750
get a lot of credit for that but also

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,980
modern day folks like Christian Bale and

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,510
Daniel day-lewis and philip seymour

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,980
hoffman and Heath Ledger all of whom are

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,650
of course either dead or insane so it

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,049
which you might understand based on the

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,230
idea of the the delving interior

00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:09,299
emotional memory to to inhabit a thing

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,530
so the thing is is that Strasburg really

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,059
latched on an emotional memory thing

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,549
like that was that was his thing he's

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,990
like yep this this one tenant that Santa

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,850
saucing came up with I'm gonna take that

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,980
and it's it's going to be the basis of

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,590
everything we do there's there's few

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,299
differences so he renamed emotional

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,799
memory to affective memory which is

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,840
actually amusing because the original

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,890
psychological term on which emotional

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,220
memory is based is actually called

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,010
effector memory so he s aligned with

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,290
psychological texts he there's a there's

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,840
on mild difference in how he would

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,850
express stanislavski's what if which he

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,549
called substitution which is what would

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,530
make me as this actor behave in the way

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,110
that the character does right so so part

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,610
of the part of the goal there is not not

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,260
to not to imagine what your character

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,179
would do but to figure out what you need

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,850
to do to yourself so that you'll do the

00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:00,330
thing that your character would do which

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,610
is a little bit so anecdotally uh as a

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,040
way to explain that I was at this bar in

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,160
New York as you do sometimes and is

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,720
talking to this guy and he he was a

00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,090
studying at the at the actor studio

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,460
which is the current place where the

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:16,290
method acting is like legit strasburg

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,270
based method acting has taught and he

00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,880
was explaining to me that that in his

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,500
process he did not study his lines that

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,700
was not a thing that happened at all

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,980
instead his process was to was to just

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,710
do all of the emotional work and get to

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,540
the point where one day magically he was

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,950
in the place where the thing he wanted

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,549
to do was to say the thing that the

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:41,610
character would would be required to say

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,530
by the script next and so there was no

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,910
memorization it was try to trick

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,510
yourself to get into the psychological

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,429
state of that he it I asked him if that

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,390
wasn't entirely terrifying because I

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:53,190
didn't really seem like a very

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,110
repeatable process and he's like yeah no

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,400
it's it's it's awful you're justyou're

00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,980
you have no idea what you're doing and

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,809
then one day magically you you you know

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,590
you do and it's like what happens if

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,970
that date isn't coming he's like yeah oh

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,919
so um so yeah so there's a there's a

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,380
real clear danger problem here right um

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,410
I mean I I mentioned it briefly earlier

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,840
but I mean quite honestly

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,300
we've had recent deaths by both Heath

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Ledger and philip seymour hoffman who

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:24,170
are practitioners of this and and those

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,490
were not unemotional on psychological in

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,470
nature the the thing that they went

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,880
through everybody else other than

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,970
strasbourg basically walked away from

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,190
from this idea of hacking hacking one

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:38,090
psychological state quite this intensely

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,230
I think for good reason so so one of the

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,090
first people to walk away from from

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,920
Strasbourg sky named Stanford Meisner

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,330
one of the other issues he had with the

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,850
emotional memory idea is that he thought

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,140
that it caused people to focus on

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,360
themselves too but you're asking what

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,770
would make me as a human do this thing

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,390
which means that basically you're just

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,030
narcissistically thinking about yourself

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,980
the entire time and so so meissner's

00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,960
techniques then let off in the world of

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,790
just pay attention to the to the other

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,710
person actually listen to what they say

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,980
and so you do these exercises where

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,870
where you'll just be given a line and

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,250
you're you're there with your partner

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:14,120
and neither one of you is supposed to

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,090
speak until an actual impulse causes you

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,050
to need to say your your line you paired

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,100
it back and forth to each other it's

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,170
it's some pretty thing but the

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,210
concentration is on the other person and

00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,190
and that the sort of his catchphrases is

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,600
trying to live truthfully under

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,000
imaginary circumstances so you want to

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,040
be doing normal things but in a in a

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,980
weird circumstance is also another

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,510
another lady named Stella Adler she

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,430
broke from Meisner when she went and

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,650
studied with Stanislavski himself after

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,570
all so she's Leo following meissner's

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,950
teachings and then she had the

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,780
opportunity to go to Russia and hang out

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,400
or actually to Paris which is where

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,440
Anasazi was and she came back she's like

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,510
oh so Stanislavski has totally moved on

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,220
from all of this like he everything that

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,350
you're that you're learning from him

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,260
he's doing he's thinks it's all crap and

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,300
he's done all this other new stuff and

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,250
so from her she wanted a lot of that to

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,520
come from from imagination rather than

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,230
from just from from your past another

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,070
woman which is one of the things that I

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:12,340
studied Lena Hagen who was an actress

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,390
and then started teaching other people

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,490
there's there's a fascinating thing that

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,830
that happens in the nude ahah ghen world

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,510
oh it's fascinating me it's probably not

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,760
as many materials but um but you

00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,990
actually spend a lot of time just doing

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,090
mundane things so you'll actually do

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,309
these these things called

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,039
basic object exercises where you'll

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,779
bring like half of your bedroom into the

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,220
theater and set it up so that sort of

00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:37,159
like your bedroom and then you'll work

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,539
really hard on doing tasks that you

00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,450
would do at home in front of a group of

00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:43,250
people like say ironing you know and it

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,390
turns out ironing in front of people and

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,490
not looking like you're showing them

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,360
that you're ironing is insanely hard

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,460
because you've got a bunch of people

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,250
watching you and it turns out you're not

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,289
in your bedroom you're in the theater

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,990
ironing and while we don't really all

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,090
want to go see a play about ironing it's

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,649
it's sort of you know get ironing right

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,789
and then you can work on doing something

00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:03,500
exciting like you know save the

00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:07,520
president from you know terrorists or

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,549
something so so at this point I'm sure

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,390
everyone in the room is well past asking

00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:15,950
the question what the heck does this

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:19,309
have to do with OpenStack and and I I

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,690
promise it has some me do with it so

00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,460
there's a couple things one of the

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,700
things all these people shared a shared

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,990
of purpose it was it was a clear purpose

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,539
and they and they understood what it was

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,520
um that's to create truth and realistic

00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,049
acting right now there's there's four or

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,570
five different six different you know

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,429
sort of schools of thought and and ways

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,049
in which that's that's interacted with

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,820
but it's all really clear what they want

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,620
they want that there's understanding

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,590
that there's a psychological state and a

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,860
mix between the mind and the body that

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,720
that creates an environment in which a

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,909
fewer is going to pick up on certain

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,320
detail work and rather than try and dig

00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,570
into all that a tail work detail by

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,409
detail to be able to get at that and so

00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,700
they either go ahead and try it

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:01,429
different ways but it's really the same

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,730
the same thing so if you put you know if

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:07,220
you put pacino who's I think also said

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,710
was cell Adler on stage with you know

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,880
Anne Hathaway who studied in I can't

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,289
remember where but like you know that

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,789
this different schools but you put them

00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:15,470
on stage and we watch them have a scene

00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,669
together we're not going to be sitting

00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,230
there or we shouldn't be sitting there

00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:20,600
going oh well clearly he's a Meisner

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,919
actor and she's an ad litter and I can I

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,470
can I can see how that's going that

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,539
would be insane as a consumer of what

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,100
they're doing there's there's a clear

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,899
thing that they do and everybody knows

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,850
what it is there's no questions about it

00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:34,340
it's not like you know it's kind of a

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,720
thing um so yeah so they shared

00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,690
approaches they also diverge

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,700
substantially from each other an example

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,010
of this and I mentioned

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,080
briefly is the the sanus offski

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,179
catchphrase what would I do if I were in

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,649
the circumstance the Strasbourg one is

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,510
what would motivate me the actor to

00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,429
behave the way the character does these

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,340
are kind of esoteric differences like

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:56,320
you've really gotta want to dig in to

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,830
really be like oh yes no I totally see

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,480
how one of those is like really

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,860
importantly different than the other one

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,649
like otherwise we're just were sort of

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,019
we're sort of picking picking at a

00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,980
differences so I didn't actually answer

00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:12,970
the question what this has to do with

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,649
open sec and I'm not going to yet so I'm

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,549
going to talk about another person named

00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:21,970
Tadashi suzuki so Tadashi suzuki is a

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:24,220
Japanese um director and theatre

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,149
practitioner that he started off with a

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,970
little bit of a different problem

00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:30,730
amusingly it had to do with check off

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:33,250
but he he saw some people came to Japan

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,889
did the opposite reaction as Strasbourg

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,899
basically I some some people came and

00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:40,269
did a check off play in Japan and he got

00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:43,320
really unhappy because it was a bunch of

00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:46,899
japanese people dressed like westerners

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,090
walking around doing things in the ended

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,610
you know with this type of training he's

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,320
like well they're showing me a thing

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,820
that's supposed to be real but it's not

00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,220
resonating with me it's not it's not

00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,350
true in in a sense that makes any sense

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,389
based on my background in my and our

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,850
sort of cultural whatever this is this

00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:05,289
is people being inhabiting bodies that

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,179
are not they're not there they're not

00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:08,830
Japanese right there they're not doing a

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,450
that there's they've lost the

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,720
fundamental Japanese pneus of themselves

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,370
in trying to behave like Russians you

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,039
know doing doing realistic check off

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,470
stuff umm so so Suzuki thought a lot of

00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,639
this Hydra with the feet he became he

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,559
became really obsessed with the

00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:27,010
connection between the foot and the in

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:29,139
the ground because at least from my

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,880
understanding not having been a member

00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:33,580
of Japanese society myself this is only

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,590
hearsay but based on on his his writings

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,210
he you know a lot of there there's a

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,419
there's a lot more sort of barefoot or

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,460
or very very thin foot covering things

00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,860
traditionally in Japan and so he was

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,909
also sort of largely upset about all the

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,830
Japanese people walking around wearing

00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:51,010
western-style shoes he's like you're

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,120
losing your connection to your to your

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,290
environment so the connection the ground

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,440
was really important

00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,180
took the exact opposite approach on the

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,370
on the connection between the psychology

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,310
and the body which is you are the

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,770
outside in route create a condition in

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,780
he'd like didn't disagree that you

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:10,630
needed to have both engaged but created

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,700
condition in the body and that condition

00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,010
will cause some sort of internal

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,150
psychological life to emerge the

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,120
condition in the body and his world

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,260
needs to be actually rather extreme and

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,180
he's also not going for psychological

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,760
realism so if he has people like

00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,350
stomping around on stage that's that's

00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,150
okay even though none of us do that in

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,100
real life he wasn't as concerned about

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:33,060
that so so he wanted a thing that was

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:38,740
true if not necessarily you know

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,940
verisimilitude real right so one of the

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,800
one of the first main things he did was

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,250
a production of Euripides is the Trojan

00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,140
women which you may imagine Euripides

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,720
did not write it with any sort of

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:53,050
Japanese theatre styling in mind being

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,740
the reputations Creek and a couple

00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:58,930
thousand years older than the Suzuki but

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,470
to do this he drew from from the no

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,520
kabuki and shingeki trendy traditions

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,810
and in fact actually if you want to

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,210
really geeked out on it he drew from a

00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,680
couple different forms of kabuki both

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,940
modern and traditional and that was like

00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,080
really there were people who are like

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,090
really freaked out a bit like oh my gosh

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,350
you put a you put a modern kabuki and a

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,950
traditional kabuki person on the same

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,300
stage and we're confused but he sort of

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,980
sips out together and he wanted to

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,500
produce a thing that was true to the

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,540
modern Japanese sensibility um he then

00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,020
developed a training excellent he failed

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,100
for training because when you do shows

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,720
for a long period of time you know

00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,010
actors need to cycle out of it and need

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,570
to replace them with other actors and

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,940
he'd sort of developed this on his feet

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:40,270
um kind of kind of like I don't know

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,980
just installing a large public cloud by

00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,350
hand and then later on figuring out that

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,090
you needed updated it and and realizing

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,620
oh crap I didn't put any automation in

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,790
place I should probably come o some sort

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,940
of system where I can I can do this

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:55,750
might be a stretch of Avenal G but you

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,340
know that's what we got so so he then

00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,500
started collaborating with woman named

00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,820
and Bogart know so there's a couple

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,620
different companies that do suzuki

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,500
things the city company is based in

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,090
saratoga springs in new york and as part

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,850
of a collaboration between Tadashi's

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,830
ki and woman en Bogart I mean and this

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,140
took Suzuki's techniques and added to

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,460
them a thing that I'm burger / together

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,590
called viewpoints which she got from a

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,840
lady named Mary overly from NYU Razak

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,850
sure about modern dance and there's a

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,380
whole big New York schism because an

00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,450
Bogart teaches at Columbia which is in

00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,070
the upper west and NYU is down in the

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,750
village and and Mary overly

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,980
practitioners hate and Bogart because

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,540
they're different views on the

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,390
viewpoints are different and it's all

00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,730
silly but we won't go into that too much

00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:40,090
here because of all way down the road

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,250
anyway there's another group called p3 a

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,350
specific performance project started by

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,820
Robin hunt and Steve Pearson and they

00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,920
studied actually in Japan with suzuki

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,480
for about 12 years and then he's like

00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,610
you know you should go teach this in the

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,890
US and so he sort of blessed them going

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,800
off and teaching similar to adding the

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,840
viewpoints to the stuff for the city

00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,450
company they did also some work with

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,640
this guy named shoga auto otah excuse me

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,280
with with his idea of slow tempo so like

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,950
extreme slow motion movement on stage in

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,000
a very sort of balletic way and then

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,260
finally actually amusingly enough

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,020
there's a company here in Brisbane

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,520
called Frank if you've if you've never

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,840
seen any of their work and you're from

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,400
here you should definitely check out

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,560
something to do if you've never seen any

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,780
work and you're not from here it's a

00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,850
little harder but they do actually at or

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,740
internationally sometimes and and they

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,110
they also said it with Suzuki brought

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,970
things back and then wanted to add more

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,620
Australian asst to that so in some of

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,030
the exercises in traditional Suzuki

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,170
there will be things that you do and

00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,850
there will be like you know traditional

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,040
Japanese flute playing or what or not

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,030
and if you work Frank you know you're

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,180
more likely to get something like nick

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:45,510
cave or something of that nature which

00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,850
brings i'll tell you a very different

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:51,210
working environment from Japanese

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:54,130
traditional Japanese flute music

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,320
ultimately this is all this is all a

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,820
tool right this these are all an actor

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,190
actually might study all I've actually

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:04,690
studied I have not studied Stella Adler

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:07,290
I've directly studied Frank Suzuki p3

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:10,600
Suzuki city company suzuki and

00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:14,080
Stanislavski and Strasburg and Meisner

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,000
and huda Hagen haven't done any other

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,710
that's ok because each of these

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,270
techniques can be useful for different

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,230
things right like they're not it's not

00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,940
just

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,130
there's there's a few people out there

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:27,400
who are like hardcore practitioners of

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,200
one one way of doing something most

00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,510
people actually want to learn as many of

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,520
these things as they can so that they

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:37,510
can approach the the problem the problem

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:40,290
at hand with a with a full different

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,820
hangs I missed a typo that's terrible

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,860
they are useful tools for different

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,620
hangs if you if you know what a hang is

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,820
then you've truly gotten the the

00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:53,049
fundamental substance of the talk

00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,840
they're all very useful tools for

00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:56,770
different things each of these each of

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,679
these people has done things with

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:02,410
Shakespeare Shakespeare had absolutely

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,240
no relation to either psychological

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,610
realism or and we might think it because

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,440
you see enough Kenneth Branagh and you'd

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,270
think that that all you know all

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,649
Shakespeare was was somebody you know

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:13,000
producing a bunch of lines for somebody

00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,830
to say in a really breathy kind of

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,200
whispery voice and being really intense

00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,840
but in fact that has just couldn't be

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,300
further from from how Shakespeare was

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,950
the time in fact actually apparently one

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,540
should do Shakespeare with a southern US

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,750
accent because that's closest to what

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:32,590
the Elizabethan accent was the time but

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:35,590
but I'm digressing if that could be even

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,210
possible at this point but supplied the

00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,909
techniques to Shakespeare and so and you

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,850
can you can do that to produce ultimate

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:45,460
you want which is a good oh and the

00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:48,129
revealed Jaya subsided a weird thing oh

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,359
that's terrible well we're going to have

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,490
some fun slides here in a second because

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,710
clearly i edited something blind before

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,950
getting up here and and messed up an

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,300
HTML tag so so this gets us to the

00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,680
obvious question is why why am I talking

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,040
about acting techniques at an openstack

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,020
Minicon at PyCon I you which I will now

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,300
attempt to explain to you in a way that

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,230
doesn't cause you to just beat me

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,880
senseless so there's there's there's

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,050
four takeaways from from all these

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,450
actors and we're just going to have to

00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,550
live with Shakespeare of being behind

00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,900
behind all of those takes you so the

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,950
four takeaways are Shakespeare shakes

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,300
for your Shakespeare and Shakespeare

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,580
even though I didn't really talk about

00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,369
him at all this is going to drive me

00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,040
crazy so hopefully it'll it'll drive you

00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:31,210
guys a little bit less crazy one is that

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,619
they know what the problem they're

00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,619
trying to solve this right that's it

00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,109
that's a

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,150
whether it's the weather it's the

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:41,059
psychological realism whether it's the

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,559
the sort of truth in physicality they

00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:44,299
understand what it is and they

00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,069
understand what it what it isn't they

00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:48,440
developed techniques to solve that

00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:49,579
problem not they didn't develop

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,230
techniques because they want to develop

00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:52,700
techniques none of these people started

00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,009
life saying you know what I really want

00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,990
to do I want to I want to develop an

00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:58,970
acting technique they were all I've got

00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,369
this problem I'm not happy with what's

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,349
going on I'm going to now develop a

00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,029
technique to solve that problem and then

00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:07,099
apply that problem then you can it

00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,839
either worked or it didn't you you

00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:12,049
completely can't read that because of

00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,269
the Shakespeare overlay but that they

00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:15,609
they don't confuse the technique with

00:36:14,269 --> 00:36:20,390
the results almost none of these people

00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:22,519
show you their acting exercises on stage

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,680
you should be very glad about that I

00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,390
enjoy watching people do acting

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,900
exercises for hours on end most people

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,609
would not these are these are tools and

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,150
techniques that we use in order to get

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:36,259
the results which is an enjoyable thing

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,289
and then the thing you really can't read

00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:42,710
because it's because HTML and you should

00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,960
just never let me edit HTML directly is

00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,720
is that that there there's a there's a

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,749
willingness and almost all of them to to

00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,400
change with new information so a lot of

00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,989
these had to do with there's a thing and

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,579
now i'm going to take in new information

00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:57,769
i'm going to adapt and i'm going to i'm

00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:59,930
going to move on I sort of wish that

00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:03,160
this draw a sword strasburg would have

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:07,039
done a little bit more of that so so for

00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,660
for us oh so so as I mentioned there's a

00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,400
there's a problem are we chasing

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,190
psychological realism you know are we

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,549
are we chasing physical truth for us in

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,140
the openstack world I I think we've got

00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:19,759
some some key questions right are we

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,369
making a toolkit for people to use to

00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:24,079
build clouds okay this is this is

00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,170
actually almost gonna work out properly

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,549
I'm really really freaked out or make it

00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,619
tool for toolkit for people to use to

00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,930
build clouds um or making a cloud that

00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:35,599
can be deployed in in multiple places

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,489
because those are those those maybe

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,359
those may be similar but they're

00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,710
actually they're actually quite

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,930
different in terms of what it is that

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,720
we're trying to what what it is we're

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,390
trying to do are we providing computers

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,859
or are we providing something different

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:52,029
computers and the great thing is is that

00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:53,109
I'm standing up in front of you so I

00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:56,769
could tell you what I want us to be

00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:58,960
doing I can't claim that this is what we

00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:02,140
all want to do but uh we're not all

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,640
standing up here i am so haha and what i

00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:08,440
want us to do in openstack clearly a

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,900
Shakespeare that's why I do want

00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,529
Shakespeare that would be that would be

00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,119
fantastic I think we should rewrite a

00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:23,470
openstack in Elizabethan I ambach

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:24,970
pentameter and uh yeah so i would like

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,130
to i would like to say that i would like

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,440
for openstack to provide computers and

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:34,180
networks that work now that might sound

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,799
insanely basic but but there's a there's

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,690
a sort of a different there are some

00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:40,599
completely valid two different world

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,730
views then I want a thing that behaves

00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,430
like a computer that is on a network

00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,619
that behaves like a network that works

00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,089
and interacts with things other people

00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,180
want what other other stuff out of that

00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:54,039
and I'll talk briefly about that in just

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,400
a second although people also want

00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,630
Shakespeare apparently the follow-up to

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,910
that is I think that we should stop

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,769
chasing 12 factor apps I think that we

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,289
are are not the right I think that when

00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:07,180
we this is part of the people learn and

00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:08,890
adapt I believe that when we started

00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,650
OpenStack um this was a great thing to

00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,599
chase a lot of things didn't exist at

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,880
that point in time and the conventional

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,640
wisdom about what you use an API driven

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,500
dynamic cloud for our are these are

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,259
these you know sort of newfangled 12

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,359
factor app things um I think that now

00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:27,519
that we've got things like kuru Nettie's

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,099
and core OS and and all of the rest of

00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,470
the of the you know docker madness and

00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:35,410
everything I think us trying to chase

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:38,289
these is kind of ludicrous so so us

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,619
chasing a thing that looks really

00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:43,450
lightweight and thin is we're never

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:45,099
going to do that as well as the as the

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:47,109
is the Cooper Nettie's container

00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,960
orchestration people but what we can do

00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:52,000
is we can provide a very nice home for

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,710
those frameworks because it turns out if

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,720
you have a cooper Nettie's oracle or os

00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,819
it has to run somewhere it still has to

00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,300
run on some machines right in fact you

00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:00,920
go read the Cooper Nettie's installed

00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,060
imitation the first and you know if

00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,680
you're doing it sort of manually not

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,360
with one of their one click it's like so

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,310
it's great that you that you set up all

00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
the networking first now you can get

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,980
started with goober Nettie's I'm like

00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,690
yeah it is great that I set up all the

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,850
networking first it'd be great if a

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,260
cloud could do that for me um but all of

00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,670
these things are things that that behave

00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,010
more like traditional networks and

00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,690
computers like not like little ephemeral

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:24,380
you know floaty things that fly around

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,790
in the air of course if any of you have

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,220
ever talked to me on any purpose

00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,330
whatsoever I think that opens actually

00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,280
by default give me a directly routable

00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,260
IP and I think that should actually be

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,240
assigned to my computer and my computer

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,660
should note it is I believe that there

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,250
are valid reasons to opt into doing

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,540
something different than that but I

00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,720
think that those are all advanced than

00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:47,120
you should need to opt into doing those

00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,890
and I believe I'm actually at time which

00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,550
means that have gotten to the thing so

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:55,040
so like I said Shakespeare and also

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:58,220
these will be online in a little bit and

00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm more than happy to to take drinks

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,530
with people the entire time we're here

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,530
and you can you can you know lambaste me

00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:10,840
for way too much information on acting

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,840
theory so anyway thank you much

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,140
