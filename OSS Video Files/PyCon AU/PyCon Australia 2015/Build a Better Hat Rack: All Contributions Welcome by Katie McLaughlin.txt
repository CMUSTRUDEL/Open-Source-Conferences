Title: Build a Better Hat Rack: All Contributions Welcome by Katie McLaughlin
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	We have many ways of reporting and recognising our code contributions in open source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code commits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed. Hours of code review, documentation, testing; organising of meetups and volunteering at conferences; even just brainstorming and talking about things - how much of these have you done without accreditation? 

During this session, we will discuss what it means to contribute to open source projects, what constitutes a non-code contribution, steps we can take to recognise the work of our peers, and how projects can better encourage non-code participation through recognition and acknowledgement.

#LABHR is an original concept by Leslie Hawthorn, http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

hi guys we're gonna get started yay also

00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,310
next up we've got Katie McLaughlin katie

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,770
is a senior systems engineer working to

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,390
automate all the things when she's not

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,700
changing the world she enjoys making

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,500
tapestries cooking and yelling at

00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,270
javascript and its attempt at global

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,960
variables put your hands together for

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,960
Katie McLaughlin

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,850
get a so this is a double room and I'm

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,620
not exactly sure where to stand because

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:51,970
not everyone's gonna be able to see me

00:00:45,620 --> 00:01:03,680
anyway is the camera okay everywhere

00:00:51,970 --> 00:01:06,470
okay cool thank you okay hi I'm Katie um

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,820
I have hidden my twitter ID on this

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,119
slide I'm not sure whether you will be

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,880
able to find it so high I do computer

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,200
things a lot of different computer

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,149
things and it's really great because

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,800
even though i'm at a Python conference

00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:21,789
everyone's been really nice to me

00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,259
because obviously I identify as a

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:28,940
diversity member you know being a ruby

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:30,770
developer and if I keep the slide up for

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,149
long enough a YouTube might get really

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,860
confused with the title slide and be

00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:37,670
people walking into this room get really

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,110
confused but no um I do a lot of stuff

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,479
that's not Ruby I do a whole lot of

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,880
system administration stuff and I have

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,220
actually worked on docker and OpenStack

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,259
things dog has actually paid me money to

00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,250
fix things and that's cool and I'm also

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:55,520
a OpenStack ATC because all you have to

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,579
do is to get a active technical

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,210
contributor title is just get one

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,960
commits accepted upstream would you like

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,780
to know what I got accepted upstream

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,110
that the fact that there is

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,110
documentation

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,260
the fact there was documentation in the

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,380
Nova Python client that said that a get

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:24,970
volumes actually deleted things that had

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,560
been in there since 2011 um yeah people

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,040
need to read their comments because

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,280
they're kind of important Oh as an aside

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,140
if you are were to actually do this

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,599
OpenStack will give you a free ticket to

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,769
attend the next awesome something that

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
they have and the next one is going to

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,239
be Tokyo and apparently it's going to be

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,890
really cool and if there's any OpenStack

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,269
II sprint stuff happening then you

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,030
should totally get involved because

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,319
openstax awesome isn't it people in the

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,220
room that should raise their hands if

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:59,110
they are an ATC or higher and OpenStack

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,760
there's one to see this is these people

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,880
are helping with open source

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,220
contributions and everything's awesome

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,900
but how do we actually know this apart

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,780
from me heckling from the stage and

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,819
making people raise their hands you

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,980
could use github and look at what people

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:17,230
have committed on github except that's

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,690
not really all that good and I will get

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,239
back to github later in the OpenStack

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,799
well you can use stack analytics which

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,150
does some really nice graphs and

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,769
everything including for documentation

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,829
because documentation is really

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,290
important but in the OpenStack world

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,930
documentation is a first class citizen

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,140
and every bit of documentation is in its

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,340
own get repo so everything has nice

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,380
statistics and commits and all that kind

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,209
of fun stuff you also have this really

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,970
awesome thing called the open-source

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,010
report card because github used to show

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,780
data based on the language of what you

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,850
committed so you can see I'm doing all

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,579
Python and a little bit of C because my

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,940
boss hates me unfortunately they github

00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,410
repo the github API for repo has changed

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,829
and does not expose that information

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,850
anymore so that really doesn't work but

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:09,489
what about everything else so straw poll

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:14,019
who here has ever gone to a local meetup

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,970
in their city or another city who here

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:18,400
has ever helped out organizing one of

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,890
these meetups who here has ever been to

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,050
a conference about a programming

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,050
language if your hands not up now

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,060
just by being here you are contributing

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,480
you might just be listening but in

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,220
physics every single system where you

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,320
have an interaction there is always

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,780
going to be some sort of effect or the

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,910
system even just observing it has an

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,350
effect and just by being here you're

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:55,130
having an effects everyone should clap

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:57,380
their hands science so apart from me

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,560
raising hands and making everyone clap

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,080
how can we actually actively acknowledge

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,740
and respect all that stuff that we do

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,800
that's not code there's this really

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,920
wonderful person is the whole thorn how

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,660
many of you know Leslie okay for those

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,330
of you who don't know Leslie she is an

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,950
amazing human being she has organized

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,250
hundreds of meetups does some a

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,720
brilliant community management work

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,270
she's awesome and everyone should try to

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,180
be just like her and make everyone happy

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,220
and feel better what she did was she did

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,580
a little tiny blog post called let's all

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,740
build hat racks there's a hashtag and if

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,600
I don't see at least 10 new things on

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,020
that hashtag by the end of this talk I'm

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,910
not going to leave the state no um so

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,350
there's a link to the blog post if you

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,010
don't actually listen to me just go read

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,840
it but what she's done is she's made a

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,630
really nice manual of how we can

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,700
acknowledge non-code contributions and

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,280
open source which I've turned into a

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,680
little talk about hat racks and don't

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,870
worry about the name of the ikea item

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,350
it's just a bad pun no no it's actually

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:11,510
bad pun in Swedish for anyone that reads

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,130
Swedish so five simple steps but first I

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,220
have to tell a story because this all

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,770
happened at LCA 2015 last year where

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,660
Leslie had a wonderful conversation with

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,280
a really nice lady called Deb Nicholson

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,920
who's involved with the open innovation

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,650
network which does a whole lot of shared

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,560
painting stuff so I went so you you

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,360
won't sue me some really nice things and

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,880
neither of them really identifies

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,160
programmers so neither of them really

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,319
have a way of showing what they do in

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,610
the commune

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:47,210
they both involved in a Sahara

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,590
innovation board and Deb said this is

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,090
really great I actually have something

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,560
that I can put on my LinkedIn and it's a

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:57,080
really nice place to hang my hat and

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,449
Leslie just went Wow I'm going to take

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,550
this and run with it so what she's done

00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,139
is she created this blog post and a

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,689
hashtag and it's gotten quite a bit of

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,610
traction all around the world about ways

00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,080
that we can actually help acknowledge

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,789
what people are doing in the community

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,069
so five simple steps write a list dot

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,729
points pros doesn't matter what it has

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:22,400
to be write a list about someone else

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,520
and how Olson they are and send it to

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,069
them that's it that's all she wanted you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,400
to do except of course there's extra

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,500
bonus points if you put it on Twitter or

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,810
on linkedin then other people will be

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,979
able to see it as well using the hashtag

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,379
or recommendations on linkedin plus the

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,029
extra gravy is she puts it do it for

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,699
someone not like you so if you're a

00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,500
developer acknowledge the fact that

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,060
you're testing person puts in a lot of

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,949
hours and does a whole lot of really

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,349
nice things for you your designers your

00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,960
writers anyone who works on your

00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:00,919
projects that doesn't actually do code

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,110
and everyone's great this thing got so

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,610
much traction she was getting all these

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,969
floods of tweets and it's been going

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,759
around and it's been really awesome

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:14,810
except that it hasn't really been sort

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,250
of it hasn't been as good as that what

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,009
it could be because I think some people

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,310
really didn't understand how to be nice

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,889
to people and that's it really that's a

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,080
really bad thing to say but I've been

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:29,479
doing a lightning talk around a couple

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,199
of places now where I just do the five

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,219
things and then i'll get one response so

00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,329
Pikkon will awesome enough to give me

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,610
half an hour to describe how you

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,669
actually be nice to people and this is

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,199
it so I'm going to tell you exactly how

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,899
to be nice to people and I'm the person

00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:46,270
that you ring up and yes lots of ikea

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,340
iconography in this

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,840
Creative Commons something please don't

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,160
sue me so first of all on Twitter you

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,370
write something nice about someone and

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,260
you use the hashtag so there's this

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,670
really person really nice person in the

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,340
audience called Chris who you may have

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,610
seen he's right there I have a laser

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,290
pointer I can point it out so what Chris

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,310
is done with the t-shirts that everyone

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,170
got is not only are there unisex cuts

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,600
and female cuts is actually a secondary

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,830
female cut of t-shirts there are three

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,910
different types of t-shirts and they

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,510
come in all these different colors and

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,270
that's really nice so someone tweeted

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,560
him about it and Chris really didn't

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,970
understand what was going on because if

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,200
someone complements you on Twitter

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,210
that's weird apparently so I had to go

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,790
in and actually clarify the fact that we

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,140
think you are awesome and I actually got

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,430
an entire River people clapping and I

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,430
can do it again go on Wow

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,530
it's chris is bloody awesome and I can

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,450
say bloody cuz it's pg-13 rated would be

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,490
yes and apparently this was nicely

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:00,300
accepted and I got a smiley face back so

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,210
it's like hey um so yeah that's as easy

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,050
as it is just be nice it's really not

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:09,870
that hard speaking of being nice

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,450
linkedin I'm not endorsing linkedin I

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,630
think linkedin serves a purpose but I

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,130
think it is a little bit awful

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:21,750
unfortunately it is sort of the pseudo

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:24,990
such Flair it is the sort of standard

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:28,460
now not ingest an IT but across all

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,070
different sectors as a online resume and

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,680
social media thing just don't write

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,160
pulse things that's awful but what you

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,380
can do on linkedin is you can write

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,630
endorsements sorry you can click the

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,190
little buttons endorse people and have a

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,660
little counter that goes up but you can

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,150
also write recommendations which is

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,010
their pros and these things are really

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,040
good except for the fact that the person

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,010
getting the thanks needs to actually put

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,480
down what they do now these are the

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,570
different categories you can put down

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,940
there the main ones being the experience

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,940
and the education but there's all these

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,760
other ones there linkedin will not let

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,580
you endorse we're sorry linton will not

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,060
let you recommend someone unless it is

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,440
listed as experience or education so all

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,520
this other stuff about volunteering and

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,980
everything else you can't actually

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,830
recommend someone for so you've only got

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,620
these two but if you want to put down

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,290
say Iran Kiwi pycon or I do a whole lot

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,300
of stuff with Python you really have to

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,030
put that under experience but that's the

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,770
good thing this is experience it's not

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,170
volunteering it's experience it's real

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,330
world stuff it's just as important as

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,790
having to write Java for a day job

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,990
because you're helping the community so

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,330
if somebody asks you Tom if they can

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,740
actually recommend you then you actually

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,690
have to put on the fact that you

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,520
directed an entire bloody conference on

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,710
linkedin and then people can say thank

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,210
you because this guy ran entire

00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,030
conference and I didn't even know and

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,190
I've known him for you

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:07,300
so I think anyone needs another clap cuz

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:09,130
I like being nice so yes oh and on the

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,220
skills and endorsements thing according

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,570
to that I know python which is wrong but

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:19,480
then again no one's actually endorsed me

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,030
for table flipping yet fun fact if you

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,310
add your own things they're all freeform

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,350
but you cannot add them to other

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,450
people's stuff so you can indulge me for

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,060
table flipping but I can't make you have

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,250
random things like knowing things that

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,970
aren't in their proper list in it I

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:44,020
don't like LinkedIn but it's a system

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:46,150
it's a awful creepy yes creepy is a good

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,470
word for it um I'm not even going to

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,220
touch facebook on this but I'm going to

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:54,910
get back to github because github kind

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,680
of does things okay I mean that's my

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,350
profile and there's this wonderful

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,850
little green chart and my wonderful

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,040
little green chart says that I do a

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,810
whole lot of commits but then there's a

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,520
private chart that you can't see that

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,930
only I can see so if I click between

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,430
them you can see the fact that I'm doing

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,050
a whole lot of stuff behind the scenes

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,690
that you'd never know about because

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,660
they're all in private repos on top of

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,070
that there's this little conditional

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,590
thing that no one actually clicks to say

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,500
what actually goes into their graph so

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,050
what actually counts on the graph it's

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,960
actually really weird because it's all

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,340
your commutes issues and pull requests

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,050
in the last year but that makes sense

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,560
because it's a statically defined with

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,750
12 months but it's only commits that

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,280
going to master or github pages so get

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,350
her pages of the documentation side

00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,170
where all your juggle things go so that

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,180
kind of makes sense but it's only issues

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,210
that you've opened or pull requests that

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,440
you've opened and your github email has

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,670
to match you get all four email because

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,910
that's how they match it up behind the

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,620
scenes plus you either have to own the

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,960
repo you have to be a collaborator you

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,090
have to be part of the ogre order the

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,710
owner organization you have to have

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,380
forked it opened an issue open to pull

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,810
requests or stab the repo so in order

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,040
for your issue to be accepted you have

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,290
to have open the issue

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,690
or you've had to have starred the repo

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,130
and open issue say some of the Venn

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,070
diagram of this thing I didn't even want

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,589
to try to document but only a little bit

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,889
counts of what you actually do that gets

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,870
in that little graph but it's just too

00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:30,110
high how can you make that rough

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,579
actually reflect what you're doing it's

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,990
okay because there's a hack for that

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,360
because all you have to do is just peep

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,870
and store rockstar and what that will

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,500
too it's for many days as you have it

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,449
will create a hello world in C++

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:51,019
backdated fit how many days and then you

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:52,519
get a nice full graph and the

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,190
documentation for this is awesome

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,860
because they have some tweets from life

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:02,149
at Google saying oh wow you know C++ we

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:04,160
will hire you because of the fact they

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,500
didn't get you can backdate commits and

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,120
you can just commit things into dodgy

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,949
repos and then you can just fill the

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,690
graph but you don't even have to do it

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:15,410
on your graph you can just use things

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,839
like this which dynamically generates

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,209
whatever you want and then you can spell

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,860
out cool words and github have never

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,420
ever endorsed this system will made any

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,310
money based on the fact that you can

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,839
change the graphs because that t-shirt

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:33,440
is something they used to sell and it

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:35,360
says github sure that's through you as a

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,190
person but what about your projects so

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,230
some people might recognize this project

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,579
it's on github most of the interactions

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,180
go through github so it's a really good

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:46,010
source of information that I can look at

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:50,899
so it says that there are 350

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:54,079
contributors to this repo except when

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,000
you click that it only shows 100 of them

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,620
and it shows them based on their

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,050
frequency and stuff and that's kind of

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,980
cool there's graphs and stuff but it's

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:06,160
just you set up 350 on one slide and now

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,540
it's a hundred where'd everyone else go

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,370
so what about all the issues that were

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,350
raised against requests what about all

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,750
the unmerged pull requests what about

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,029
all the comments the code reviews

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,939
anything that's not actually a commit

00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:21,350
that sin master against the repo if

00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,670
they're not part of the organization all

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,010
those other things i listed what about

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,600
all of them

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,190
can we get this information how to get

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:33,950
help they have an API I about a week ago

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,970
I thought yeah this can't be too hard so

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:40,190
i made a thing in python and you can

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,680
actually install the fire pit which is

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,270
really cool because I don't do Python

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,520
and I made a thing and it's all pi phi

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,370
in school so what you can do is you can

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,160
pip install octo hat so because they got

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,690
the octo cat it's octo hat because hat

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,790
racks and i thought it was a cool name

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,070
and no one else it used it so what you

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,080
can do is you can get this thing to

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,240
crawl through the API and work to work

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,950
out how many co contributors there are

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,170
and that's just based on who's actually

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,970
god master commits but then it goes

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,559
through every single issue every single

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,630
pull request and all the code comments

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,839
and works out who of those people

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,600
haven't also got commits and it turns

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:21,829
out there's 1200 of these people who

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,500
have interacted given contrib reviews

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,030
blogged issues raised pr's that haven't

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,829
been merged all these other interactions

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,800
and they have absolutely no

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:33,140
acknowledgement and this is the kind of

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,230
thing if you run a if you run a project

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,340
on github run this tool it'll output

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,170
actually a whole list of all the people

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,000
and these are the people that should be

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,700
thanking you should be trying to get

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,559
them involved more they've probably load

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,179
issues or done code review so they might

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,100
actually be able to contribute code and

00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,590
this is a really good way to get all

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,630
those people acknowledged identified and

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,950
try to bring them into your community

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,160
more because at the moment they're

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,450
getting absolutely nothing and as a bit

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,710
of a matter I actually checked how many

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,530
people have actually commented on the

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,540
Rockstar stuff when I originally ran

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,910
this it was about one code contributor

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,290
and 30-yard non Co contributors but

00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,380
that's because they almost like had

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,940
gifts unfortunately there's no natural

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,510
language processing or anything behind

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,190
there however plus ones to an issue do

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,800
actually count for something so I'm just

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,540
leaving it alone for now and if I want

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,160
to go really matter of the actual code

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,440
for this itself has got one co

00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,580
contributor me and one non-code

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,260
contributor which is nick who actually

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,970
helped me out with the packaging side of

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,410
it so now it's actually on pip so

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,160
another round of applause for people

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,160
being awesome

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,130
and because I'm really really really

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,960
matter here's a list of all the non code

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,020
contributors to mine on code contributed

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,300
talk all these people have been

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,090
completely influential and awesome and

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,410
all the things and I how much time do I

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,290
have left can I go through each of them

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,820
and make them really embarrassed ten

00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,310
minutes I can take 10 minutes worth of

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,890
questions or I can go through exactly

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,600
why all these people are awesome or what

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,520
i can do is i can stand here and wait

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,850
until i get at least 10 hashtags on that

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,220
thing um just there's nothing wrong with

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,720
being nice thank people be awesome

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,840
Twitter's not for age all the things and

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,840
thank you

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,110
my goodness the first question being

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:36,100
from Russell what a surprise my goodness

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,990
hello no um okay so great talk thank you

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,330
very much and I suppose the question

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,919
I've got is about what acknowledgement

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,529
actually made back in the early days of

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,899
Django we were on subversion and one of

00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:49,570
the things that really impressed me as a

00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,010
project and we adopted basically you

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,990
know systematically everything was done

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,190
is that subversion you know it was the

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,240
court committers who were committing in

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,549
the commits were all under their names

00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,679
but if the commits kept the patch came

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:01,330
from someone we would say thanks to John

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,350
Smith for the patch short thanks to Jane

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:07,450
whatever and that was a really small

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,039
thing but it felt really great to me

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,240
when I received that from the core

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,590
contributor and then I became a core

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,260
contributor and started passing it on to

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,539
whoever made the change we've moved to

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,149
get and we've kind of lost that because

00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,380
oh it's just in the git log you know you

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,840
can find out who contributed it because

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,580
it's just merging from the gate lock but

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,929
it's not as visible it's not like in

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,429
your face if you're watching the commits

00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,470
and even then it was Steven it was just

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,120
in the svn log it wasn't like up on a

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,710
website somewhere where you could point

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,110
and say hey look at this what does what

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,679
does acknowledge minus click beyond a

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:44,559
hashtag in a tweet well that's the thing

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,600
because I've actually well for starters

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,580
the fact that you were able to be

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,669
coerced from a thank you into a core

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,440
contributor is actually really cool and

00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:55,510
that's the kind of upscaling process

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,190
that they were probably after because

00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,020
it's like hey you did a thing would you

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:04,480
like to do more things I believe the

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:06,730
term is gang voluntold um but I've been

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,029
involved in open-source things where

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,799
I've had to add myself to the changelog

00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,240
and actually have a link to my thing so

00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,159
all the changes that would come in in

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,789
the next release were listed there's

00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:21,520
also contributing i believe is like the

00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:23,950
it automatically gets linked when you

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,720
try to do a pull request in github that

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,909
there are guidelines for contributing

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,880
but there's also contributors all in

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:33,190
caps but apart from that there's really

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,370
no computer mechanism so even

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,040
a thing like emailing people like if if

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,080
people talk at your meetups you should

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,910
thank them because it's really hard to

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,620
be on stage and it's really nice when

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,730
you get emails from people saying hey

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,620
you're also do you want to do another

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,680
talk cuz it's this whole coalition thing

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,740
um but I really don't have an answer for

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,220
that apart from is nothing wrong with

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,480
being nice to people but I mean

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,260
anything's better than nothing anything

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,340
is better than nothing and I mean I've

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,780
got this little thing where I could

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,430
actually go I want to thank the academy

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,950
for all these people that have helped me

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,920
be here and my mum and I could do that

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,410
but I'm not going too much um but it's

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,230
just it maybe takia maybe a bit weird

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,690
but it's like why does it have to be

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,300
weird to thank someone and I don't

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,280
really have an answer I'm sorry but hey

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,450
thank you very much and and you're

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:32,290
awesome as well thank you very much

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:34,150
during the talk so we've still got a bit

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,700
of time for questions and we're up to

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:41,260
eight Twitter posts on that hashtag I

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,850
need two more posts please waiter they

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:48,160
posts are actually nice things or people

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:50,260
trolling on the hey thank you for this

00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,610
talk I'm i've been following the Debian

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,160
project for some time and there's been a

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,080
conversation about how there could only

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,690
be developers they called developers who

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,000
are some of them develop a software for

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,690
Debian some of them package it but have

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,220
how the developer give you the

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,870
developers either give you the vote and

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,250
there were many people who could work

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,990
but weren't technical and didn't have

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,970
the vote and that's been a discussion

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,850
that it has been advanced to give the

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,710
vote to people who aren't technical

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,910
enough to actually package things and

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,610
put them in the main rivers for

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,590
everything to download I'd like you

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,570
probably know which other projects are

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,720
taking the same steps to give in

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,150
citizenship rights to vote in general

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,580
resolutions about projects you know in

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,500
the governance to people who aren't very

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,570
technical programmers who can you know

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,580
commit to the main wrapper well I know

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,910
that openstax a really good example of

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,680
that I'm not actually involved in any of

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,060
the bigger mana liftings that actually

00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,520
require

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,990
packaging and entire committees to try

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,370
to do the thing because most of the

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,290
projects I'm involved with the only

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,700
people that can drive the direction are

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,410
the people involved in the github

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,760
organization itself that actually have

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:04,030
the rights to be able to do that stuff

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:07,210
so I mean the fact that debian has

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,890
monolithic issues it extends past just

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,420
the Voting Rights system i mean there's

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:15,280
this whole monolithic packaging issue as

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,590
well but sorry um I I really don't know

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,960
I mean I've only been doing open source

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,980
he stuff for like gosh not even two

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,010
years now so I I haven't touched on all

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,210
these kind of things I'm just like hey

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,440
here's the thing you should do the thing

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,790
and it's all github and it's on you and

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:37,920
Chinese so I'm sorry I don't have the

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:40,660
answer hi hi thank you for talking um

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,570
one thing I read about fairly recently

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,690
was concept of group currencies and I

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,820
just wonder whether there's a potential

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,310
the idea is that just like countries

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,500
nations can have currencies and that has

00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:57,010
some sort of imputed value you could

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,050
have organizations groups projects with

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,720
their own currency and even a basic

00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,840
income that goes to core contributors

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,880
and that that currency can be a method

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,980
among other things to vote towards

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,710
what's prioritized for the project and

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,620
so on in a way potentially of rewarding

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,210
people even if they're not coming on

00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,310
board as a core contributor is that you

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,230
can give them some currency that you

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,850
event as a core contributor and then

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,860
they can use that you know as a

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,720
surrogate for voting new features or

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,960
otherwise influencing the direction of

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,050
that entity whether it's a github entity

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,640
or it's a community group or a meetup

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,380
okay that's a really interesting idea

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,240
based on the currency thing though I

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,860
think I briefly touched on the fact that

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,250
I've been paid to help with docker

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,810
because I also got a bad documentation

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,340
thing in dabka committed upstream

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,080
something to do with new lines and I

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,100
read me but they actually gave me money

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:53,230
for that they gave me 1.29 prime X coins

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,300
of whatever cryptocurrency wasn't at the

00:25:53,230 --> 00:26:00,360
time

00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:03,240
that converted to for us cents but yeah

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,560
that actual currency tokens like I can

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,850
make one vote for a thing that's

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:12,840
actually a really interesting concept

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,460
thank you so on the projects that are

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,560
kind of more inclusive Ubuntu has got a

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,960
quite interesting governance structure

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,810
so they recognize aggressively

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,060
recognized non-code contributions but

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,710
they've split out their voting so they

00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,870
have voting on technical things requires

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,470
a technical contribution voting on the

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,840
larger social non-code specific things

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,870
it's not just socialize why I correct

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,300
myself you have to contribute to Livan

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,950
to and they have a committee structure

00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,450
where they assessed contributions in a

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,210
fairly holistic fashion that's been some

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,200
years involved in their process at the

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,510
top of it that's not the mike democratic

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,330
but it's still I think my kind of kind

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,370
of very large community doing it mm-hmm

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,350
democracy in my open source I mean gosh

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,270
but I mean OpenStack has a similar thing

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,630
cuz if I'm not mistaken you are one of

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:06,900
the Nova main people that was like a

00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,400

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,800
over predates me I'm on the technical

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,000
committee yes EDD opens Dec and so I'm

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,100
part of the government structure there

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,020
yeah yeah so i'm pretty sure that I got

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,970
an emails part of atc that involved a

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,710
