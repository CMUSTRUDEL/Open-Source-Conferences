Title: Software Carpentry - Expansion and Partnerships in 2015 by Nic Crouch
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	The Software Carpentry Foundation is an international volunteer organisation that teaches basic programming skills to researchers in science, engineering, medicine and other disciplines. Further, the foundation maintains a wealth of open-source, open-access teaching materials for a several programming related topics, including Python, the Unix shell, Git, SQL, R and Matlab. 

Lessons from Software Carpentry are usually delivered in the form of two day workshops. Taught by trained instructors, these workshops cover automation of repetitive tasks using the shell, building modular and testable programs using Python or R and using version control to build software in a collaborative and efficient manner. Furthermore, workshops may be expanded, covering topics such as SQL and the use of databases to reliably store and maintain data. Though of course it is impossible to train expert programmers in two days, Software Carpentry has had great success in teaching ‘just enough’ to researchers that they can then return to the lab with a strong foundation of skills to build from.

This presentation will focus on the major progress that has been made by Software Carpentry in Australia and worldwide since PyCon-Au 2014. In particular, the pool of Australian instructors has dramatically increased through the live training session held as part of the Research Bazaar conference held at Melbourne University in February. As such, the presentation will be somewhat meta – answering the question ‘What are the educational principles and techniques you should know before attempting to teach novice programmers?’ The Software Carpentry lesson content has also evolved in the last 12 months, with the lesson content expanding to such topics as the use of Pandas and the more effective use of the iPython Notebook to work with data and visualisation. These changes allow Software Carpentry to cater to a broader audience of researchers. There will also be some discussion of the Research Bazaar conference, which partnered with Software Carpentry this year to not only train instructors, but also run a series of other ‘basic skills’ workshops for researchers. Finally, there is an interesting sister organisation of Software Carpentry, known as Data Carpentry, which focuses on improving the way researchers work with and store their data. 



PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:18,380
all right good please give a warm

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:20,029
welcome to me so i don't think i will be

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,490
holding questions to the end of the

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:28,630
session how are we all right

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,550
so before I begin I recognize a few

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,940
faces in here how many of you guys have

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:41,379
heard of software carpentry before and

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:46,090
yeah yeah and who knows what type of

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:50,800
software carpentry does cool yeah

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:55,600
exactly and who's the software carpentry

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,760
instructor that's what I thought okay so

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,769
today I'm just going to go through a

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,900
little bit of what software carpentry is

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:05,049
and what we do what's happened in

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,650
Australia this year what you learn in

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:11,229
the instructor training course and as

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,060
well as what raspberries and how you can

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:14,830
get involved and then what software

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,960
carpentry is done worldwide and if I've

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,390
got time I'll talk about some

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,330
experimentation that we're doing across

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,000
the organization so what is software

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,119
carpentry software carpentry is a

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,640
not-for-profit organization and the goal

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,320
is to help scientists who have a little

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,170
bit of coding knowledge that's usually

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,460
self-taught consolidate their knowledge

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,490
through a formal training from

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,759
essentially the ground up so the first

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,530
workshop we taught was in 1998 was based

00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,369
off a paper written in nineteen ninety

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,070
six or so it sort of Trump trundled

00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:54,069
along a little bit it got to 2010 they

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,619
rebooted the organization and changed up

00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,079
the workshop format and then since then

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,450
it's been supported by Sloan the sloan

00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,859
Foundation and Mozilla and it's now its

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:08,050
own independent nonprofit so essentially

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:12,580
what we do is we hold two full day or

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:15,940
two full day workshops we have

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:19,720
instructors who have been trained in the

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,540
arts and magic of teaching or at least

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,840
been given an introduction to that and

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,630
we have a set curriculum with some

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,769
external bits around that so essentially

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:35,299
the core topics of the curriculum

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:39,829
automating things using the unix shell

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:43,340
so your your bash and you make I've seen

00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:47,389
make make an appearance but it's not

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:51,409
necessarily core structured programming

00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:54,049
in either Python are or MATLAB obviously

00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:57,170
here focuses on Python so I'll mostly

00:02:54,049 --> 00:03:01,760
talk about that and version control

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,950
using get or material I think subversion

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,989
is well if you if someone is

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:11,269
particularly inclined but mostly get or

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:14,000
mercurial so up to 2015 we had our first

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:17,750
workshop at in Australia and Macquarie

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,409
University in 2013 and then over 2013

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,049
2014 we had some 17 workshops across the

00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,389
country most of those were in Melbourne

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,989
a few of the East Coast one in Adelaide

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,879
one in Tasmania there's also new zealand

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,730
and i put it on that map at someone's

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:39,859
suggestions so I don't end up on world

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:41,689
maps without New Zealand calm but I

00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:44,389
don't know as much about the new zealand

00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:47,019
courses and I have to apologize to any

00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:51,379
news or lenders in the room for that in

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,900
2015 we've had 21 workshops this year

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,930
alone over three states including our

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,400
first in Perth and I've lost my

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,729
presenter view which is really not very

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,729
helpful

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,049
sorry guys

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,440
hey so 21 workshops compared to the 16

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,700
in the two years leading up to that

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,480
we've had our first instructor training

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,670
course on sure we've formed a

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,000
partnership with the rezidor the

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,820
research bizarre conference and I'm

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,490
informed reliably that we have the most

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,590
workshops per capita in quote the known

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:43,710
universe so let's take a look at the

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,120
instructor training course it's run over

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,060
three days of this one was run over

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,710
three days in February and it was a

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,010
prelude to the research bizarre

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,860
conference at Melbourne University we

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,900
had a guy called bill Mills from the

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,080
Mozilla software lab or Mozilla science

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,410
lab sorry come over and effectively run

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,020
a three-day workshop in again the arts

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,260
and crafts of of teaching software or

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,110
software development we've also got

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,120
Damien Irving who is essentially i'm

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,530
standing in place of damien today he

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,500
would normally do this talk he's done

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,510
this talk a couple years running and he

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,820
he's had a lot to do and if it in fact

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:28,590
otays practically run software carpentry

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,120
in this country so he was it was a big

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,940
part of organizing that and the res best

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,729
conference and effectively what we cover

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,840
and I won't list them all but I'll go

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,729
through some of the big ones so i'll

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,169
start with cognitive development and

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,540
concept mapping essentially this is

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,300
developing our training so that we match

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,800
the way that learners think and learners

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,810
learn so we do that by it's essentially

00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,880
it's a lot of preparation you go through

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,070
the content you're working over and you

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,370
break it into into chunks so that you

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,280
match how people how short term memory

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,960
works so we've all heard or hope most of

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,200
us have heard that you can essentially

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,729
only store seven items of knowledge in

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,930
your short-term memory at any given

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:22,919
point in time and we have to build build

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,389
our instruction such that we we match

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,099
that seven item limit

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,690
we can do that by by building our

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,840
concept maps and you can see an example

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:36,849
of a concept map up here you take lots

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,220
of different somewhat related items and

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:43,970
in your preparation you build how you

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,990
relate those for your learner's so that

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,500
they can hopefully build up those

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,169
relationships themselves one big thing

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,590
that we do sort of to help with that

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,120
chunky is live coding live coding is

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,060
really important when you're teaching

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,479
because it proves but it slows you down

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,330
so no one is is trying to catch up the

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,840
whole time and it also proves that

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,120
you're fallible because and it's come up

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,539
a few times yesterday and this morning

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
as well if people if your learner's

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,770
don't understand that you're fallible

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,259
then they will become discouraged when

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,930
they themselves fail so to see their

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:28,759
instructor every now and then stuff up

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,469
is really helpful for their learning we

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,099
also reinforce our concept through

00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:36,349
repetition peer instruction I'll brush

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,780
over the essentially I essentially the

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,389
idea is that on off all novices

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,560
misunderstand their learning at first

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,080
but everyone misunderstands it

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,190
differently and so the idea is that we

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,800
can then have them work together and as

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,900
a group to help each other with their

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,050
misunderstandings we don't use it a lot

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,190
we use it a little it's been proven

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,280
elsewhere to be a really fantastic

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:06,199
technique and we learn it I'm hoping to

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:09,919
use it more and finally we not finally

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:14,810
but the final one or cover is learning

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:18,050
to teach so the big part that we have

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:21,590
emphasized is preparation and I saw that

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:25,009
yesterday as well there's a lot of time

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:28,050
before the actual learning part where

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,419
you put into your lesson design

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,419
and I think they are you said yesterday

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,080
most of your time was spent developing

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,630
lessons in Python in your case in our

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,130
case it's sitting down going over the

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,169
lessons that have already been prepared

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,930
for us and are openly available on the

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,690
internet and breaking that down writing

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,410
notes etc etc so that we know how we're

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,480
going to build that lesson plan or how

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,600
we're going to introduce our learners to

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,700
those concepts and how they can then

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,060
build those relations at maps in their

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,769
own mind the other thing that we've done

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,190
and i'll certainly be doing with this

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:11,910
presentation is watching yourself teach

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,459
on video it's a really horrifying thing

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,079
to do at the time I hate it I'm going to

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,550
watch this video I'm going to hate it

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,350
I'm going to hate that I just looked at

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,730
the camera like that I'm going to hate

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,980
that I've spent so much time talking

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,500
about this but at the same time it helps

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,649
me learn and by learning to be a better

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,120
teacher I can then teach my teach my

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,070
learner's more effectively I'll hate

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:39,839
that too so rez bez I said earlier res

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,520
bars was the conference that we had a we

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
had our training session in preparation

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,600
for the reason we had a training session

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,970
leading straight into the conference was

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,690
because the conference had a huge amount

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,180
of workshops on and effectively what res

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,100
basis is and I'm going to quote here

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,810
it's a community of researchers who

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,390
believe in open reproducible research

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,029
and so the role that software carpentry

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:06,089
plays in that is that we can help using

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,990
it using structured programming methods

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,070
we can help scientists learn to do

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,800
reproducible and open research and

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,810
especially with get and and source

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,779
control in general we can help them

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:22,459
build collaborative open reproducible

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:26,579
research so there were there essentially

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,829
six major topics at res bears the first

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:31,980
was r and python or the first two were

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:36,149
are in python we also had matlab and the

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,070
natural language toolkit and then we had

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,480
sort of some some different ones not so

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,320
programming ones in

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,410
in mapping and computer-aided design and

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,410
I know they had a workshop that was in a

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,370
workshop using 3d printers and our

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:55,199
cutters and all sorts of cool stuff in

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,029
2016 they're taking it outside of them

00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,529
taking it outside of Melbourne but

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,899
they're they're broadening it across the

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,120
world and this is really impressive this

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,940
2015 was the first year they've ever

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,560
done this conference in 2016 it's going

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,779
to be conducted in eight sites in

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,250
Australia and New Zealand two sites in

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,930
the USA and two in in the UK which is

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,430
really fantastic given that it's an idea

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:22,079
that came out of out of Melbourne

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:24,029
University and you know it's it's it's

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,589
growing really quite rapidly and that's

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,990
that's good because it's a it's a

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,149
fantastic sort of an idea it's one that

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,540
software carpentry is is really happy I

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:37,410
think to be part of so software

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,639
carpentry in in the world there are four

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,050
big things that have happened this year

00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,990
the first one I sort of mentioned

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:46,639
earlier software karma tree is spun out

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:50,160
and its own non-profit foundation now

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,550
we've set up a concept called data

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,899
carpentry we've expanded the curriculum

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,940
or we're working on expanding the

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,139
curriculum and we're working on

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,240
publishing our lessons so the software

00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:07,470
carpentry foundation is now a u.s. a

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,790
501c3 nonprofit so you know donations

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,649
are tax-deductible that's really cool

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,589
and it coordinates the development of

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,360
their core software carpentry lessons it

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,790
holds the IP rights the trademarks all

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,199
of that I guess administrative stuff

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,139
that helps everyone else in the

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:25,949
organization do their jobs and teach

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,870
people individual memberships are

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:31,800
effectively determined by contribution

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:35,819
so by giving two lessons in any 12-month

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,680
period or doing other contributions to

00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:39,980
the organization the board effectively

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,420
determines you are a member

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,449
organizational members done by a

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,040
subscription so any money that the

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,769
software carpentry takes in is

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,740
effectively used to further our lesson

00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,750
development

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:58,450
and hopefully do some cheaper or free

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,830
lessons for nonprofits and other

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,230
organizations that may be otherwise

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,560
wouldn't be able to afford it and

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,029
they're currently hiring so we're

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,220
looking for an executive director of

00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:13,620
software carpentry the it doesn't say

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,450
you have to be anywhere in particular

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,730
that the job description says you can be

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,320
anywhere in the world and do this job I

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,000
think it's really exciting because it

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,470
means we've got to a certain point in

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,899
the development of the organization so

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,339
data carpentry data carpentry is a

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,850
sister organization now software

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:37,330
carpentry it teaches basic concepts

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,459
skills and tools for working with with

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,140
data and that's that's for scientists

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,060
who maybe don't have any programming

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,390
experience at all so they start with

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,029
spreadsheets and they move up from there

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,800
you and it's good spreadsheets are good

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,080
because you can then teach the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,050
limitations of spreadsheets and this is

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,810
why you should use Python or are rather

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,670
than state is sticking with spreadsheets

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,670
and people who discover spreadsheets on

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,190
their own generally tend to pay now I've

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,810
got everything I want and they never

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,990
move on to something that's more open

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,279
and more collaborative the difference

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,579
between software carpentry and datacom

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:19,209
carpentry is exactly that scientists

00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,709
through a self-taught and have you used

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,270
programming a little bit belong in

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,459
software and software carpentry for the

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,579
most part those who have not done much

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,440
at all belong with data carpentry

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,120
probably that's not to say that software

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,310
carpentry can't help someone who's never

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,730
touched programming but there's sort of

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,060
what we're aiming the two at how am i

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,060
doing for time

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:48,460
10-15 minutes cool all right so there's

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:54,100
been a reasonably major adjustment of

00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:56,290
the lesson formats coming it's not there

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,930
yet there's a there's a discussion

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,150
around how we how we format our lessons

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:07,000
so for those of you who aren't familiar

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:09,820
at all with software carpentry the way

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,790
it works is we have a get up and on

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:16,690
github all of our lessons so that's

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:22,540
everything from our Python and and the

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:24,280
shell and and not just beginner stuff

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,580
there's some intermediate stuff on there

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,290
as well in Python we're rapidly

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,420
expanding that so there's there's no

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:36,760
material on pandas there's material on

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,490
modularizing your code there's material

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,840
on defensive programming and there's

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,310
some stuff in there on parallel

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:49,420
programming as well so that's that's

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,370
open to anyone to use and what we're

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,020
doing is obviously looking to expand

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,120
that but also we're looking to change

00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,920
change the way and I and I have to admit

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,070
I'm not a hundred percent clear on what

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,840
the what the end goal is but we're we're

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,420
working on changing the formatting of it

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,830
all so that it makes more sense to both

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,830
the people who are going through it by

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:14,500
themselves and for instructors who who

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:19,070
are working on understanding it and

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,290
breaking it down like I said preparing

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,340
and yet one of the biggest things is

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,990
that we're now introducing these

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:34,880
intermediate tracks which is which is

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:39,200
really cool um lesson publication lesson

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,910
publication is sounds how do I go about

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,020
this essentially what listen publication

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:48,680
means is we were assigning do I numbers

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,120
to all of our lessons and then they main

00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,370
contributors to those lessons or the

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,860
editors of those lessons get listed as

00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:01,130
an editor on the DI record do I record

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:04,720
and at that point they those lessons can

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:07,880
be cited appropriately so in academia

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,940
especially those those contributors who

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,850
are academics now have those those

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:18,199
lessons or will have very shortly those

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,360
lessons listed as papers that can be

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,760
cited and that go onto their their

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,850
academic record which is which is really

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:30,580
cool and and give some credit to our to

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:33,770
our editors who really deserve it and

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:38,660
finally we're not finally I'm going to

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:40,160
go back a bit but there are two big bits

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,130
of experimentation that we've done this

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
year once once maybe coming off one

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,930
hasn't the one that hasn't come off

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,620
these corporate workshops so I I'm not

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,840
an academic and I'm not the only

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,380
instructor in software carpentry that's

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,070
not an academic most are I'm some art

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,450
and what we've looked at doing is

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:10,310
workshops for the corporate corporate

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:14,330
sphere we said okay it's not what we

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:18,200
generally do but we'll try it and we

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:23,060
piloted I think 32 for corporate

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,090
workshops and they didn't work so what

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,010
we're

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,450
we're essentially saying this there's

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,059
lots of other people in the corporate

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,490
space that do training and we're

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,799
focusing on the academic scientists fear

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:38,789
for now the other one is remote

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,850
instruction and essentially that means

00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:45,360
we can what we have is a problem where

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:48,049
our instructors tend to be localized to

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,529
in Australia the East Coast for example

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:56,610
and worldwide a few of the few you know

00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:58,710
us you UK and Australia there are

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,559
obviously some spread throughout Europe

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:06,149
but there's an instructor's mailing list

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,740
and all the time we get we get workshops

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:11,580
that come up that say hey we need an

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:14,580
instructor in country we're willing to

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,549
fly you from you know anywhere in the US

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:20,220
to to this to this place and it gets

00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,500
quite expensive quite quickly and so

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,929
what we're experimenting with is remote

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:31,049
instruction it's a little early to say

00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:34,350
whether or it's worked yet that's that's

00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:36,779
all the material that I have prepared

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,029
straight off the bat I do have more on

00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,500
on what we learn in instructor training

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:44,340
sessions so I'll go back to that but

00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:48,390
first I just want to point out that you

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,970
guys can actually help and there's

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,250
instructors in the room they know but

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,140
there are instructor instructor training

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,750
sessions coming up and I've got those on

00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,309
the next slide you can contribute to the

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,520
lessons like I said they're all on

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:04,590
github and you're more than welcome to

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,110
submit pull requests to those lessons

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,049
and one of the big things and I'm going

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:13,020
to cover it before i get a question

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:17,220
about it is all of our lessons are for

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:20,159
Python 2 and the reason for that is that

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,390
until very recently we made the

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,820
determination that that most scientific

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,929
libraries weren't or weren't available

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,450
for Python 3 yet and so we would stick

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:36,780
to teaching what we knew worked we've

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,110
very recently in the last three months I

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,010
think

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:43,830
the issue came up on github said we're

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,960
ready now we think Python 3 has been

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,080
ready for a while we can start teaching

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,080
this to scientists because the the

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,510
material is all is all there so one of

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,380
the big things that's happening now is

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,840
we're converting our lessons to Python 3

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,980
that's still going so a really easy

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
first problem for someone is to go

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,320
through lessons or the Python lessons

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:11,480
and convert code it's little things it's

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:16,380
print statements for example to Python 3

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:19,190
now instructor training again sort of in

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,049
preparation for big red birds this year

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:26,250
we have we have live instructor training

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:28,260
coming up and obviously on the slides

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:34,290
we've got Brisbane Melbourne and and in

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:37,530
Auckland that's really exciting I did

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,360
know but don't remember sorry who's

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,160
coming over but we've got international

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:48,870
instructors coming in to teach those

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:50,400
which is really kind of cool so in terms

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,690
of some takeaways from today and like I

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,880
said I'm going to go back and talk a

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,990
little bit more about what we what we

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,030
learned it in instructor training

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,710
because that was my you've talked to

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,850
quickly and now you need to make up some

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,470
time thing but essentially there are a

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,600
couple key takeaways the first one is

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:11,610
software carpentry is getting really big

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,230
now and you know we've we've doubled the

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,000
amount of lessons that we've we've been

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,410
able to offer a big part of that is

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,600
because we've now got way more

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:22,980
instructors in the country out of

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,070
februari and we would really like more

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:30,270
so we can continue to build build what

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:35,400
we're doing so on that note you you too

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:36,780
you too can be an instructor you know

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,070
the instructor training course is really

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:45,150
valuable by itself and and actually

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,260
instructing I'm informed is really quite

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,870
valuable

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,690
a valuable experience in it and it looks

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,900
really really good on a on a resume for

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,000
anyone who's coming out of uni and it's

00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,010
a really enjoyable process for anyone

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,950
who's who's in academic or professional

00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,700
work the other thing is that res bez is

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:08,400
awesome and res bazi is awesome it's

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,700
it's fun it's exciting it's getting

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,450
really it's growing amazingly in 12

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,240
months or less than 12 months six months

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,400
and if you're at an educational or if

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,370
you're at a university you too can have

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,960
a res bars because they've they're

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,350
essentially giving the materials to

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,700
anyone who or not to anyone but if

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,850
you're the first person in the city who

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,450
can get institutional backing behind a

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:40,430
res bears conference in your city where

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,480
the conference organizers are really

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:47,450
really going to get behind that and help

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,450
you out so going back a little bit

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,650
so I've been through cognitive

00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:59,080
development and content mapping and that

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:02,380
that to me is one of the most important

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,039
things actually what I might do have I

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,039
got five minutes

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,610
where is it

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,640
alright so this is the the lessons that

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:53,120
are up on software carpentry

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,230
and you can see here we've got

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,730
programming with Python program with our

00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:02,820
program with matlab which is really cool

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:05,600
and what they come with is the repose

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,600
which is awesome

00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:08,979
so itself

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:17,280
so this is what the programming with

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,640
Python lessons look like and essentially

00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:26,280
the the introductory one you go through

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,930
introductory data analysis in it's an

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:33,060
information data set that's as good as

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:34,830
any other um and what we have as well as

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,250
an instructor's guy and it's not

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,850
complete it's not I think it actually

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,860
offers some real some real value in

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,960
terms of especially you guys for the

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:52,620
instructors I think we all need to jump

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:55,850
on here and and add notes as we go so we

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,850
have these instructors programs

00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:58,989
and

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:07,390
also the github so this is where the

00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:10,500
software carpentry github lives we've

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,500
got make lessons

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:19,400
and and it's all Martin see if i can

00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,400
find the okay numpy lesson sure why not

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,010
it's all muck done and you can go ahead

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,930
and edit that make pull request and if

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,760
the maintainer think it's available pull

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:36,280
request then of course they'll now it

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:41,690
themselves I'm I think I'm probably

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,280
probably done talking about software

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,670
carpentry for now unless you guys have

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,170
got any questions have any questions for

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,170
me wait a second on coming over

00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,300
mentioned that the private sector was a

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,860
failure what happened why that's a

00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:09,830
really good question essentially the oh

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,810
and I spoke to greg greg wilson about

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:15,110
this girl or since the current exec

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:19,400
director and the idea that i got was

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:22,670
that it was it was because this

00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:27,680
competition in that space as a

00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:30,500
not-for-profit it's not what we what we

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,130
aimed our lessons out and it's and it's

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,590
not it's not something that we that we

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,380
needed to get into there's other people

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,900
doing that they aim their lessons at the

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,930
corporate sector and you know they make

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,330
money doing that whereas we're not

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:50,510
looking to make money doing that except

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:53,150
to support our other efforts and you

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,440
know with a lesson material and and all

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,360
of our instructors or most of our

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,570
instructors I've come from the academic

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,220
background so there's no real there's

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,220
another huge motivator there either so

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:11,470
do you charge participants to attend a

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:13,289
workshop ah yes so the way it works is

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,299
there's a reasonably nominal

00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:19,659
administration fee and the way I've

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:21,539
heard of it working in both ways so you

00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:24,039
can either have the organization pays

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:27,730
pays it all up front and then people

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:30,970
people go for free or you charge each

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,330
person I think it's roughly and we have

00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:36,130
forty dollars a person give or take a

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,490
little bit more so it's it's not much

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,470
for a two-day training course and the

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,710
thing that we found that getting people

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,570
to pay does is it makes them rock up

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,149
otherwise you get it I think there's

00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,130
there's some numbers around thirty

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,100
percent drop out if you don't have them

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,850
pay whereas five percent I think if you

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,850
if you haven't paid

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,130
I'm a primary school teacher teaching

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,870
computer programming would it be worth

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,670
my while coming along to a session like

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:13,840
this to learn how to teach

00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:17,710
by then I guess Python yeah sure um yes

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:21,880
is the very short answer yes is yes is

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:23,560
the short answer I I learned a lot I'm

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,550
not I don't have an educational

00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:30,310
background but a lot of what they teach

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,620
is not just the the pedagogy of it all

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,220
but which which you would have training

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,670
in obviously but how it applies then to

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,640
to the coding which is and that's why

00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,200
it's wise available thing whether or not

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,820
you know if you're a teacher it's

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,260
valuable because of that bit if you're a

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,630
coder it's valuable because you get the

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:55,180
pedagogy of it all okay yeah sorry what

00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,680
kind of expectation how much knowledge

00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,060
were in need of Python or something like

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,580
that or could I come in with very

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,830
beginners very big in a very beginner

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,560
one of the things that we had emphasized

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,420
is that you don't actually need to know

00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,910
a whole lot more about what you're

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,910
teaching then then what you're teaching

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,410
because one in our particular case

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,470
because we have the lesson materials

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,790
there so if you understand the lesson

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,380
materials and you've gone through that

00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,900
and you've read through them then you

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,170
understand enough to teach what you what

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,200
you're trying to teach but the other

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:34,270
thing is I've forgotten where is going

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,770
to go with that sorry effectively yet

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,070
because we have the lesson materials and

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,500
you've broken that down first you know

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,559
everything you need to know any further

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,920
questions

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:49,100
and sir

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:52,150
now I'd like you all to give Nick a huge

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,150
round of applause

00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:03,610
