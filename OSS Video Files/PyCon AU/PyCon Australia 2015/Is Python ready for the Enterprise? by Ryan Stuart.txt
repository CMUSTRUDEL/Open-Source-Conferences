Title: Is Python ready for the Enterprise? by Ryan Stuart
Publication date: 2015-08-04
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015
Description: 
	There seems to be an opinion among some developers that Python isn't suitable for Enterprise. To put it another way, Python is great for small tasks where a scripting language works well, but not so suitable for more complicated software stacks. This talk tries to address some of these concerns. Specifically, we will look at:

* Python Typing System for large code bases.
* Is the GIL a problem?
* The speed of Python execution.
* The speed of Python development.
* A case study: Caterpillar.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
