Description: 
	Wagtail is a new CMS built for Django. Making sites in it is easy once you know Django. To prove it, I will recreate the Pycon 2015 site as you watch. Live coding - nothing can go wrong!

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

hello excellent cool so it's actually

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,480
under 20 minutes so I may not fit

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,489
everything so let's get started I am Tim

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,700
hey power there's all my links if you

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,620
want to stalk me I work for take flight

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,629
where a robot based web development

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,480
company we specialize in wagtail but we

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:46,720
did not build it wagtail is made by a

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,460
company called torch box from the UK

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,350
it's a CMS that's built on Django its

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,610
first release was 2014 so it's fairly

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,280
new they built it for a particular

00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,470
client and open sourced it has just had

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:06,350
its 1.0 release so that we're down nice

00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:08,149
big everything so it's now ready for

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,970
everybody to use in their opinion and

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:14,570
it's shaping up very nicely and you can

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,250
check it out at their website if you

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,930
want to demo of any wagtail sites

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,640
there's a lovely site called made with

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,020
wagtail that demonstrates everything

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,690
that's made with wagtail made by a group

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,179
in new zealand who also go off wagtail

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,160
they're a good bunch and it itself is

00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:32,600
made in wagtail and is open source so

00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,970
you can go check that out if you want a

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,950
good example but I'm gonna stop my

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,599
slides here shortly because I'm gonna do

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,270
some live coding and actually build

00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,880
something so let's get to it

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,530
and I have the Python web site here this

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,830
is the actual live web site that I'll be

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:54,470
trying to duplicate and have over here

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:57,050
on my code so yeah sorry if you can't

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,190
read it down the back I tried to make my

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,160
fondest because it goes but if it goes

00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,360
any bigger than it stopped working so

00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,940
come any closer if you can't greet it

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:11,569
sorry so much like Django it has a start

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,550
project command and that will get you

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:17,180
started with a wagtail project I'm

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,860
making a Pike on a your project that's

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,190
starting with a fairly standard Django

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,190
setup

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,350
so whacked out is it's just a django

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,780
application that you can stall like

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,280
install like any other module it's it's

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,620
besides Django and compliments if it

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,210
doesn't try and overtake it you can so

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:47,710
it plays nicely with all that just the

00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:54,300
end of Django functionality very secure

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:54,300
password if I go here

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:07,050
we should periodically have our whack

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:10,080
tile server starts off fairly bland and

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,420
ordinary as it expect it's that sets it

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,010
up at the default site and that's about

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,510
all you get out of the box everything

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,090
else is up to us so we'll be building

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,000
that over the course of this talk you

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,910
can log in at slash admin by default it

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,710
comes with its own Django admin like

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,900
interface but it isn't the Django admin

00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:31,050
it doesn't theme it and try and build in

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,270
it just started afresh so on one hand

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,830
you get this attractive thing on the

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,420
other hand you don't have modern admin

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,490
interface you can get the Django admin

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,680
interface and sit it beside it that's

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,790
absolutely fine but we've found that we

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,710
don't actually the Django admin

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:52,410
interface anymore because this does

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:56,510
everything I'm still talking the Django

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,510
admin is not your app so this is good

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,020
this is the admin right now we haven't

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,880
actually got anything because I don't

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,980
have any page types so I will introduce

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,120
you more to this later but here it is

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,830
this is what it looks like

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:17,480
we'll get familiar with this over the

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:19,799
course of this talk again seems to keep

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,200
first things first I will actually make

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,090
a Content page first instead of the home

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,590
page because that's a lot simpler and

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,880
it'll give you a gentle introduction

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,800
before you start trying to do crazy

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,020
things with the actual home page because

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,680
that is a lot more involved so I will go

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,680
ahead and do that

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,480
so all the way to our page types are all

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,480
standard Django models

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,190
they all descend from the core page type

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:04,910
that's a model that's provided by Jango

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,950
oh that's like by wagtail about

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,520
everything else is up to you so from

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:17,620
Jango DB important models for everything

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:23,480
else you need and they also provide a

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,800
rich text field and that will provide

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,720
you busy week functionality so they

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,240
integrate with the hello UJS edited by

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,700
default though there's some talk about

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,980
changing that out they also recently

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,750
introduced a feature called stream field

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,240
which sadly I don't have time to

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,950
investigate but is excellent and will

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,870
hopefully supersede rich text editors

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,610
completely investigate that in your own

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,610
time because it is well worth seeing

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,789
so I'll have to add this through the

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:10,450
like that so like any other Jiang

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,450
everything you'll have to

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:28,340
collaborations as you would expect dear

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,880
I've done something bad one second I

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,140
knew this would happen

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,140
why hurting never do it people

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,620
there we go I knew everything would

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,960
break so I am made made Babs sorry

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,979
everyone

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:31,069
never try and live code in the

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:31,069
presentation sorry where was I

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,569
let's go

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,229
cool server

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,229
yes

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,460
there we go sorry about that everyone so

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,080
I skipped a bunch of steps because I

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:34,410
broke everything sorry

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:38,460
so where are we let's go here so content

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:41,910
model that got made into the content

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,039
page I cheated a lot here so I actually

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,360
had the templates pre-prepared because

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,620
this isn't a talk about front-end

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,600
development or Django temple in this is

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,450
to talk about wagtail so I'll show you

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,010
the wagtail bits of this but basically I

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,500
went to the pike on a used site and

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,610
store all the HTML so you know hopefully

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,610
that wasn't copyrighted or anything

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,190
so this is the whack towel explore

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,280
interfaces they call it this lists all

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,810
your pages we have a single homepage

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,390
everything is a descendant of the home

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:31,400
page so inside here we have an about

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:33,260
page the about page by default pages

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,820
always have a title we've also added a

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,100
body field as part of our model

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,410
definition so you can see that here it's

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,210
a rich text field it is a rich text

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,860
field you can type whatever you want on

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,890
our model definition you'll also note a

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:52,580
content panels definition that is kind

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,770
of like your Django admin field sets

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,000
where you can declare what you want to

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,890
appear and in what order you want them

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,590
to appear so I've just appended the

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,090
field panel body to the page content

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:08,810
panels and that is appearing over here

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:11,660
so this out of the box you get drafts

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,350
you get publishing you get moderation

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:18,140
you get all the nice CMS features e14

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,730
very little work but we've got we've

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,630
already got everything here save that

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,640
it's there it works pages can also have

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,080
pages underneath them so underneath

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,810
about we've got the team and the venue

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,780
page much like the actual plaque on site

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,310
and you can see that here I've got that

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,560
over on the side I've got two links

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,240
these menus I did build myself through

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,850
some template tags if I have time I'll

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,900
go through them but that's something

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,980
that you have to build yourself but

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,440
because you build it yourself you have

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,380
complete freedom to build whatever you

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:57,590
want so I've also got the about page up

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:59,390
in the top menu I could expect so I'll

00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,760
move on to actually making the home page

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,420
now that I've shown you some of the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,420
features you can do

00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,160
so out of the box wagtail will make you

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,230
a homepage model because they have to

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,279
give you something to start with it has

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:23,880
absolutely nothing on it so we'll add

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,980
some stuff looking at the pike on site

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,570
I'm not gonna replicate the full

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,120
homepage because that is a huge task but

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,070
I'm gonna replicate some bits and pieces

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,810
of it as we go and it'll get more and

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,529
more driven from the database as opposed

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:42,450
to hard-coded so on this page I am going

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:44,100
to the title Tech yeah the background

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,800
image here if you will to look at the

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,180
HTML that's actually rendered multiple

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,329
times as an image so that it does

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,730
responsive images I'll handle that yeah

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:56,480
is a link to a registration page so will

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,430
link to a particular page in the actual

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,930
page hierarchy somewhere I will get to

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,610
doing all these sponsors through the

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,930
database and that'll all the sponsors

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,560
across the whole site will be handled

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:11,339
from the single sponsors table if I get

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,820
time I'll do the news as well but we'll

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,180
see how we go for that but very simply

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,180
first

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:41,070
so wank tail has a built-in image model

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,050
and some image resizing functionality

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,530
which we will use in the template

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,020
shortly

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:51,300
it defined as a foreign key to the

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:53,880
wagtail images model because pate how

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,440
pages work you you don't want your page

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,060
to be deleted when your image is deleted

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,140
so you have to also set some fields on

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,140
your foreign key so on

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:18,519
we also want the registrations here so

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:25,209
I'll add two things a registrations open

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:28,649
boolean they link to the page that we

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,649
want to go to with that button

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
same deal again you don't want your page

00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,880
to be deleted when you delete

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
registrations page because that would be

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,900
awkward and you'd be left without a home

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:48,180
page one could debate that without the

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,400
registrations page the PyCon website is

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,870
a little bit

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,970
no no longer useful but we don't want to

00:13:51,870 --> 00:14:00,930
disappear when you close the

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:03,210
registrations and finally there's a link

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:13,820
to where sponsors page as well so I'll

00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:13,820
include that with all the same options

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,730
again you set what fields you want in

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,110
the to display in the database you can

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,170
do some fairly fancy things here which

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,030
was I'll continue to do so some of these

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,590
fields are grouped together and so

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,540
should be grouped together in the admin

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,540
so I'll make that happen

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,920
I also said some defaults to keep the

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,920
migrations happy

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,230
tens caps lock on if you ever use them

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,090
just remove the caps lock key it'll

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,590
cause you no end of trouble but I don't

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:12,370
really want to deface my laptop so I

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,370
shan't so

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,370
oh yeah

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:39,070
my telling me just plural coke done

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:51,760
so if we go back to our way to our admin

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:53,230
we should now with any luck have much

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,240
more many more things that are in the

00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:00,550
homepage so we can go again to the PyCon

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,140
website and steal some text dump that in

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:11,140
there we can choose an image where am i

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm in documents talks

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:22,960
changuk on images ban out upload done

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,370
registrations are open the registration

00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,980
page I don't actually have one so I'll

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,660
just link to the about page and the

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,010
sponsors link same problem I'll just

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,780
link to the about page for now I'll add

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:36,190
them shortly if I don't run out of time

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:39,310
in five minutes if you go through the

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,530
homepage now it'll still be still hard

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,430
coded so let's edit some templates and

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:49,420
I'll show you some of the nice features

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:52,210
there page so first things first big ole

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:58,870
banner text the page is always

00:17:52,210 --> 00:18:01,180
referenced using the self variable so

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:06,450
our self top banner up so that it's not

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,450
banner image there yeah and I'll go

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,900
so wagtail comes with as I mentioned a

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,049
very nice image resizing library so here

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,070
I am resizing the banner image four

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:34,140
times for these four different

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,140
responsive image classes

00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:02,400
and then I will simply go in here and

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:08,280
replace these URLs with so if you wanted

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,750
to get with all the fancy new responsive

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,540
images stuff it would be very easy to

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,430
declare a django tag or django filter

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,990
that took an image produce some output

00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,160
in a standard way across the whole site

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,780
and then all of your sites

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,170
now just had responsive images

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,930
everywhere so this save you a lot of

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,990
time also just the header images for

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,000
those nice huge full-page backgrounds

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,420
that are very in vogue now this will

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,420
handle it

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,730
I'm gonna stop doing that because I am

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:49,669
running out of time hardly so you can

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,809
also do get the URL of any pages heap

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:57,830
linked to so self dot registration link

00:19:53,809 --> 00:20:01,220
dot URL just got a link to another page

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:04,630
and sponsors all the way past all these

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,630
sponsors same deal

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:15,130
now sadly that weren't actually look any

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,130
different forgot to impor something

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,460
and take a little while to resize all

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,870
the images done now this is all been

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,940
taken from the database the image is

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,980
being resized dynamic but not

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,360
dynamically risk you through your

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,040
templates through whatever size you want

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,630
we got the full sizes we have these

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,670
links to any pages that will follow the

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,170
links around have a nice sponsor link

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,330
everything's going excellently I'm

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,010
getting the time's running out signal

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:51,790
quite heavily right now so I'm going to

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:53,350
just go get to five yes so another

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,080
feature that is very very useful is

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,270
something called snippets so we will see

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,700
on the pike on site there is a sponsor's

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,770
here there is also sponsors on you

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,260
inside pages all on the side and there's

00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:09,220
actually a sponsors page as well all

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,690
these could theoretically be all this to

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,860
be driven from the same database table

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,320
and that's something that snippets does

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:19,780
for us so we are making a whole new

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,110
let's move past all that holding the

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,140
whole new map called sponsors we on the

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,290
sidebar we got rid of all the sponsors

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,330
hard-coded text and added aside sponsors

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:35,680
template tag we script passing

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,540
migrations there is a sponsors snippet

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,070
so snippets are these things that aren't

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,930
necessarily contained to a single page

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,250
we have made a sponsors model class

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,560
registered as a snippet through the

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:49,000
decorator it has a name a URL image and

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,730
description now with so guess where they

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,680
are level so all the sponsors had

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,030
different levels all this all these

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,980
various field types are completely

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,500
supported by the way tail admin again

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:05,260
find your field panels that escapes your

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,490
sponsors then to get the sponsors to

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,110
appear on the homepage we in this is on

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,480
the home page class sorry we get that we

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,770
over either get context method we put

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,790
some sponsors into the context of the

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,890
page so then when we go into the

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,720
template we can iterate over them we get

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,370
rid of all the hard-coded sponsors skip

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,820
past all that and we just iterate over

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,840
it

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:28,830
standard Django templates output the

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,830
HTML and done

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,450
six and

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,620
oh I broke everything

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:53,330
I'll may have to call there because

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:56,330
people looking at anxious what was next

00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:03,710
bit and through all this data we can

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:05,180
also make a sponsor's page so in the

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,330
sponsors module again I made a sponsor's

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:12,230
page the sponsors page is just like a

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,450
content page has content panels get

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,130
context sponsors again and that allows

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,630
me to make a whole page that I can add

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,950
into my through my admin panels that

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,630
just Liddy's the sponsors page you go

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,120
there it has all the sponsors it renders

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,040
them into the context through the driven

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,460
from the actual database all sponsors

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,370
that appear everywhere else on the side

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:37,030
has its own template your traits over

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:41,809
the sponsors the regrip tag which is

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:44,320
always a fun joy to use and that gets

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,320
you with

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,850
everything breaks cool

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,770
and that week everything in Healdsburg

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,780
No he's all broken cool and I think I'm

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:40,180
at a time sir that was a great

00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:42,430
conclusion so I thank you very much Tim

00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,420
um okay so one question you didn't sort

00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,220
of address here and it's probably

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,110
because the topic was about wagtail

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,960
specifically but how does wagtail shape

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,870
up against the other big ones in the in

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,800
the CMS space they're doing a CMS where

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,480
where are the strengths where are the

00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,000
weaknesses where is it where is it

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,680
better than others yeah so I haven't had

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,290
a lot of experience with those other

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,670
CMS's but my experience with some of

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,710
those and I won't name names because

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,960
I've forgotten which ones to name is

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,270
that they didn't necessarily integrate

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,040
nicely with Jango like they were their

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,660
own thing and you did mezzanine didn't

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,300
develop Jango you developed mezzanine

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,100
and if you wanted to integrate with a bi

00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,210
if you wanted to make your own Jango I

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,600
have to sit next to it such as the

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,090
registrations that Python website has it

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,770
wasn't fun it wasn't Pleasant you just

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,110
you spent most your time battling the

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,940
other CMS I have built multiple things

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,790
in wagtail that have other components

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,860
sitting next to them and it was as

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,370
simple as it should be it just worked

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,960
like it wagtail is a standard Jango app

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,720
it doesn't require you to jump through

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,180
its own hoops it it just plays nicely

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,740
with everything else it has a very nice

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,940
admin not all of these catch up with

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,040
their own admin they ship with a Django

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:55,780
admin which is not always friendly to

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,640
your content editors that's mostly it

00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:02,610
the back tail devs are very responsive

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:05,140
and you can contact them easily yeah I

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,040
think your answer answered my question

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,500
but to be specific have you taken an

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,620
existing django application that has

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,200
lots of apps you know and put wagtail

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,250
back in that from from the opposite

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
direction rather than starting with

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,540
wagtail and adding some django apps have

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,700
you taken an existing Django project and

00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,280
added wagtail to it and found what was

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,380
your experience doing that I haven't

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,230
done that

00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:35,600
so no sorry I can't help you there but

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:38,539
the sole point of contact really between

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
Django and the rest of your apps is the

00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:42,860
URL comm so you just add the Django the

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,799
wagtail admin to your comp whatever you

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,200
are all you want and you add the page

00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:51,110
routing URL route at the bottom of URL

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,059
list and that basically in creates

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,100
wagtail so as long as you don't try and

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:59,480
do anything really really weirdly fancy

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,799
with URLs then it should just work great

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,830
yeah because that was my experience with

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,570
trying mezzanine and Django CMS and

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,590
stuff was you really were fighting them

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,970
to try and integrate them into an

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,970
existing so but that sounds

00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:27,610
