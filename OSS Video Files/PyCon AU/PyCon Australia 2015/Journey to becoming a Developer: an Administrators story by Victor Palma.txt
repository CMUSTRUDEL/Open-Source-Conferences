Description: 
	As a system operator we sometimes have to create scripts to maintain our infrastructure.  However because of DevOps some of us have taken a path to move more towards a developer role.  That journey can be a bit tough specially if you don’t have the proper support in place.  Fortunately for me I had some help along the way and they gave me some direction that has improved my development.  Here is a list of small things to help you on that journey:
• Changing the way we think (mindset of a developer)
• Idiomatic python
• Zen of Python by example
• Testing
