Description: 
	pip has become an immensely popular tool for installing packages in Python, so much so that a bootstrap mechanism for it is now included in the standard library. But it has a dark side. Come and learn about some of the horrors that lurk within pip. Examples will include the distribute -] setuptools fork and convergence, dealing packages which attempt to use not-yet-installed dependencies, and the oh-man issue of resolving dependencies which pip still entirely punts on.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.
