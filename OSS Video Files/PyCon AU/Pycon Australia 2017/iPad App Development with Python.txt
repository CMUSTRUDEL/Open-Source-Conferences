all righty time to get started

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,150
um this is Chris Robinson he is a

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,349
digital technologies and maths teacher

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,030
at a before Park High School he um so

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,379
one of the problems that often comes up

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,869
when teaching Python to students is that

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,609
they just want to build apps it turns

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,769
out you can build apps in Python and I

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,420
am very excited to hear how Chris does

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,250
that some of his students have published

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,230
apps in the App Store so we'll find out

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,230
how he's done that thank you Chris

00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,939
[Applause]

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,420
good afternoon everyone my name is Chris

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,160
Robinson and I work at a before Park

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,350
High School in South Australia at the

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,149
moment I'm a digital technologies

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,590
teacher as well as a little bit of maths

00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,690
this is a bit of my school background I

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,960
work at a government school with around

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,840
1,100 students were an apple school and

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,260
our students have iPads from years eight

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,650
to ten and when I first arrived at the

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,930
school that posed some problems with

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,570
what was I going to do with them with

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,540
these iPads when the end goal was

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,150
actually having them write some code and

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,040
to do some programming

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,680
so I teach digital technologies unite in

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,180
the new ten and then I T eleven and

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,670
twelve and then we're transitioning

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,270
digitech into eleven and twelve over the

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,860
next couple of years so when I started

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,810
work at a PHS in 2014 I wasn't teaching

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,119
any IT at all I started off just

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,030
teaching maths even though I'm trained

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,930
in computer science the job was in maths

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,970
and that's how I got in so I decided to

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,520
start off this this small lunchtime

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,570
group it started off very small maybe

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,520
around 10 15 people and that was in 2014

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,939
when I was just teaching the maths and

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,009
one class of science and now the

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,599
lunchtime group has actually grown over

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,489
the years to a slightly bigger crowd and

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,440
it has a stronger folks focus on

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,920
application development

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,550
rather than just sort of text-based

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,220
programs and I didn't even think of

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,280
having apps on the store at the time and

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,629
then after I guess the first year I was

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,739
like yeah why can't they publish them

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:33,000
and had to learn quickly how to publish

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,230
an app on the store with the description

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,849
and all the icons and things so these

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,180
they took some of the reasons why I

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,010
think pythons are really good language I

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,709
think it's awesome as a first language

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,519
to start off with it's very easy for

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,920
them to learn and yeah you can start

00:02:50,519 --> 00:03:00,030
really easy but you can get to quite

00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,530
high levels which I love so like I said

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,750
before these are the subjects that I

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,579
teach at the moment you know in digital

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,640
creations you tend to do recreations

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:13,920
Stage one did you check next year and

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,380
then stage two in 2019 I guess my Python

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,600
group has extended into the actual into

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,780
the real classroom and I get to do some

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,690
of this work as a real subject which is

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,760
awesome so now over a semester my

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,609
students would spend either six or seven

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,489
weeks using Python to develop

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,930
applications for their iPads and the

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,160
thing I really like about it is they do

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,549
all the work on their device they can

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,760
code anywhere they like at home at

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,590
school all the documentation is in the

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,510
app and it's offline so they don't have

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,260
to have internet access for it to work

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,019
and yeah it's a full Python interpreter

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,780
built into the app and I like to show

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,310
them some foundation stuff whether it's

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,450
like me live coding on the screen or

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,769
whether they can just watch the YouTube

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,500
videos that's something that I've

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,970
started off this year and if you want to

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,639
have a look at my youtube channel you

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,859
just have to follow me on Twitter or go

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,010
onto my Twitter and go to the website

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:21,560
link so the

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,730
they work on these creations inside of

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,070
the classroom and outside of the

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,390
classroom and then some of them are

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,040
going to that to the point where they

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,320
can actually publish their app on the

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,390
store and some of them are just going to

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,550
sort of modify a little bit of what I've

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,570
done and extend them a little bit and

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,780
some people are going to build things

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,400
completely from scratch and some people

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:46,550
are gonna go further than that and do

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,110
crazy things with OpenGL shaders and put

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,580
lots of physics into their work and

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,960
things like that I like to spend the

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,900
classroom time that I've got with them

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,880
on challenges and collaboration because

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,440
I think that's more useful than the

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,270
mechanics of me doing some code and

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,360
showing them some stuff so that's why

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,400
I've started a YouTube channel so that

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,410
everyone can learn in their own time and

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm already finding that that's quite a

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,220
valuable resource for them and I'm just

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:25,790
on my way to get a hundred thousand

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:26,960
subscribers think about about 30 so I'd

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,570
like to tell you a little bit about the

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,760
app that I've used and why I chose it so

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,100
like I said when I started work at her

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,220
before Park high school we weren't doing

00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,080
any sort of code and I was thinking what

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,240
am I gonna do on these iPads we used to

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,730
using computers just done three years of

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,430
Java what am I gonna do them and so I

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:50,450
found I found pythonista

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,990
and I haven't haven't done Python before

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,280
and he learnt it in 2014 and I'm so glad

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,040
that I did because it's it's like

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,500
awesome but what I love about the

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,770
pythonista app is it has a full code

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,320
editor it used to run Python 2 and now

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,360
it runs Python 3 actually it runs both

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,880
and you can switch between whichever

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,830
interpreter you want to use and the

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,990
students find it really easy to get

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,590
started whether it's doing something

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,350
text-based or finding out how loops work

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,810
but quite often I like to start off with

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,000
graphics because they can see something

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,740
on the screen and it's not it doesn't

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,200
take a great level of skill to actually

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,979
put something on the screen get it

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,479
moving and then you can extend on that

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:38,810
one problem that I did find that the

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,080
students run into is indentation and not

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,970
getting their code indented probably so

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,770
I'm trying to find a way to best manage

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,210
that and yeah the that problem quite

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:56,180
often comes up when they try to mix

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:58,910
spaces and tabs together I'll quickly

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,979
explain what the students learn out of

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,039
doing this work with me and then I have

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,680
some student examples so the main thing

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,599
they learn is obviously problem solving

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,650
they learned a whole bunch of that

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,270
breaking down problems and coming up

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,090
with the solutions to their own problems

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,180
I think it's really cool that they come

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,460
up with their own problems rather than

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,590
me always giving them one I can do it in

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,090
the start but in the end I want them to

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,580
create their own problems and solve them

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,460
themselves they learn lots of coordinate

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,699
geometry so I used to teach math a lot

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,009
and it's very important and they're only

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:36,710
working in 2d space so some of them will

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:40,039
move on to 3d afterwards but most of my

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,810
students are just working in 2d so they

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,599
need to figure out the various positions

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:49,330
of the screen and and where to place the

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:53,240
items they learn how to create and use

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:56,180
objects subclasses callback methods

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,330
things like that I teach a lot of frame

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,610
by frame style animation so yeah you can

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,190
create an action object that does like

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,349
move to your put in the X&Y and how long

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,409
you want it to take but I would like to

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,520
show them how to do frame by frame

00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:13,330
animation so basically every frame

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,229
nudging a sprite node to make it move

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,180
then they can have a think about

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,180
changing the speed in different ways

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,130
like I said with actions I guess an

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,630
action is like an animation and they can

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:31,699
be the move to move by fade to fade by

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,860
and then you can apply them to the

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,360
individual things that are on the screen

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:39,050
so that's something they would move into

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,839
a little bit later they also learn how

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,480
to use discrete methods to handle touch

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,830
events like touch began and touch ended

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,980
and then

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,730
they'll also do the other method which

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,900
is touch moved which fires quite a lot

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:59,300
as long as you're moving your finger

00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:02,420
over the screen so these are the two

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,110
modules that the author of pythonista

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,440
has built into the app so the iPad

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,970
specific one of them is the UI module

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,380
and you can put in all of Apple's native

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,660
controls text boxes sliders buttons

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,940
switches all that sort of stuff

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:27,050
you've got view controllers you can make

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:29,780
and some of the students particularly

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,570
myu 12s have done they're their final

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,330
projects using the UI module the same

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,880
module is the one that I usually start

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,370
with and it's just based around a 2d

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,140
scene and you have sprite nodes which

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,910
are the objects and then you can have

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,280
some actions that are applied to those

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,870
objects and that's probably where I

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,540
start that's what all my videos are

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,090
pretty much based on and I find the

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,440
students really like it it's based on C

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:59,210
types and it's not quite a complete

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
wrapper and that's probably one of the

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,780
things that I like about it it doesn't

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,060
contain anyone that's done any other

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,480
Apple development it doesn't contain any

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:11,240
physical body objects so they can't just

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,820
make a physical body object that's let's

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,230
say like circular and have another thing

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,830
that's circular and have them collide

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,600
because they're rectangular so they

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,300
actually have to figure out some of

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,000
those mathematical and physics concepts

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,500
themselves and it enables the students

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,990
to practice and use their high-level

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:35,540
math skills such as you know distance

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:36,920
between two points and making yeah it

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:43,640
makes them implement their own physics

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,470
engine which you see in a minute so

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:52,090
these are what we've got published on

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,090
the store so far we have

00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,089
scape third law square blockade fan run

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:04,029
blockade runner and combo crush and if

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,680
you search up a PHS standing fair before

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,579
park high school you would find all of

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,170
them on the store so what happens with

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,910
the students and making these apps like

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,519
I said before they do all the work on

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,560
the iPads and then they eventually send

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,260
me their their finished work and then I

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,050
drag their Python file into the template

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,810
and then add on some icons and then

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:32,949
submit it to Apple for testing and then

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:35,399
it gets published so these are some of

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,120
the things that I'd like to show you

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,120
that my students have created

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,070
no I don't talk about it so this is box

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,790
scape and one of the really cool things

00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,610
that the creator of box Cape has done

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:21,080
Jasper is he's made all of these out of

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,550
simple rectangles so even even the

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,200
characters and things like that even

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,860
though they look pixel-based and they

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,350
look like a PNG image texture they're

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,560
not they're just he's he's coated in all

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,460
of them as individual rectangles which I

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,520
looked at and I was just really

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:41,990
impressed so basically every time you

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,720
pass three of these sticks you you get a

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,250
new bar on the top you get a new chunk

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,140
of the bar and then once you feel that

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,110
bar you go to the next level and things

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,000
get faster I also quite like the

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,540
parallax effect that he's put with the

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,790
background you can also get some coins

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,550
at various times and then you can use

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,210
those coins to unlock some other

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:08,180
characters including me and my

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,340
girlfriend and my dog they all had to be

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,760
characters on there and also Jasper's on

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:17,150
there and our science lab managers on

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,560
there as well and there's a cat and a

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:24,590
pirate and stuff so this this was a year

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,690
eight creation and I think it's pretty

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,620
cool that a year eight has an app on the

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,960
store so my second one to show you

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,430
it's called third law and I would say

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:40,610
this one has the most advanced level of

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,900
Python inside of it only because he's

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:48,650
using subclasses and things to create

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:52,100
these different cannons that fire at you

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:55,430
and the whole idea of the game is you

00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:00,980
fire the bullets and you travel in the

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:02,570
opposite direction to which you fire so

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,900
you basically got the joystick on the

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,950
bottom left and you need to be travel

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:13,700
around the screen and and kill the

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:16,460
cannons without dying and one of the

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,520
other things I really like about this is

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,570
that he's created a text-based level

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:26,450
engine so he's put in a whole bunch of

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:29,180
characters and then when it's when it's

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:33,080
parsed using a loop it will actually go

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,209
and map out all of the different cannons

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,910
whether they're spinning cannon or a

00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:40,220
4-way shooter or a two-way shooter or a

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,600
two-way shooter that's spinning he's got

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,180
different codes that represent each of

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
those so he can just build up his map so

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,810
he spent quite a lot of time building

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,890
the engine that actually reads in these

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:57,290
these blobs of text but then he's made a

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,680
hundred levels so if you go and download

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,589
this game called third law coming from

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Newton's third law then yeah you can

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:09,470
play a hundred levels it gets pretty

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,970
hard towards the end and there's even

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,360
other students of mine that are saying

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,500
yeah where's the next 100 levels which

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,870
is pretty good so this student is in

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,640
year 12 at the moment so he doesn't

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,380
really have time to build another

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,600
hundred levels but I'm sure he's gonna

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:33,920
do some crazy things in Python later on

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:42,110
this one I have to show you is from one

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:43,430
of my year 10 students and basically you

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:49,339
just have to move up and down the screen

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:51,290
and dodge dodge the blocks sometimes you

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,660
go a little bit faster and then you can

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,490
also change your your color of your

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,900
block if you don't like red you can be

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:06,360
green or blue or whatever so this one is

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:09,929
called square blockade and he built them

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,449
from scratch which was really impressive

00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:15,629
and it took him quite a long while to

00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:18,509
actually figure out why the touch events

00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:20,549
were actually basically going to the

00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,249
underneath layer and not the the menu

00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:26,239
and so it was really cool when he

00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:28,110
actually got that to work in the end

00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:31,410
there's two different way to control it

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,749
you can control it by just having the

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,339
screen divided in half and the left half

00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:37,319
of the screen goes down and the right

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,910
half of the screen goes up so you can

00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,709
touch the left or the right and the

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,720
other way you can play it is if you

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,999
enable the buttons then as you can see

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:52,309
you've got the up and down buttons on

00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:57,449
the left this one right here is called

00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:59,819
fan run and I thought that's pretty cool

00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,829
there's a giant fan that's running after

00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:16,079
you and you basically just have to jump

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:19,649
over the gaps so one other cool thing

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,779
about this is I guess all of the the

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:24,539
saving of the information and things all

00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,039
of the saving of the high scores and the

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,159
settings and things like that is done

00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,289
with pickle so that's probably another

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:34,019
thing that I really like about Python is

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:36,740
that you can just import pickle and you

00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,909
can easily load and save information

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,190
quite often they'll just be using a

00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:44,580
dictionary with various keys to store

00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,860
different integers but I find it a

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:53,580
really easy way to just save high scores

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:57,360
and other information this game right

00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,809
here is called combo crush and it was

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,450
actually one of our well our first game

00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:06,059
that's being designed in portrait mode

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,340
and you basically just have to look at

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,260
the color in the top right which at the

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,139
moment says purple and you have to swipe

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,860
three purples and the thing I really

00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:19,450
like about that is that he's using the

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,359
three methods to detect touches and

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:27,429
touch began touch moved and touch ended

00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:30,039
and when a touch begins he's creating

00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:32,289
like an empty list and then as you swipe

00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,989
your finger over these blocks

00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:37,659
it adds whatever block you've swiped

00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:40,869
over to that list and then at the end

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,789
when you release your finger it will

00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,429
look over that list that it's just

00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,769
created and figure out if they all match

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,499
that same color and if they all match

00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,570
the same color and that color is still

00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:55,119
the one that selected at the top then

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,929
you get the points but if you happen to

00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:00,279
select like three Reds and a purple well

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,519
you're not getting your points for those

00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,979
Reds because you made a mistake it also

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,329
makes a really good use of actions to

00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,089
animate the block so when I disappear

00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:11,739
and also the score number animate its

00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:17,619
way up into the top left of the screen

00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:20,200
as well so now I'm going to show you

00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:26,079
some work that's basically a work in

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:30,429
progress this is some work by one of my

00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:33,219
students in year ten and he's basically

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:38,259
creating a game called attack of the

00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:40,929
goblin army or goblin rush and a lot of

00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:44,109
the math involved with this came out of

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:48,190
how to get these cannons to range

00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:50,469
properly so as these goblins walk past

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:55,179
if they are within range of the cannon

00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:57,659
that will be shot so basically what what

00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:01,539
he did to fix that or get that working

00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:05,440
was every one second he's doing a check

00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:08,099
on each of the cannons and then he's

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:13,950
just checking to see which of the other

00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:16,629
goblins inside of that radius so

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,749
obviously the goblins are stored within

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,279
a list and then the other characters are

00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:23,109
as well

00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:28,599
he's looping over that list and he's

00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:29,889
doing a a math dot high pot function to

00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:32,320
figure out the distance between the two

00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:34,510
points and if it's in range or not

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:42,040
and if it's in range then it gets shot

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:44,860
and it loses some health this is some

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,220
work that I guess showed a I think a

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,660
great deal of perseverance so I guess

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,540
one of the foundation things that I show

00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,460
my students is a game similar to this

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,800
and if you have a look on my YouTube

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:02,830
it's on there he had the idea that when

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,990
you collect a powerup that you should be

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,690
able to fire unlimited bullets rather

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,180
than just having a few on the screen at

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,130
a time and so he wanted whenever you

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,150
collect one of the power-ups he wanted

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:19,030
it so that a timer was started and then

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,160
that powerup would only last for five

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,680
seconds and it took him a little while

00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,450
to figure out how he was going to start

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,170
the timer how he was going to tick the

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,300
timer down and then what to do when the

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,220
time was finished reaching it -

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,070
resetting it to zero and things like

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:42,820
that and then yeah he was really proud

00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:44,950
when he got to work and so was I this is

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,570
some work from one of my year writes and

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,140
I guess this is just to show you what

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,540
some of the code looks like this is a

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,600
soccer physics game that one of my year

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,830
actors trying to work to build and the

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,810
ultimate goal that he wants to be able

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,930
to do is to swipe around the screen and

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:08,580
to move the soccer ball

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:12,040
just by swiping it and so at the moment

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,590
the soccer ball will bounce inside of

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,140
the goals and outside of the goals so

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:20,560
he's got some of the bouncing things to

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,080
work but it's at the point where he's

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,340
trying to get the swipes to work and so

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,010
you can see here that he's using a clasp

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,750
and it actually comes in a template so

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,900
you basically just have to fill in

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,090
whatever method you want to use so I

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,390
quickly tell you the different types of

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:44,440
methods we have setup that happens once

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,910
when you run your code we have update

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,910
which happens

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:51,160
every single frame and at the moment all

00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,290
of our games run at 60 frames a second

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,710
so that method just gets run and run and

00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,910
run and then you've got your three

00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,860
methods that handle the touches touch

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,420
began when you put your finger on the

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,710
screen touch ended when you take your

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,660
finger off the screen and then touch

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,700
moved when you do a drag and so all of

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,910
this sort of building up code goes into

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,740
setup and then yeah you just put in

00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:19,180
different bits of code in different

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:24,280
spots this was some work by the u12 that

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:26,470
made third bomb and it just shows some

00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,360
of the really advanced things that he's

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:33,640
doing in terms of his mathematics work

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,550
so I guess this was when he was in year

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,190
11 he did some some really good

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:42,160
mathematics work and actually submitted

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,020
an assignment based on this and he then

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,390
later told me that well without python

00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,890
and without the knowledge that i showed

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:52,810
him and without him getting into python

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:56,380
he wouldn't have been able to do work up

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,880
to this standard and i think that's

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,880
really cool because i can't take the

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,430
credit for him using matplotlib or

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,680
whatever but i certainly showed him some

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,650
Python and started him in on the right

00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,630
way so that's some of the other things

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:16,090
that my students have been using this

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:21,970
for apart from games so I don't quite

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:24,360
understand that graph but he does so

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,360
that's all right

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,340
so Jasper's also been working on some

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,190
advanced concepts as well he's the one

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,900
that's been doing some crazy stuff with

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,790
open geo shaders and basically he's he's

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,610
implementing some sine wave functions

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:46,210
which actually involved differentiating

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,510
and he's trying to make the legs in this

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:53,760
little scene he's trying to make the

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:56,020
legs actually look sort of natural and

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,360
that's the good thing about this is if

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,029
it actually doesn't contain all of the

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,559
physics body stuff in it

00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:04,979
so you can't just go away and use it you

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,849
have to actually code it yourself which

00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:08,340
further

00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:11,719
I guess reinforces the the physics

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,719
knowledge and the mathematical knowledge

00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:17,219
so this is what he was showing me was

00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:21,269
like a small test of the way that

00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:24,320
different things can move and then he

00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:35,159
was showing me what he applied it to

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:39,440
which is this so basically he's moving

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,979
left and right and his legs are moving

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,979
the way they're meant to

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,280
this is therefore to show that you know

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,670
whatever you create on the iPad can be

00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:03,510
scaled down and then I have one final

00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:05,250
video to show you an Aussie school is

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,620
making a name for itself in the app

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,850
world students from ABBA File Park High

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,980
School have been designing and

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,660
developing their own apps their schools

00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,090
even become the first in the country to

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:22,770
be registered as a developer under its

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:25,290
own name take a look this is my game

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,930
goblin rush and the aim of the game is

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,480
to place cannons to shoot little green

00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:34,050
Goblin's as they run past my game is box

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,720
gate and the idea is to get as many

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,790
points as you can you gain points by

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,190
ojung orange rectangles

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,500
my game's name is space shooter it's a

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,240
game way to your screen to control a

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,370
spaceship and you have to shoot the

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,560
asteroids these are just some of the

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:54,680
games the guys from a before Park High

00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,680
School have created all thanks to coding

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,070
twice a week they get together at

00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,870
lunchtime for a special coating workshop

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,670
we're gonna have a guy detecting some

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,010
collisions between the mogees and the

00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:11,480
laser it's been running for three years

00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:14,150
coating is using different letters or

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,250
blocks depending what type of code

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,740
you're using to make something happen on

00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,600
a digital object it's really enjoyable

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,000
it's my first time doing it this year

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,170
and it's really something different

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,920
coding can be a bit hard to start off

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,300
with but it gets easier I'm going to

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,280
stop it there because I would like some

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,470
time for some questions thank you so

00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,900
much for listening to my talk and this

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,650
concludes my presentation does anyone

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:45,340
have any questions thank you Chris thank

00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:45,340
you questions

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,160
[Music]

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,299
thank you very much for your talk I was

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,279
wondering if you could go back today I

00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,710
think the third game where there was a

00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,859
running boy oh man

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,230
was it fan run I think so

00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:14,789
I just I just want you to run it again

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:17,059
now when I was having I was wondering

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,059
about something

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,169
yes I'm seeing that I think I will that

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,750
is after a boy I want to see what

00:28:53,169 --> 00:29:00,429
happens when he's not oh is it a video

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,710
you see there's that wheel at the back

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:06,490
that is running after the boy oh that's

00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:09,130
the fan fan fan comes across like that

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:14,220
yeah but does it we cut him off if he

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,220
stops running or is it just there for

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,059
yeah I think it's just a fan and it

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,190
doesn't actually cut him because he

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:25,000
falls down then is he always running by

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,380
default yeah yeah sorry I probably

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,919
wasn't explained he's continuously

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:39,179
running and you just have to jump this

00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:41,710
will probably be our last question okay

00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,960
that that particular game was something

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,870
I wanted to ask about also there's a

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,669
gravity built into that did the kids

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,260
research and write their own gravity or

00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,309
is that come with the yes they the

00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:01,539
students have to implement their own

00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:07,809
gravity functions that's all we have

00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:10,230
time for thank you Chris thank you thank

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,230
