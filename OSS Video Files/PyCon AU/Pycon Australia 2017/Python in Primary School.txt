Thank you very I would like to introduce

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,230
Emily de la pena the founder of coding

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,990
kids and advanced Queensland's community

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,490
digital champion developing the next

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,220
generation of coders innovators and

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:22,619
changemakers up in Queensland a civil

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,810
engineer Emily now sharing her passion

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,060
for science technology engineering arts

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,279
and mathematics through coding kids and

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,260
working with directly with children to

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,329
become technology creators and also

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,250
working to empower teachers and

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,950
librarians to integrate the new digital

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,820
digital technology subjects into their

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:51,840
classrooms so thank you Emily thanks

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:54,780
Nick hi everyone I'm Emily I'm the

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,699
founder of coding kids and we're now in

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,149
over 20 schools around Queensland

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,640
teaching over 400 students so how did I

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,280
get here I'm not a teacher I'm not even

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,210
a programmer so let me start from the

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,700
beginning so in 2015 I started

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,150
volunteering with coda dojo it's a

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,790
non-profit run by volunteers delivering

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,580
free children's coding workshops at

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,590
libraries around Brisbane and I was

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,909
there and I could see that there was so

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,460
much fun all these kids were getting

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,590
really into it and I had all these ideas

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,119
of how I wanted to make improvements in

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,009
how we run coderdojo but already we're

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,909
running on volunteers volunteering their

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,939
free time it's run for free so it's

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:47,159
really hard to scale and improve on free

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,380
so I decided January 2016

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,509
I started cold calling and I started my

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,229
first two coding clubs at two schools

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,399
with 50 students and now a year and a

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,530
half later we're at over 20 schools over

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,479
400 students and we're touring regional

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,610
Queensland so we're going out to Long

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,509
Reach Mount Isaac and Bundaberg

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,220
Rockhampton lots of regional areas

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,569
training the trainer's kick-starting

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,329
programs in those centers so that the

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,260
as librarians parents can continue with

00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:21,040
the program

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,739
so it's been an exciting place and in 18

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,859
months we've managed to do this but how

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:30,000
did we get to do this so quickly it has

00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:34,090
a lot to do with a changing environment

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,409
so we've I think a few people have

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,060
already mentioned we've got a few new

00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:41,530
subjects so in the primary school area

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,889
we've got two new subjects designing

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,609
technologies and digital technologies so

00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:50,469
we started working with schools working

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,900
with teachers trying to make sense of

00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:55,030
what does this new technology subject

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,959
mean and what kind of class activities

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:01,449
can we start delivering for it so what's

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,419
been happening in Queensland so we

00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:06,219
started off in 2016 with 17 trialed

00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,900
primary schools who are starting to just

00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:11,409
have a go with the to new technology

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,629
subjects so their responsibilities which

00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:15,340
is just to experiment and then to share

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,319
their experiences with all the other

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,340
schools in particular in their clusters

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,319
and then in 2017 all school all

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,180
Queensland schools now need to start

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:29,229
having a go with the digital technology

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:34,620
subject and getting ready for full

00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:36,849
implementation by 2020 so this has been

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,930
really interesting to see in Queensland

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,639
especially with the schools that we're

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,590
working with so at the moment with

00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,299
coding kids we deliver extra curricular

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,780
workshops for children so their

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:51,579
after-school coding clubs and school

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,229
holiday coding programs so we've been we

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,239
started off with scratch in primary

00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,799
school and then as students start to get

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,659
familiar with scratch we started to move

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,569
them onto Python for the year five and

00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,819
six students and this is our fourth term

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,120
of running our Python program so we've

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,099
had a few iterations of improving every

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,299
term so we what we experiment with the

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:14,409
kids see how they respond to how we

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,370
explore the different topics and

00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:20,109
projects and so from this space of being

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,360
extracurricular we started to see well

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:25,449
how can we start matching it up with a

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,409
digital technologies curriculum so we

00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,490
started working with a couple of

00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,940
teachers on how to do

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,060
that so we decided okay we'll work on

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,860
building these two projects one that

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,710
looks at digital technologies and

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,960
science for year five and digital

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,819
technologies in English for year six so

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,930
we're doing up all sorts of projects for

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,610
different year levels and different

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,500
subject areas so we're looking at

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,400
integrating digital technologies until

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,919
all the other subjects with different

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,949
projects using you know scratch scratch

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,840
jr. makey makey things like that but

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:05,979
I'll go through the Python projects

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,800
obviously here okay so what we did was a

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:14,650
solar system quiz for the year five

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,870
students and a text adventure game for

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,520
digital technologies and English for

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,940
year six so let's have a look at that

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,240
now this is pretty interesting because

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,580
in some schools we get to use Idol and

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,229
other schools we can't access we can't

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,199
download Python so we end up having to

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:34,570
use trinket so I'll show you what we end

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,840
up doing with them trinket and I'll talk

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:44,800
a bit about that experience as well so

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:48,400
let's have a look at our space game so

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,400
we do a solar system quiz and it's quite

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,180
simple so on the Left eco why is that

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,180
not showing let's have a look

00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,239
oh not sure why that's not working

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:36,830
now not showing okay sorry about this

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,830
folks

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,330
okay

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,920
and it still

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:15,700
okay so our solar system quiz let's have

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:19,030
a play shall we so what's your name

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,260
Emily okay what's the fourth planet from

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:27,460
the Sun hmm let's have a look yes is it

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,700
Mars correct which planet has visible

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:34,240
rings hmm let's see what happens if I

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,360
get this wrong oh sorry the correct

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,540
answer is satin and then what is a large

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,540
space rock called let's see asteroid

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,730
correct you've got two out of three

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,360
questions right so this is a fun little

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:55,030
solar system quiz that we built with

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,070
Python using trinket because in some of

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:02,290
our schools this is what we have to work

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:05,020
with so you can see here it's quite

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,420
simple we start looking at oh how do we

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,630
input from a question how do we store it

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,630
into a variable we can start to look at

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,580
how we keep score and we can start to

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,770
use parallels with scratch because our

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,170
students end up going from scratch on to

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,510
Python and there's a lot of similarities

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,510
between the two for example with

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,580
scorekeeping it's the same sort of step

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,970
so you can start to go back to what they

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:36,700
already know from using score as a

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:38,650
variable in scratch and then they start

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,060
to learn a few extra things what happens

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,010
when we type in Saturn with a capital S

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,950
versus lowercase so we start playing

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,110
with a few extra things with pythons so

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,180
the students get to write their own

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,220
question and answers and play each

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,780
other's games the other project so using

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,910
digital technologies and English is

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:06,130
looking at a text adventure game let's

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,500
have a look at this one okay so what's

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,500
your name adventurer so let's have it go

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,960
Emily so they start to write their own

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,390
story so text adventure game is not

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,010
different to the popular stories from

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,440
the 90s if you remember the choose your

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,540
own adventure novels so just like that

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,640
except this one's online so it's super

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,700
fun you get to create your own imaginary

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,820
worlds imaginary quests and characters

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,510
so it's a really exciting place if you

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,490
love that sort of storytelling okay so

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,610
you're in the forest do you want to step

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,830
into the forest okay yes right so you're

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,840
you head into the forest you hear crows

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,940
cawing in the distance in front of you

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,090
you see a stone on it is a sword and a

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,520
bow what weapon do you take hmm I might

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,830
take a bow

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,110
okay the path ahead Forks into to your

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,810
left you hear a roar to the you're right

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,600
the forest becomes much darker which

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,580
path do you take hmm let's follow the

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,230
roar shall we let's go to the left oh

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,810
you had left a head is a bear

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,490
you will jabo you have no arrows you are

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:18,220
eaten goodbye Emily so it's so much fun

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:23,820
because they start off first with this

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,820
story so I always encourage them to

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,020
start off with this story where does it

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,340
go don't have too many options at the

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,640
beginning otherwise you might get

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,590
confused with your if and else so just

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,750
something very simple just a few options

00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:41,110
because you can always make it bigger

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,940
and bigger and so there's a lot of

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,910
freedom in terms of creativity in the

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:51,400
storytelling so it's quite a fun

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:53,230
experience okay so yes we do sometimes

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,350
have to use trinket in some schools

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,960
where we don't have access to

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,420
downloading pythons so at this level

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,850
when it's still really working with very

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:09,040
simple programs very simple concepts

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:10,930
it's it works pretty much but there are

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,300
some limitations when you start to get

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,220
into more complex programming but we

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,000
never really head into that space I

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,040
would say personally in the main issue

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,470
with using trinket is it doesn't quite

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,030
feel like you're programming because it

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,000
still feels like you're playing a game

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,590
on a website and

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,260
sort of the thing that we're trying to

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,760
move away from so interestingly we just

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,770
spoke to speech someone in the audience

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,080
about another way that we can use a

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,260
portable Python off a USB and I think

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,090
that might be our next step and have to

00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,070
step away from Trinket but it's been a

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,830
really good experience so far this has

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,230
been our fourth term of running Python

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:53,360
programs and it's been really good for

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,030
us at this stage yep so we're also

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,300
traveling around regional Queensland

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:03,540
these are free workshops for teachers

00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,460
and librarians and parents as well as

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,290
children who want to come along

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:12,570
funded by state government so it's been

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:15,330
really good for the regional areas so

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,340
what's next for us so we're really lucky

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,170
in Brisbane because we've got the pepper

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,490
studio there so we're working closely

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,860
with them we're delivering a Python and

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,730
so pepper these pepper robots they use

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,410
choreograph and Python and we've just

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,470
started recently so that's been a lot of

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,120
fun we're also working on micro bit

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,280
projects with the kids it's really good

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,990
because it's got built-in LEDs so we can

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,700
build fun games with that but you can

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,100
also extend it with the bread boards and

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,860
things like that yep looking towards a

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,980
portable Python option for schools where

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,120
we can't Act download Python and then

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,270
there's also that question of breadth

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,100
versus depth so that's something that

00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,660
we're also working with like how much

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,450
depth can we go at this level especially

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,100
at primary school you know it's still

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,839
pretty good to chop and chain and look

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,490
at all the different applications that

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,500
we can experience what's been really

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,170
interesting in this journey as well is

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,200
that because we've come from the

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,089
extracurriculars space and we're heading

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,730
more an assisting schools with

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,740
implementation in school is that for me

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,320
personally one thing that I really like

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,080
with this full implementation in schools

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,850
is that you get to see higher rates of

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,980
girls getting involved when it's

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:39,330
compulsory so we went from having 25%

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,730
girls in our workshops to 40% girls for

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,110
the simple reason that we've

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,360
we're getting we're delivering

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,700
compulsory classes so that's one thing

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,200
that's really important in that space

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:53,150
because otherwise it's not just about

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,280
girls not feeling they interested but

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,830
perhaps perceptions that parents might

00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,410
have if it's an extracurricular activity

00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,120
and the decision has to be made at home

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:08,690
in the household between parents and

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:09,800
children what else so what next like I'd

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,080
really love to continue this

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,480
conversation with everyone here see what

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,970
people's experiences have been um a lot

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,170
of what we've been doing has been

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,290
experimental but it's been pretty

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,150
exciting because we just learn at every

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,370
iteration every term we watch the

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:28,670
students respond to different projects

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,090
different way that we explore and learn

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,130
yeah it's just I guess because I've not

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,170
come from an education background it's

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,950
just been a lot of experimentation and

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:42,140
it's been really fun yep so any

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,300
questions and then feel free to contact

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:53,720
me I'm on social media I blog a lot

00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:55,280
thank you very much Emily and it's good

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,830
to get the primary school perspective as

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,990
well yeah okay so if we have any

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,950
questions for primary school level or

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,950
the Queensland experience

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:16,089
Emily I'm through of the the game the

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:18,489
the question asking game I saw a lot of

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,679
kind of repetition in that yeah how much

00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,929
of that was code that you'd provided and

00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,809
how much of that was code that you kind

00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:29,980
of taught I guess how did that evolve to

00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:31,389
what we saw as much yeah so by the time

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,239
they were building these sorts of

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:37,679
projects they've already done one term

00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:40,540
so what we're but I'm finding an um a

00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,999
primary school level is that you spend

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,069
one term doing just lots of really

00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:47,290
little activities so they're not even

00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,869
building like games yet and that's where

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,970
that sort of magical bridge is between

00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:55,119
our let's learn just what simple things

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,980
are like just print or input or saving

00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:00,730
to have you know a variable in like

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,379
little activities culminating to here's

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,959
a project okay so there's all these

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:08,230
tools that we've already learned let's

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,179
talk about it so we start off building

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,730
out the structure in terms of comments

00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:14,110
so what's all the different steps that

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,209
we need to do and then we fill out the

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,470
comments with the actual code of okay

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:22,209
well what do we need to do to actually

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:29,259
then code that so I guess you didn't see

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:34,179
that's a bit beforehand yeah any further

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:36,490
questions in terms of the battlespace

00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:38,290
game does that take our whole term in

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,360
terms of the amount of time you spend on

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,360
it is that one afternoon a week is it

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,240
one one lesson during week so we do one

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,559
hour a week for the term so but

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,619
generally last eight or nine weeks yep

00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:56,499
so for that yeah so it'll take about two

00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:59,740
or three weeks of like building out a

00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:01,509
structure doing things that are yeah

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,189
building out the structure but then the

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:04,569
kids will do their own questions and

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:09,159
then they start adding their own

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,319
features so some kids will start to the

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,299
really the fast kids they'll start

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,130
building out a dictionary with the

00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,429
question and answers and then randomly

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,889
selecting the question to do that so you

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,880
can see that kids will start we get to a

00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:24,069
minimum point

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,709
together and then the projects will

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,709
diverge to what the kids feel like doing

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:42,190
hi I'm great tog I would like to ask

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,610
what are the key elements for you to

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,130
keep the kids engaged during throughout

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,200
the whole session because I have I am

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,940
currently teaching some of the school

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,730
kids and it's really hard to get their

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,670
attention and really hard get the like

00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,890
keep them engaged into the toss like

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,440
what is your recommendation with other

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,640
key Jones yeah the key is to show you

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,710
that the end product first so first we

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,650
talk about like I will show we'll do a

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,540
demo of their project and then we get

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,370
them to each have a go and playing it

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,530
and then we talk about it we talk about

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,080
what do you think we need to do to build

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,880
that what are some extra features or how

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,190
would you personalize your project

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,710
because I don't want I encourage them to

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,570
always personalize a project like well

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,700
the structure will be similar the

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,880
minimum point will be similar but it's

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,160
about them engaging in it in a way that

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,680
suits their personality and interest so

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,230
admittedly if it's when you look at the

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,700
solar system quiz versus the text

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,290
adventure and the solar system if you

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,090
sit within a unit which is you know

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,370
learning about the solar system well

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,910
then they can research their own

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,620
questions and answers and then and then

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,230
that'll be their own contextually but

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,660
say the text adventure one you can see

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,020
with that one it's so creative you could

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,470
like they love storytelling they're

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,600
already storytellers so you know whether

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,820
you're you've got some imaginary

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,040
Candyland and you're a unicorn you know

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,050
try you know going on an adventure or

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,840
you're in a forest and you come across

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,450
trolls and ogres and stuff when your

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,710
personality is embedded in the project

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,380
that's it

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,000
so it's project and context first and

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,880
then all that logic and engine

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,050
underneath that's almost secondary but

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,600
it's hard when you're trying to fit it

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,800
into like a solar system unit and it's

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,890
like okay well we're all going to learn

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,960
about planets and stars right now and

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,970
so I think that's where the struggle is

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,830
the more creativity the more

00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:48,299
personalization that's where you can

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:51,360
really hook them in yeah I the regional

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,280
stuff you've been doing is amazing you

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,040
go out there and run workshops and yeah

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,650
support the teachers how do you continue

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:03,990
that support and engagement unless you

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:07,500
spend yeah so we can only do two three

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:10,320
days so for example next week my team

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,580
like two plus two others plus myself

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,100
we're going to be in Kingaroy for three

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,710
days so that's as much as the grant

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,530
money can cover but we spend a lot of

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,410
time with them during our time there and

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,299
then afterwards we'll continue maintain

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,850
contact see how they're going see if

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:29,309
they want because you know the Internet

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,530
is full of free resources but what a lot

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,450
of these people need is just someone to

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,860
sort it and give them exactly what they

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,790
need when they need it

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,580
and so for those contacts we have

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,710
afterwards they're lucky to have that so

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,720
I hope they make the most of it but also

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,570
I guess it's part of the grant funding

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,330
it's compulsory to report on the impact

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,450
I have to and so like before we engage

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,070
with them we talk about that commitment

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:03,090
because I would want to keep my end of

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:05,549
the bargain yeah so I'm gonna sneak in a

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,990
question of my own along those lines so

00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:08,580
you had the relationship with the

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:14,640
Queensland Government and I was curious

00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:17,220
how that came about sure I guess from

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,400
right at the beginning it came out of

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,860
the advance Queensland program so out of

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,150
that one of the there's a number of

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,350
things that come out of that but one of

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:31,290
them one of the things is their

00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:33,660
community digital champions so I was

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,340
nominated by one of my schools and I got

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,160
that and as part of that community

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,630
there's a lot of events where there's

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,980
opportunities to network with all the

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:47,210
other digital champions so and as part

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,930
of that network were encouraged to

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,090
report and write

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,400
about all the projects that we do and

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,990
then as part of that something else came

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,220
up and then they asked if I wanted to

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,810
participate and of course I did and so

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,060
some of it has been organic and other

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,910
others have been well as a result of

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,340
this community and the communication and

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,510
storytelling they identify you as you

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,590
know someone who can participate in

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:16,200
their approach in other programs so it's

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:18,420
just I guess me making an effort to

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,990
maintain relationships with all the

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:24,860
people in the network and sharing the

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:31,520
stories as we delivered projects that

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,520
contribute to that any further questions

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,260
you know thanks for the talk um I was

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,680
just gonna ask where do you see it going

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,260
from here like is the grant ongoing yeah

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,790
there's different departments with

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,070
different buckets of money so at this

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,500
stage I'm sure you're all like digital

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,260
literacy education is such a hot topic

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,870
so there's a lot of money going in this

00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,570
space so I'm not sure how long that'll

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,730
last I'd like to think that it's ongoing

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,610
but I think especially with the full

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,810
implementation of digital technologies

00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,940
in Queensland I don't know what the

00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,220
timeframes are for everywhere else like

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,980
there needs to be a lot of support for

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,320
that implementation to happen at ground

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,180
level because it's not easy it's not

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,340
just a bolt-on subject it has to be

00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,100
fully integrated into the existing

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,320
subjects as you can see the solar system

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,030
one was a science project that and then

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,950
there was an English project it's not

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:33,680
just learning coding for coding sake

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:37,890
it's embedded into a subject area sorry

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:41,250
in some ways you know it's easy in other

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:44,610
ways it's not very easy so there needs

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:48,680
to be ongoing support otherwise it's

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,680
just policy that won't make its way down

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,250
do you have built into your acquittal

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:07,260
some sort of sustainability after the

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:09,520
gram yes so we need to maintain

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,720
communications with our contacts in the

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,650
regional areas and also collect I guess

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:20,470
data on how their programs are going how

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,600
often they run it their attendance how

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,330
they spread it further within their

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,570
community so yeah I need to report back

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,020
on the impacts of the grants after the

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:45,460
event

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:47,530
yes is that what you well I guess I

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,470
would like to keep doing it I guess it's

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,600
a question of how much can it you know

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,310
because I guess we are a business and I

00:24:52,600 --> 00:25:00,040
still have to keep paying for my staff

00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:02,170
to go out there yeah I think we'll keep

00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,550
trying our best but I don't know how far

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:11,050
we can keep it going

00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:12,940
yep okay if there are any further

00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,720
questions so thank you once again Emily

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,720
great talk

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,909
and that will be the lunch break now and

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,909
