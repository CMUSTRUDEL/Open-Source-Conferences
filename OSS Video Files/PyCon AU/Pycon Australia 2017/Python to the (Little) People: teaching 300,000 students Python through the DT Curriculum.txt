	00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,850
all right coming up next this is the key

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:16,859
turn this is the highlight of the day

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:23,460
don't miss it okay I'd like to bring up

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,900
to the stage Amanda Hagen can start

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,810
switching your laptop over while I start

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,310
talking um Amanda never ceases to amaze

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,500
me with her innovative approaches to

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,070
getting kids excited about coding and

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,940
about technology she is a teacher at a

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,250
go School in Sydney and with them she

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,559
gets them to build foreign apps and so

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,440
wearable technology into clothes with

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,140
little flashing LEDs and everything

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,489
she spent a spare time helping out with

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,140
the girls programming network getting

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,379
even more girls excited about computer

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,129
science and also the current president

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,680
of the ICT educators New South Wales I

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,290
don't know how you do all of it

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,769
please welcome Amanda

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,769
[Applause]

00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,090
okay I have to do all of that again I'm

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,250
also a computer education specialist for

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,830
the Australian computing Academy so I'm

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,590
a part-time teacher this year and a

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,480
part-time computer education specialist

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,070
when we've defined that properly I'll

00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,060
let you know what it is but at the

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,190
moment it's just getting a new national

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,730
project up off the ground so we have

00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:59,200
some federal funding and where we're

00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:03,100
trying to reach 300,000 students which

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,410
turns out to be quite a lot and so that

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,100
where the 300,000 comes from is we did

00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,740
an ABS search and he's 785 students

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,020
across Australia have been funded by the

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,480
federal government for free to do

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,490
something and it was our job to go and

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
work out what that something was

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,090
and so I'm telling you a bit of the

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,670
story of that today okay so in 2015 the

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,950
government decided that maybe the world

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,010
of work and industry was changing a

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,459
little bit and that was quite late for

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,190
them to come to the party handily acara

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:42,610
had been had decided that several years

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,500
previously and so we had a National

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,170
Curriculum coming in digital

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,600
technologies and so the federal

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,690
government said okay as part of the

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,300
National Innovation and science agenda

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,250
we are going to fund something something

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:03,220
digital technologies it's going to be

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:06,160
easy okay so the we have this National

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,500
Curriculum that was drafted in 2012 and

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,870
then went through curriculum is as

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,470
everybody would know excruciatingly

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,630
least slow so drafted in 2012 which took

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,690
some time to get to that point then goes

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,760
into consult consultation phase and

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,230
people give feedback on what's good

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,709
about it was bad about it what's not

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,250
going to work

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,380
logistical e and then it gets formed

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,239
eventually and then once it's formed

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,470
people get really excited and start

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,410
implementing it straight away unless

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,680
you're New South Wales and so now we

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,019
have

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,180
implementation of the National

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,019
Curriculum ish

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,829
mostly 2019 the rest of that puzzle will

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:52,310
fall into place

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:54,889
um okay so now we have three hundred

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,530
thousand students a plus more coming on

00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:59,599
all the time because of you know your

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,950
six in your eighth and then you nine in

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,750
your ten which the federal government

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,639
haven't quite worked out how to do yet

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,590
so we're just focusing on the three

00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,260
hundred thousand because that's enough

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,409
and we're really struggling to find

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:16,099
trained teachers who are capable of

00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:19,959
teaching this at in schools and also to

00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:22,610
train teachers as they come out and

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,520
change or people that are changing from

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:29,500
subject subject so we have what we would

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,900
call a wicked problem it's kind of

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,000
nebulous we have some teachers we're not

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,979
sure how many of them are awesome rock

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,229
stars at coding we don't know how many

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,870
of them are really terrified of

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:44,570
computers and there's a huge spectrum in

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,570
there and we have to reach the ones that

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,060
need the help and leverage the ones that

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,830
don't need the help and somehow reach

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,949
this extraordinary number of students so

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,840
how do we solve this problem of getting

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,539
digital technologies curriculum when we

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,930
don't have the people to deliver it the

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:07,810
other problem that compounds this is and

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,490
I am a New South Wales teacher

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,639
embarrassed about that little black hole

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,539
in Australia but this is the New South

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:21,050
Wales primary school upper primary

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:25,280
breakdown of hours in a day or in a year

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,860
and so science and technology get six to

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,380
ten percent of the curriculum now let's

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,810
be honest maths and science aware NAPLAN

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,419
is so sorry math in English of where

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,120
NAPLAN is so they kind of creep a little

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,039
bit bigger around that at the edges so

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,440
let's call science and technology six

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:47,990
percent technology is half of that

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,270
ish so three percent being generous

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,630
digital technologies is half

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:58,390
that so that's one point five percent so

00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:01,280
we're talking 25 minutes a week yeah so

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,920
that's not turns out not a lot of time

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,130
to do really cool world-changing

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,660
projects and so we have to work out how

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:15,680
to make it easy make it doable and also

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,720
to join it with other areas of study so

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,680
that we can kind of hit two birds with

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,730
that one stone adding to our problems

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,780
okay so acara

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,940
which is the Australian Curriculum

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,030
assessment a reporting Authority if you

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,580
if you're not familiar did come up with

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,320
ten key concepts for our digital

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,730
technologies curriculum and I think

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,200
they're really useful I think they're

00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,480
really useful because I have a computer

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,820
science degree so I know what

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,420
abstraction is but they're not all that

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,190
useful to the average teacher who has to

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,550
and I don't mean average as in bad I

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,400
mean average as in you know mean that

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,830
people that have the training in

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,170
education so I'm gonna tell you a story

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,750
about my friend Karen Karen is fantastic

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,930
she's an awesome teacher she is a

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,300
teacher librarian and she is always

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,090
pushing her practice forward she's

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,030
trying to she tries to integrate

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,820
technology wherever she can she's using

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,490
web tools she was one of the first web

00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,190
2.0 people everything has a wiki or a

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,980
blog she's really keen and really

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,440
excited about education and leveraging

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,800
technology to make education better so

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,070
then she went on maternity leave and got

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,480
an email while on maternity leave that

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,700
actually now she was in charge of

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,200
digital technologies curriculum for his

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,120
five and six ok so why because she knew

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,710
how to turn on a computer and they're

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,750
like computers is the same and that's a

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,640
bit of a worry because digital

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,520
technologies and using computers isn't

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,340
the same but she's she's a good teacher

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,500
she's really keen enthusiastic and knows

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,680
how to read a curriculum so off she went

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,530
and she read the curriculum which is I

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,770
think bye-bye design a little bit a

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,020
little bit fuzzy around the edges it's

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,000
not a New South Wales dot point

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,490
curriculum that tells you exactly what

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,259
to do and what to cover because they

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,509
want it to be a little bit flexible to

00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:22,009
fit in all kinds of places but the

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,039
problem with that is that people that

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:27,229
don't have the training like Karen read

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,330
all of this stuff and then have to sit

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,699
on Webber pedia working out what all

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,969
those words mean and then still aren't

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,860
sure how to do that with a classroom of

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:42,560
11 year old boys who will smell a little

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:47,180
bit so she she was actually doing things

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,940
that were not not what should be covered

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,459
in years five because of how the

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,290
elaborations is structured and that's

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,450
unfortunate so we need to help her

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,750
because she is one of our super teachers

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:03,100
so what we did at the ACA we started off

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,480
this year got the ball rolling with

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,250
analyzing the digital technologies

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,150
curriculum in detail don't read this

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:15,320
slide but I'm just showing you that

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:17,810
we've broken those ten kind of weird

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,350
computer science you type terms down

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,150
into a myriad of terms that have very

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,279
specific definitions and show a

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:32,089
trajectory from K through to 10 we'll

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:36,290
worry about senior leader so that shows

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:40,520
how things like sequencing changes

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,850
between year two and three and year nine

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,440
and 10 so that we can show the students

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,339
how to grow from one place to the other

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,970
and we can have planned programs that

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:55,250
facilitate that so we not only did that

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,100
but we started to categorize the

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,290
internet and all of those all of those

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,060
fantastic programs that are already in

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:08,990
existence things like code Academy and

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:11,750
code.org and tick those concepts off so

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,270
that we can work out where the digital

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,290
technologies is already being met by

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,290
other resources

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,870
okay so I'm at PyCon I better tell you

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,840
why we why were you doing Python in

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,490
years seven and it's because you seven

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,290
specifically says it must have a

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,300
general-purpose programming language

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,320
general-purpose is meant to be as

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,210
opposed to block based so all of the

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,940
people that have been using scratch for

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,090
year seven game projects have to kind of

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,460
think about how in the future to switch

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,280
that over to something accessible but

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,670
also general-purpose so let's be typing

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,560
rather than dragging and dropping that's

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,500
not going to happen straight away but it

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,960
is meant to happen as you five take on

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,820
those block based programming languages

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,170
and then year six by the time they get

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,150
to you seven they're ready for the next

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:13,580
step so why Python mostly because of

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:17,480
that so we have C and JavaScript and

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,520
Python and the dive in point for any

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,970
text based programming language is hello

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,990
world and hello world in Python is one

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,700
line and it's pretty easy to start so

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,380
pretty easy to start as a really big

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,140
thing when you're teaching a whole class

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,060
of 11 year-olds particularly when the

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,400
teachers still a little bit nervous

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,160
about what they're doing

00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,720
the downside of Python is that there's a

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,930
whole section of digital technologies

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,430
curriculum that requires the design of a

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:51,950
GUI and we can't do that very well in

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,660
Python if you want to have a debate

00:11:51,950 --> 00:12:00,830
about that we can do it at morning tea

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:03,200
but we we can do with some tools but it

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:06,170
becomes really complex so but the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,760
benefits are also stem from the fact

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,360
that there's no GUI because there's no

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,850
distraction of how do I make it appear

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,160
we can actually play with just solving

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:20,660
the problems and learning some of those

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,600
syntax yeah some of the syntax words so

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,480
here is the website for the Australian

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,060
computing Academy we launched it 27th of

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,670
July we had the Education Minister come

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,500
out

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,840
we had a bunch of you five students in a

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,150
school everybody was coding there were

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,840
reporters there we managed to sneak into

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:42,420
the end of one of SBS's stories for that

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,130
knife so you may not have hit noticed

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,970
that it hit all of the national news

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,550
didn't quite make waves apparently Boris

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,820
Johnson was in town and we didn't rate

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,220
but we do exist and you can go to this

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,340
website right now and what we've got is

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,340
a really good start we have four

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,890
challenges already available some of

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,690
them meet the needs of seven and eight

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,970
some of them meet the needs of five and

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,770
six so one of them meets the needs of

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,470
five and six one of them is kind of a

00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,140
transitional one so we're not doing

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,710
Python in the fourth one so it would

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:23,400
suit you five or six but it does touch

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,140
the you seven geometry curriculum in

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,530
math so we're actually trying to cross

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:33,090
that boundary between digital

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:35,010
technologies and other subjects okay you

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:39,600
can also go here to have a look at how

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:43,130
we're unpacking the curriculum so find

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:48,840
out what some of those wacky words mean

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:51,330
and we also have workshops my team and

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,510
less me because I'm part-time and still

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,850
have classes to teach but we're

00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,930
traveling the countryside running

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:03,240
workshops for teachers and there they

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,860
are today generally at the moment

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,110
they're free where we're dealing with

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,250
the computer education groups in each of

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:17,160
the states so DL TV here ICT educators

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:20,910
in New South Wales q site it D interact

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:25,320
sorry and so all of them and we're

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:28,200
sponsoring the catering and and the

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,240
whole workshop the with that might be

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,280
changing in the future the way we

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,700
actually charge teachers for catering so

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,100
that we get a lower dropout rate so if

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,690
you really want freeness get on that

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,160
quickly yeah so we have two days

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,080
the first day is unpacking the

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,630
curriculum so what do these terms mean

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,260
and how do we do them even without a

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,780
computer we do some computer free games

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,390
we have a look at Lego it's very fun

00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,070
it's very interactive and you're the

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,600
teachers are kind of like the students

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,930
seeing how this would work in a

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,210
classroom the second day is more working

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:09,030
with our challenges so learning either

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,830
the Python language or blockly which has

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,260
Python mirrored underneath so that you

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,690
can have a trajectory from clicking

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,140
together blocks to I can type this stuff

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:24,080
and actually it's a lot faster okay so

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:27,180
that's workshops but I have a concern

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,920
and this is part of that wicked problem

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,160
we're trying to solve I'm gonna tell you

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,210
about an 11 year old I know so this is a

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,160
kid that is unusual

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:41,510
she has been coding in Python since she

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,210
was 8 years old and she understands

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,470
dictionaries she understands lists she's

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:53,010
like that's years 7 to 9 curriculum so

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,370
she's ahead of the game but she was

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,130
doing a computing competition and got

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,830
faced with a tricky file processing

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,930
problem so he had to read in a file he

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:07,530
had to do something to look to each line

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:10,860
to analyze the text pull out some

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:15,360
information and she couldn't get it to

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:18,060
work and fell apart tears I'm hopeless

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,640
that this programming is too hard I

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,700
don't want to do this anymore and my

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,430
heart just a little bit because here's a

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:30,000
kid that really is above the the

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:34,200
standard but still lacking that

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,350
resilience to say okay okay problems are

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,990
hard and I probably need to think of

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,860
another way of attacking this and just

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:46,530
went straight to disaster so we have to

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,180
look at that as a as a possibility not

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,120
just for our extraordinary kids and

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,670
there will be a bunch of them in 300,000

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,320
there'll be a bunch that know an awful

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,279
lot more than the teacher there'll be a

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,889
bunch that are ahead of

00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,889
curriculum but there'll also be a really

00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,540
large bunch at the other end and we have

00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,709
to learn how to build that resilience

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:10,890
and in my experimentation and it's not

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:13,589
very scientific but I found that in my

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:17,069
classrooms that kind of resilience can

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,809
come from context it can come from not

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,459
just learning this stuff because the

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,630
teacher said not just learning this

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,270
stuff because I'm trying to get a

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:26,789
certificate but learning it because I'm

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:30,570
trying to solve a literal problem I'm

00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:33,450
trying to process a file because it's

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,789
got my high schools in it and if I don't

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,130
process that file then I can't update

00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,179
the high scores and my game is not as

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,490
good

00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:45,240
that's a context that's a problem that

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,490
kids actually want to solve so we have

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,270
to come up with ways to make our

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:57,840
problems the kind of problems that

00:17:51,270 --> 00:18:02,610
students want to solve ok discouragement

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,700
is real part one this is I have access

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,860
to a lot of data now working with the

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,690
ACA it's it's run on the grok learning

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,760
platform they've been doing this for a

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,990
long time with students they have

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:20,850
thousands of results to trawl through

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:25,010
and what I'm with HelloWorld is that

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:29,220
there's an almost 50% fail rate on the

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:32,429
that per submission that's an

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,640
extraordinarily high number now there

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:38,640
they tend to be small problems like I

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,460
didn't capitalize the H and the W I

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:46,909
didn't put a comma in I didn't put an

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:51,360
exclamation mark in I mistyped world but

00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,669
the second graph is actually failed

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,890
after Hamlet or so passed after how many

00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:03,480
attempts so 63.5% passed after zero

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,940
attempts and then it trails off and you

00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,120
can see that after six attempts a quite

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,200
a number of the students are still going

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,690
but you might notice that there

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:19,400
little arrow there that says page to our

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:22,440
winning score on this is 28 attempts and

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,820
that if we don't have a safety net in

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,230
the classroom to say okay let me give

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,930
you a hand with that

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,770
then that's where we have kids that just

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:37,200
go I'm out you know program is for other

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,360
kinds of kids and this happen this is

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,660
the second step and this is a huge step

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,150
in programming teaching from I'm just

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,400
making output - I'm making dynamic

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,340
output based on a variable this variable

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,610
thing turns out to be a hard thing to

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,800
grasp it's quite abstract not really

00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:01,080
representable in life except with

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:03,510
buckets and so the idea that we take

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,090
input from the user we store it

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,930
somewhere and then we kick it back out

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,920
to the screen joining things together

00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:17,900
that's quite hard actually quite hard is

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:25,740
really an understatement here 75% fail

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:29,250
and we have about 50% pass on the first

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:33,630
or second attempt but this has four

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:36,870
pages our current winning score there's

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,730
quite a number in the hundreds and 128

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:45,930
is the highest score for and we never

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:49,080
want to beat that score some for how

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:52,230
many attempts to solve this and this is

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,950
with a really good marking system that

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:58,680
gives advice to users as to to the

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,500
programmer as to what they might have

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,590
done wrong like it says check your

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,760
capitalization how about you check your

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:11,100
whitespace that kind of thing and so

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,620
kids don't read that's that's a truth

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,090
that we have to deal with but even

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:23,309
without reading that's a lot of attempts

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:25,830
so we have to deal with resilience in

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:28,379
high levels don't treat yourself so

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,749
harshly we have to do with resilience in

00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:32,970
the low levels we have to have a safety

00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:36,210
net we have to deal with resilience

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,659
among teachers we have to have a safety

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,730
net for them so I'm building up to tell

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:45,840
you all of the things that make this

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,249
quite a hard project so we know that we

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,129
have a digital technologies curriculum

00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:53,639
we know that there are many students in

00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:55,679
Australia lots and lots and there are a

00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:58,889
lot of teachers who are unprepared to

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,350
teach it we have developed some things

00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:04,409
they are cool things they are worthy of

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,090
trying they are free four years five and

00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,879
year seven students you just have to

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,519
apply and we're traveling the country to

00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:13,409
prepare teachers for this curriculum and

00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,320
how to teach it in the classroom but

00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:19,830
that's not all that scalable for people

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,649
travelling the countryside so we have

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,710
more time this project last till the end

00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:30,509
of 2019 and by their New South Wales who

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:34,110
will be on board we have lots of

00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:36,690
enthusiasm we have lots of ideas but we

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,279
need scalable solutions and we need to

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,820
be able to meet the needs of all

00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:46,289
students and all teachers which is an

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,529
arduous task so I get to do some

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,529
show-and-tell

00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:05,820
come on windows right so this is the

00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:08,759
digital technologies challenge for years

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,580
seven seven and eight but only the

00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,929
sevens get it for free and it's built

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,869
around the digital technologies

00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:17,850
curriculum it's not if you're familiar

00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:20,610
with the digital technologies curriculum

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:23,159
it's not hitting every point it's not

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,690
possible to hit every point in this kind

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:32,309
of compact program so the idea is that

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:34,769
it's it's built around four weeks an out

00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,110
of two hours a week depending on how

00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:43,320
much experience your students have

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:46,289
and it it is project base which is where

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,120
we came back to that problem of students

00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:51,299
need in context to have a bit more

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,639
resilience turns out coming up with

00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,100
projects that are going to be able to be

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:59,659
done and be interesting when you don't

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:05,009
know how to do if statements yet is hard

00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:08,820
but we've given it a red-hot go so this

00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:12,960
is this is our projects when you don't

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,909
know if statements lit yet and this is a

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,549
game of mad libs there's a lot of typing

00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:21,480
which is a bit rough but handily with

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:24,600
Python you can copy and paste so we have

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,059
a bunch of inputs and then we're

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,789
teaching F strings because casting is

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,200
difficult and concatenation is difficult

00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:35,370
and so f strings take some of that out

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:39,360
of it and so the students get to make a

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:41,009
fun letter home from camp based on some

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,409
random words that get entered by the

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:47,490
user and so they can get kind of fun and

00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:51,450
ridiculous now this isn't quite right if

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:53,309
I look over here this is my definition

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,490
of my problem and what the output should

00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:58,919
look like and over here I have typed a

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,029
bunch of stuff I have all the variables

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,909
and I have just about everything and

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:12,090
then I submit it and you'll see that I

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:14,789
failed and it tells me what I passed and

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,340
what I failed so the words in the first

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,679
line the the capitalization and

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,779
punctuation the spacing all of those

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:27,379
things are right it's ticking us off one

00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,379
at a time what did I get down to I have

00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:33,870
says I have a typo on the seventh line

00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:37,620
I'm actually missing the seventh line so

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:42,500
this bit here is see you soon Jane I

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,500
need to put in I missed that whoops

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:08,370
okay turns out I can't type okay so

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,370
let's run that somebody give me a name

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:35,740
okay a relation okay a noun plural

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:39,240
animal did you say murder it's not an

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:45,630
animal neither is it a plural that

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:51,490
excellent teaching everyone's crows okay

00:26:45,630 --> 00:27:00,280
sport this is a geek room we don't know

00:26:51,490 --> 00:27:10,530
about sports adjectives spiky another

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:10,530
adjective blue verb murder

00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:24,760
okay so we've got deer second-cousin cab

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,260
dog has been spiking so far

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,880
tomorrow we will play football if the

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,460
weather is okay today it has been

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,110
raining cats and crows all day if we

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,590
cannot play football maybe we will just

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,380
murder I'm sure it will be blue either

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,050
way see you soon easy Paul

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:43,120
so nonsense it turns out to be a great

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,460
engagement point for kids they they

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
think that's fun we think that's fun

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,750
okay

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,970
so that's how you do a game that is kind

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:57,220
of gaming but doesn't have any if

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:59,160
statements in it and then I'll show you

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:05,290
what the final project looks like so

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:07,870
when they get through we do we do design

00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:10,030
backwards so we want them to be able to

00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:12,040
do something interesting here are the

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,630
things they need to learn about in order

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,650
to do something interesting

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:21,160
so it's tailored to get to the final

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,860
project so the how much of the text

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,650
processing they learn is because of

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:29,200
what's coming later if statements are

00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:33,309
necessary they have if statements that

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,880
also have a lifts and else's they have

00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:39,309
loops we had to cut out for loops it

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,870
hurt us a little bit there's a physical

00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:46,600
reaction but but while loops are more

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,679
useful for the project and for loops and

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,570
range they take some teachings so when

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,429
we skipped it and we'll do it on the

00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,490
next one okay so this is captain feather

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:04,510
bot and as you can see I am amazing I

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:10,360
passed already okay so this is a little

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:12,820
chat bot that says are a lot are and and

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,309
that's how we make it fun that he says

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,490
some ridiculous things and likes his

00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:20,980
boat Bodhi that is it is it boaty

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,160
mcboatface floating McFly plays

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,590
something like that yeah and says

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,020
landlubber

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:33,330
okay so the idea is that we pull out

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,330
some key words from the text so if it

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:39,090
has boat in it then the responsible with

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,130
this if it has feel in it then the

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,100
response will be this and we start off

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:48,540
really simply with let's just have a

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,330
really basic conversation slightly less

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,880
basic than the Facebook bots were having

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,870
with each other but but a really basic

00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,270
conversation nonetheless so we're making

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:04,230
sure that they convert to lower so they

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:12,660
can check that words a case-insensitive

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:14,130
and the key phrase is go away so we

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,640
start off with just a really

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:20,160
straightforward while loop and then once

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,360
they say go away it has a series of

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:27,780
print statements shiver me timbers

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,450
farewell name your landlubber and then

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:35,370
we get a little bit more complex so by

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:40,070
the time they get to the last part the

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:40,070
fourth part of this they're actually

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:47,340
doing some kind of cool stuff so we've

00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:53,910
got name we're storing as a variable we

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:56,790
then slice it in occasionally we have if

00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,760
they say I am something then the the

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:02,220
captain will reply with last time I was

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,990
doing that then I went to sail the seven

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:09,410
seas and then eventually when it says go

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:12,810
away the things what the stops and

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,850
you've built this up over a process of

00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,610
four if we just gave them the whole

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:20,430
thing and all of the logic required to

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:23,040
do to make a fun pirate chatbot at the

00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,910
beginning then they that there would be

00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,320
too difficult

00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:31,320
decomposition problem so we we do it

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,450
this way so that they're led by the hand

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,430
and so also the teachers are there by

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:40,820
the hand if we look at the solutions

00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:44,820
we can see that there are teachers notes

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:47,340
let's show how we got there what are the

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,950
steps break it down so that the teachers

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,990
can talk to the students and we've we've

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:56,160
changed the design of this course a

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:59,250
little bit early on so that there are

00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,309
two problems for each new concept rather

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,090
than just one so that the teacher can do

00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:09,000
one on the board and then set the second

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,309
one for the students to do by themselves

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,960
and there's really only a change of text

00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:18,240
at that point okay so that's our that's

00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,190
challenge one there's three others to go

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,070
and explore go to the website

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,400
ATAC a dot edu to au and have a look

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:28,880
sign up for a workshop and hang on a

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,880
second

00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,380
champion teachers are a thing so we have

00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,920
we have a place where you can go and

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,210
offer to sign up as a champion teacher

00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,520
you're at PyCon so you're our people we

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,460
need you to test this stuff out in your

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,740
classroom to tell us what's working what

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,809
would be better if to tell us when you

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,470
want to workshop in your area and maybe

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:01,260
that you'd like to host it - I give us

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,410
feedback to give us ideas for what you'd

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,000
like for future challenges and we'll

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,950
slot those into what we're already

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:16,590
working on and you might get a t-shirt

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:19,290
they're coming okay and finally are

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:22,470
there any questions I have to drop in

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:27,260
some extras Nikki please wave Bruce

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:30,809
please wave these are my fellow ACA

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:34,860
compadres computer education specialists

00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:36,059
and and we're all available for the

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,300
whole weekend

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,330
and today to come and have a chat

00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,800
tell us what's great about Python and

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,340
why you're using it in the classroom

00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:52,700
and just ask us what's going on we'd

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,700
love to have a talk to any of you yes

00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,380
because this is being recorded for a

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:03,750
video if you have a question I will

00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,750
bring you the mic any questions

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:15,339
so Amanda what exactly do champion

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,830
teachers need to do they need to go to

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,080
the website and they have to click the

00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,419
button under champion teachers it's

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,000
really not difficult to find and that

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:28,629
will generate an email that comes to our

00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,030
team and we want to stay in contact with

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:32,530
you so when we start a dialogue then you

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,169
become a champion teacher if you just

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:36,849
press the button and then like disable

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,589
your email account and we can never get

00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,330
in contact with you again there might be

00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:42,550
a problem t-shirts are difficult to

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,980
deliver at that point but but generally

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:50,470
stay in conversation with us be

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:53,260
contacted all and for future projects we

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:56,530
might give you advance notice and ask

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,540
for feedback and get you to teachers are

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,880
very good with the red pen they're

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:06,490
always telling us when we have a typo do

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:09,400
that that's awesome so I know that

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,619
Victoria in its wisdom didn't adopt the

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,780
National Curriculum Wholesale they

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:15,760
decided to make some changes yeah is

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,460
that similar in other states and how you

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,150
sort of going to manage other

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:24,099
differences subtle or they gross how's

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,119
that going to be managed by the ACA I

00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:30,430
guess yeah

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,290
so the National Curriculum is all of the

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,390
points and that's why the National

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,070
Curriculum is a little bit fuzzy it's

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,130
because it was kind of expected that

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,200
people wouldn't just say chunk

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,180
Queensland did Western Australia has

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,070
their own flavor Victoria has their own

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,609
flavor New South Wales is getting their

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:51,550
own flavour but the content descriptors

00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:53,730
of what's required are still the same

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,950
the fundamentals are still the same so

00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,890
we're meeting the content descriptors

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,550
the content descriptors are then

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,359
generally and meant to be

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,240
cross-referenced back into the the

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,560
state-based

00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:11,119
Rick ulam so it all links together and

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,050
yeah the if statements are pretty

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,050
standard any more questions

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:29,360
my question is with regards to the

00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:32,750
Supergirl slide did you head I in my

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,869
experience I've never had Lena's way

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,270
they liked programming and then later on

00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:42,260
they decide that it's not nice anymore

00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,820
or such did you say you've never had

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,030
that experience I have not had that

00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,250
experience yes but I do have an

00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,080
experience way I started programming

00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:55,360
club that's now outside of the classroom

00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:59,660
so I have girls that I'm struggling with

00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:01,910
so what they do is they okay we so we

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,260
have programming lessons and they have

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,570
the interest to come to the lessons

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,700
because they stand up for it but they

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,110
don't stay long enough to actually

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,090
understand the content so in the

00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:14,420
beginning everything is difficult and

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:17,690
they want to quit so I am I want to

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,310
learn from you like how do I keep them

00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,050
motivated because I know that if they

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,420
stay those who stay long enough they

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,950
have programming because the first thing

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,570
is interest in a sign up they have the

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,000
interest but they don't stay long enough

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:32,630
to understand and start understanding

00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,770
how fun programming is so sometimes I

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,010
find it difficult to keep them

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,630
especially their guilt yeah the the the

00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,490
one problem that I see with them is that

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,109
okay fine they they won't do the

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,580
homework because they will come and tell

00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:45,680
you that it was too difficult for them

00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,410
and then sometimes they also don't show

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,840
up for classes so that's also that

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,750
causes it's it's it contributes to their

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,330
whole issue but I want to learn from you

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,869
guys how you keep them motivated because

00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:03,080
I also have another problem which is now

00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:05,990
to keep them patient enough when when

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,910
there are errors and such you know they

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,760
get frustrated and I think it's

00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,800
difficult they can't deal with it but I

00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,690
know how fun programming is because I've

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,790
been there myself it was difficult and

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,380
then it got easier and I loved it so I

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,270
know they will get there

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,430
but just to keep them there long enough

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:28,010
is what I struggling what I'm struggling

00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:30,470
with so yeah I only teach girls and have

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:34,280
it in my teaching career so this is

00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:38,840
something that I face often yearly turn

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,310
Li and I've found in my experience and

00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,980
that's the thing that we're trying to

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:46,310
work with with the ACA is that if you

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:48,050
have the end goal in sight and we do

00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,700
that at the girls programming network as

00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,350
well and and Nikki and I would happily

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,250
talk to you in more detail than any of

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:57,140
the breaks that if they come in in the

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,390
morning and they're they don't know

00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,260
anything and it's going to be hard if

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:05,930
you just say okay here's some theory

00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,230
he's an if-statement practice this

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:13,220
abstract thing then there's no there's

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:18,530
no buy-in so if you say okay we're going

00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:20,210
to make a magic 8-ball game and this is

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,180
how we're going to get there we have to

00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,650
learn how to take input we have to learn

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,290
how to make something appear on the

00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:29,750
screen so these are the steps that we're

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,180
going to take to get to that end goal

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:36,290
that you want to that you want to solve

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:38,450
and in my code Club now the girls have

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:41,930
got to a point where they're they have

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:44,620
just enough to kind of have a future

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,090
vision of what they'd like to do and so

00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,130
where did programmable electronics

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,960
recently and they've decided that they

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,020
want to make a Rube Goldberg machine

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,880
that has some programmable switches that

00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,750
make balls go in different directions

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,120
and so they've defined that end goal and

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,100
so I can then work backwards and say

00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,710
well in order to do that you need to

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,130
make this happen so let's make this

00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,860
happen

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:12,050
and here's the here's the steps of how

00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,000
to do that and then after they've done

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,820
that for a little bit they start to

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,370
decompose their own problems it's it's a

00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,310
long haul but if they can see the end

00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:26,120
point coming out there on the horizon I

00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:29,080
think it keeps them more engaged when

00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,080
they hit those problems

00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:37,250
that's a yes in a way yes so so you are

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:40,820
suggesting that I have liked projects

00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:43,270
already like coded which they can see

00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,550
and then I guess we work our way from

00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:49,900
how you you can create that program or

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:53,960
how well that that's how we do it at gpn

00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:57,290
is we have the tutors develop the code

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,790
to start with and then work backwards to

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:03,430
work out which bits need to be done

00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:08,210
where and then start with hello world

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:11,650
okay thank you okay okay any more

00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:14,210
questions yes another one at the back

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,750
this is quite related but it's not

00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:20,570
related and you're gonna go so I work

00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,280
with people with disabilities I go into

00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,280
a lot of the schools within the Lake

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,350
Macquarie area close to Newcastle and so

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,020
you often find within that geographic

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:33,650
area the NDIS came on board so that's

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,180
going national next year so nationally

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,300
there will be the ability for children

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:42,410
with disabilities and sometimes we're

00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,380
talking Supergirl may have a diagnosis

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,570
of a disability that might be Asperger's

00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,010
are on the autism spectrum yeah and so

00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,140
therefore they've got a great aptitude

00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,420
and what you're doing is wanting to

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,830
foster that yeah and as a teacher it's

00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,100
really hard because you know there's a

00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:00,770
gap and that gap cannot often next year

00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,080
when the NDIS roll out nationally be

00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:07,580
fulfilled not in a school environment

00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:11,480
but in the ability for tutoring in

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,810
regards to code in classes so for

00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,040
instance in our area there's a number of

00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,520
innovative approaches that can help

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,920
support students to be able to build the

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,440
skills necessary or for the person with

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,260
the higher aptitude to go on further and

00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,150
be supported with extra tuition outside

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,890
of the school environment that can

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:37,710
support them with the curriculum if

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:44,170
they're struggling okay great thank you

00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:45,790
oh gosh too many questions thanks

00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,260
so just a quick question Connor right

00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,390
into one of the earlier ones is there a

00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,190
repository of really engaging activities

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,690
that are simple to get started with we

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,490
often find that the kids if they need to

00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,170
learn too many bits and pieces that's

00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,600
why they start to drop out but like the

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,100
mad libs one the magic 8-ball the chat

00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,320
BOTS which are really really easy to get

00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,120
up and going are there places where we

00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,650
can find more of those activities to

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,260
drive that engagement before we start

00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:10,930
getting there some of the harder stuff

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,810
not at the moment but just let me get to

00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:24,190
one the list and we'll make sure that

00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:26,290
comes great question hi my partner's

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,610
currently studying to become a primary

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,880
teacher she's in her final year right

00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,520
now

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,280
and she has taught when she started that

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,560
they were the first year of doing a new

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,260
curriculum at the Uni so it's supposed

00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,600
to be as up-to-date as unity comes not

00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,310
the slightest mention of any of this any

00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,270
way through any kind of computer

00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:51,040
programming related yeah she's not an lb

00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:54,910
but yeah is our the you knees being

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,360
brought along and sorting them to some

00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:02,980
you knees better than others tends not

00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:06,010
to be the the big eight to be honest but

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,680
there are some you knees that are really

00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,500
pushing this I know that I did a masters

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,350
at Charles Sturt and that was trying

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,860
really hard to get teachers engaged with

00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:19,990
this and I know teacher at Southern

00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,210
Cross uni who came from Australian

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,900
Catholic uni who both of those

00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:28,210
universities are pushing it really hard

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:31,300
there are only a couple of universities

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:33,700
in New South Wales that even mention

00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:38,890
technology as a high school discipline

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:42,820
it's it's like where as very much

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:45,700
secondary and so yeah we need to engage

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:49,810
with you knees to to get them to do pre

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,619
service with the future in mind or the

00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,099
cat

00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:56,259
with now in mind yes I suppose the

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,900
problem is how do you actually get this

00:44:56,259 --> 00:45:01,710
across to teachers if not even the new

00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,630
wave you have any of it that's true

00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:07,390
handily the ACA resources are all free

00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:10,569
for teachers so they can get on board

00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:13,509
and learn before the students so they

00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:20,559
feel comfortable before they go into a

00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:21,700
classroom thanks okay okay we're

00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,079
probably not gonna have time for all of

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,660
these but we've still got time for a

00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,099
couple more

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:29,049
ohayo just be really brief just got a

00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:31,420
question around the grog platform that

00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:33,219
you're demonstrating before oh they

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,859
costs around access for that for

00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:39,670
students or ease okay so the government

00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:43,029
has funded is five and years seven so

00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:46,299
for for those courses that we've

00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:48,339
developed they are free for all of the

00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:50,499
country four years five and year seven

00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:52,089
we have to verify that the students are

00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:54,519
in year five and you seven because

00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:57,039
that's the funding model but they are

00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:00,009
accessible to other years at a

00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:02,769
subscription thing yeah and so is a

00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:04,869
whole lot of other stuff I actually in

00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:08,769
my classroom use the croc learning

00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:11,440
platform as a replacement textbook so we

00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:14,950
chucked out the textbook and so now we

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,410
do our web unit using the HTML course on

00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:21,249
grok we do our programming unit using

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:23,499
the Python course and in CSS challenge

00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:26,950
we do the robotics unit based on the

00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:31,420
micro bit it's just insane so I don't

00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:33,700
need flat paper textbook that is out of

00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:37,170
date by the time it hits my desk I can

00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:41,200
use something that's dynamic and that is

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:44,229
interactive and the students can run

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,499
things and see how they work in the

00:46:44,229 --> 00:46:46,499
browser

00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,119
hello thanks for your talk

00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,619
I'm not a teacher I'm a software

00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,869
developer yeah

00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:02,550
what can I do to help teachers

00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:05,400
specifically in the education system in

00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:10,440
general teach computer science

00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:13,800
programming abstraction etc well okay so

00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:18,990
there are some forums that exist for you

00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:22,050
and we love people like you if you watch

00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:24,660
the keynote in the talk tomorrow about

00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:28,890
code club that is a really fantastic way

00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,960
to get involved if you were female then

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,970
the girls programming network would be a

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,390
great place for you to get involved Co

00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:39,859
Club is distributed so they develop

00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:42,359
content but it gets run by volunteers in

00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:44,250
locations all over Australia in them and

00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,730
I'm sure it's the growing to the world

00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:50,010
now and so volunteers in each of those

00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:54,210
locations can take this curriculum that

00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:57,780
exists and deliver it to a bunch of high

00:47:54,210 --> 00:48:02,190
school or younger students and having

00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:05,400
those kinds of skills allow you to be a

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:10,640
better teacher for those students

00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:13,859
there is also CSIRO has a program where

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,290
professionals can sign up and then get

00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:21,420
adopted by a school to help teachers

00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:23,940
directly so that's a cool program there

00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,430
are things out there if you touch base

00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,240
with us a bit later we can come up with

00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:32,990
some more yeah we want your spare

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,990
cognitive load

00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:40,780
okay that is all that we have time for

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,300
for this session because it is morning

00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,770
teatime not going anywhere

00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,300
Amanda will be around to answer any more

00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,150
questions that you have so please thank

00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,919
you man - one more time
