Shh if you see one of the organizers do

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,519

special um we have an amazing talk which

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,010
i think is the star of today lilly ryan

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,600
is going to be presenting star star star

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,670
star star star star a symphony of horror

00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,010
Lily it's a software engineer from

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,899
Australia finding that and following a

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,700
stint as an academic specializing in

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,760
surveillance mechanisms of medieval

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,890
Europe ooh more recent years she has

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,480
seen her teaching practical tech privacy

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,360
to the public giving talks on history

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,960
and the ethics of Technology and

00:00:50,360 --> 00:01:04,290
camouflaging herself in libraries neat

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:10,200
let's make you feel welcome and step one

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,150
is making sure this is on yeah also I

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,890
have a cold so if I have to stop and

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,189
clear my throat and take a drink I'm

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,740
sorry but we'll get there um okay so as

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:26,840
Katie said in longer words I'm Lily and

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,049
this is a horror story about passwords

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,250
and here's my Twitter handle in case you

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,950
wanted to be friends with me on the

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,750
internet which would be nice and drawing

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,790
on good horror stories I'm going to be

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,979
using images throughout this slide deck

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,790
that are taken from the 1922 movie

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,799
Nosferatu

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,979
which was the first vampire movie ever

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,159
made and I'm doing this because like

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,270
vampires like vampires passwords are

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,179
life draining

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,240
they keep me awake at night in terror

00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:03,549
and also because most password policies

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,549
are about as well-written as Twilight

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm also I'm also going to be mentioning

00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:16,129
a few different Django specific packages

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,019
and things in this talk and a lot of

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,230
other blog posts and news articles and

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:23,239
so on and so forth so to save you trying

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,610
to frantically take pictures of anything

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,739
that I'm talking about that you want to

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,060
look up later I've collected all of my

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,769
research and I've put it at this link

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,420
and I'll share the link again at the end

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:35,780
of the talk so don't panic if you miss

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,180
it now but this is where you will find

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,260
all of the stuff that I mentioned as we

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:47,630
go in case you need to refer back to it

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:49,880
okay so if you follow tech news in any

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,430
capacity you will hear everyday about

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,950
databases of username and password

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,459
combinations being dumped all over the

00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,889
place

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,989
usually these news articles will come

00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,150
with heavy uses of the word cyber and

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,850
dark web and probably one of those

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,590
pictures of someone in a hoodie or you

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,450
know a bunch of zeros and ones scrolling

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,829
up the screen with the word password in

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,639
the middle of it all somewhere because

00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:15,560
the ciphers are scary and if you've been

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,269
using the internet for a while you'll

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,120
probably have noticed that passwords

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,190
kind of suck and if you've been working

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,349
in a stock in software for a while

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,799
you'll notice that passwords really suck

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,470
and we all kind of take the presence of

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,690
passwords for granted you sign up for an

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,220
email account you have a password you

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,349
get a new job and you need to access

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,019
your work system it's another password

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,970
and you sign up for Netflix that's

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,290
another password and probably a shared

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,669
password because you'll share the

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,950
Netflix account with everyone in your

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,720
house and so that goes on the fridge

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,430
next to the Wi-Fi password that you also

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,430
probably have hopefully

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,390
and we know that the most common

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,930
passwords are still QWERTY and one two

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,430
three four five six and password and we

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,260
know that most people use the same

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,640
password for multiple accounts because

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,010
it's easier to remember that way and

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,769
then a nonzero amount of people will

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,930
write a password on a post-it note and

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,440
put it on their monitor so they don't

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,549
forget it

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,070
and despite all of the interesting and

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,620
glamorous new software exploits that get

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,410
discovered every day and get talked

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,360
about a lot at things like Def Con

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,100
basic password compromise is still the

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,270
most common way to quote unquote get

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,830
pact restrictive password policies

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:38,340
contribute to choosing bad passwords and

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,160
repeat passwords and the choices with

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,190
how we the choices that we make when we

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,990
store these passwords as database owners

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,550
that contributes a lot to how this

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,580
information gets leaked online or

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,220
whether or not it does and the fact that

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,870
many services still have password

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,539
passwords as their only form of

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,340
authentication contributes to passwords

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:03,210
still continuing to be a single point of

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,220
failure in this whole thing but despite

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,110
being pretty basic in some ways all of

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,550
these things are really important and

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,580
how we got ourselves into this

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,410
particular mess is also important and I

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,820
want to tell you about how we got to

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,389
this point for two reasons the first

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,550
reason as some of you know in addition

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,520
to doing things with code and consulting

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,700
etc etc and as Katie said earlier I'm a

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,220
historian and I'm interested in why and

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,470
how we got to where we are and more

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,520
importantly why we still keep doing it

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,990
to ourselves and the second and probably

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,450
more urgent reason to tell you about

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,840
this selfishly is because I am bored of

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,760
hearing about passwords all the time

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,349
passwords are pretty bad technology with

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,849
several different bad implementations

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,710
and I would rather be doing something

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:54,030
more interesting with my time than

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,870
running around and cleaning up the mess

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,400
that's left by passwords and the reason

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,750
I want to tell you folks about this is

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,450
because we are the ones who can really

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,430
do something about it we're your IT folk

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,950
and your testers and your developers and

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,380
your sis

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,750
admins and sometimes we're consultants

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,610
and sometimes we work in-house and

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,020
sometimes we're the ones who get called

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,300
up by our friends and family to help

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,360
them choose a new antivirus and backup

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,320
their software and so on and so forth

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,630
but we are the ones who have the

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,150
influence in the ability to do something

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,370
about this situation so if you're as

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,190
tired as I am of hearing about passwords

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,040
being leaked and accounts being hacked

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:38,440
then join me in helping to fix this for

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,780
everybody so here is a horrible history

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,670
of awful passwords followed by a list of

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,010
five ways we can stop doing this to

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:50,620
ourselves over and over again because we

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:53,770
deserve nice things once upon a time

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,390
there was a password and this password

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,880
was Open Sesame

00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,320
and it protected a cave where a bunch of

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,110
thieves were hiding the treasure that

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:08,260
they'd stolen there was no two factor

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,940
auth on this cave one day a guy called

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,090
Alibaba was in the neighborhood and he

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,460
saw the thieves saying Open Sesame and

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,020
getting into the magic cave so he

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,060
exploited this by waiting until they'd

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,500
left walking up to the cave and saying

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,120
Open Sesame

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,500
and he got in and he had a look around

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,350
and he took one of the bags of coins

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,300
that they'd stolen he left the cave and

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,920
he went and he bought a new house and

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,910
probably a really cool set of speakers

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,380
and the thieves came after him to kill

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,140
him and to take back the loot that he'd

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,060
stolen that they'd stolen and after a

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,910
protracted and dramatic series of events

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,220
Alibaba killed them all and then he was

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,720
the only one who knew the password which

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,960
is how the first thief should have kept

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,580
it in the first place so that story

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,920
which usually goes by the name of Ali

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,290
Baba and the Forty Thieves is allegedly

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,570
thousands of years old it is at least

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,570
300 years old which is still pretty old

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,140
here's another one there's a little less

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,390
old than that but still a bit older than

00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,520
the Internet

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,920
once upon a time in about the coldest

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,480
part of the Cold War there was a

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,480
president of an America

00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:24,819
this president hmm this president

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,370
decided that the United States stockpile

00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:29,949
of nuclear weapons probably needed some

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,029
kind of controls so that they didn't get

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:37,180
set off by accident or by just anyone

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,709
because that would probably be bad so

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,690
the president asked his secretary of

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:42,310
defense to make that happen and the

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,229
Secretary of Defense made it mandatory

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,880
for there to be a passcode lock on the

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,889
big red button that could make the world

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,230
explode so a video would have to be

00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,940
communicated and entered deliberately so

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,470
to make sure that they were really sure

00:08:51,940 --> 00:09:00,220
that they wanted all of the fallout from

00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:02,529
that decision the guy thank the guy who

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,350
was in charge of Strategic Air Command

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,310
thought it was a ridiculous system

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,110
because it got in the way of making it

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,670
easy to push the big red button when he

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,500
needed to and also because pass codes

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,269
are annoying to remember so he changed

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,769
all the passwords protecting all the

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:17,980
copies of the big red button to a string

00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:19,480
of eight zeros and this is why I'm

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,180
pretty sure we are all living in some

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,620
kind of weird splinter universe because

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,860
we didn't all die

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,660
and because the world survived to make

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,089
more bad password decisions here's one

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,680
more story for you once upon a time

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,760
there was a guy called Alan who was a

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,310
PhD student at MIT MIT had a computer

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,920
and much like my childhood there was

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,540
only one of them and it was in very high

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,880
demand because everybody wanted to use

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,970
it presumably like my childhood to play

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,040
rollercoaster tycoon

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,829
so MIT decided what most parents decide

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,510
which is that sharing is nice and so

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:57,730
they divided up computer time among all

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,430
of the MIT students into several hour

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,560
blocks and to stop people taking over

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,209
other people's blocks of time they put a

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
lock system on the computer so at the

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,089
end of your allocated time you would be

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,930
logged out and the next person could

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:14,079
come and login an Allen had been given

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,000
four hours a week on this computer which

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,410
was pretty good for back then but not

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,750
good enough for the research that Alan

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,060
was doing so here to look around on the

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,199
computer while he was on it and

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,110
discovered the file that kept all the

00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:28,690
usernames and passwords in it this file

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,300
was labeled passwords

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,649
and it was in plain text because this

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,449
was the first time that anyone had ever

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,889
thought of using passwords on a computer

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,759
and they clearly hadn't heard the story

00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:41,889
of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves so

00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,509
Allen printed out the file and then

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,370
whenever he'd run out of his for hours

00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,129
he would just get somebody else's

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,720
credentials and a log on again and he

00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,689
also dumped all of this data for all of

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,980
the other PhD students at MIT to use he

00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,259
handed out copies of the printout

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,579
because he was a nice guy and also

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,839
because if everyone was doing it it

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:03,879
would be harder to pin it on him and

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:08,129
Alan got away with it and people still

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:11,399
get away with it the ancient Greek

00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:14,649
warfare strategist Aeneas tactic Asst

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,800
once said that any good password should

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,839
be easy to remember the login system

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,490
from my bank once said that any good

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,410
password should be between 8 and 16

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,509
characters and contain at least one

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,120
uppercase in one lowercase letter and at

00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,339
least one special character as long as

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,620
that character is at or hash or dollar

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,550
sign not something weird like a tilde or

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,720
something that could break their

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,189
database like a semicolon and passwords

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,149
which use characters with fancy uma

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:45,639
Lotso accented parts or god forbid emoji

00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:49,870
hmm a very bad passwords who will be

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,160
sent to bed without dessert I use the

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,970
past tense there because when I read

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,290
this I switched banks at the point in

00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,550
telling you all these stories is that we

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,410
never really got to this point with

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,959
regard to passwords we have always been

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,490
exactly where we are we just made

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,829
passwords and more and more mandatory to

00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,269
get anything done despite the fact that

00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,699
they were already a giant pain in the

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,680
butt and that's and also that security

00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:15,160
is not something that most people think

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,410
about it all and we all lived horribly

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,180
ever after the end because this whole

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,209
situation is really kind of awful most

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,069
of the time but we know that we can do

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,839
better we enable multi-factor

00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:27,399
authentication on all our accounts and

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,709
use a password manager and generate a

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,449
long password and we know that really

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,920
the length of the password combined with

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:35,110
the unpredictability like a bunch of

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,360
random words in a sequence makes that

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,709
password harder to crack than a short

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,930
non dictionary word with special

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:43,940
characters but not everybody knows that

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,560
and it's everybody else who builds and

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,810
uses the Internet most of the time not

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,870
the people in this room mostly the other

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,460
7 billion so if we want to get it right

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,250
for us we have to make it right for them

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,010
too so here are some recommendations for

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,470
five things you can do we can do as

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:04,730
technical people to make this ever so

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,980
slightly better firstly salt and hash

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,990
any passwords that your system stores if

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,980
you're working on a system that doesn't

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,420
do this please make it do this for those

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,400
are unsure how to do this here is a

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,640
quick overview this is the average

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,950
password someone uses this password for

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,290
an account on your system and so your

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,250
system needs to remember it somehow

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,830
however we don't want to store this in

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,940
plain text or the PhD student islands of

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,030
the world will do what they've been

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,920
doing since the 1960s so we need to add

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,810
some salt which in this case means a

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,160
random string that you add on to your

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,200
password before you store it into your

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,270
system which should ideally be a little

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,400
bit long and it should also be unique

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,750
meaning that you don't use the same salt

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,610
on all the passwords in your database

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,820
and private meaning you don't publish

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,050
this anywhere then before you store it

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,970
you run the password and the salt

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,380
together through a hashing algorithm get

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,600
the output of that algorithm and maybe

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,740
run it again a few times and store that

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,620
in your database this example uses

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,580
sha-256 with only one round of hashing I

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,380
don't know that people have a lot of

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,690
opinions about which hashing either how

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,540
yeah which hashing algorithms are the

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,970
best but there are two overall don'ts

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,090
please don't try to write your own

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,320
hashing algorithm there are plenty out

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,430
there that are very good that we're

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,410
written by people with mathematics PhDs

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,570
secondly please don't use sha-1 as your

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,310
hashing algorithm because even though it

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,240
was developed by people with mathematics

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:34,730
PhDs it is an elderly algorithm and

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,800
insecure by today's standards so if you

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,990
hatch in salt all of the passwords that

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,820
you're storing even if your password

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,820
database gets leaked it will be

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,990
difficult for an attacker to get all of

00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,460
those credentials and use them

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,930
meaningfully because they won't be able

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,850
to guess the password from its hash

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,680
alone and they will also have to guess

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,850
the salt that you used and how many

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,149
times you went around which is

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,500
infinitely more difficult

00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,029
the good news is if you're wondering how

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,880
to do this and you use django django

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:03,399
does this by default instead of having

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,550
to bring all of this together manually

00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,680
django uses pbkdf2 to take care of all

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,959
of the hashing insulting and doing it

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,149
multiple times for you and this is

00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,740
really slow to compute but you want this

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,390
because it also means that it takes

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,880
infinity times longer for somebody

00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,920
trying to break this to do it and they

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,300
don't have your password they don't know

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,200
the password to start with so they have

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,680
to do this for many different

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,510
permutations so and if you don't want to

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,839
use the Django default you can change

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,270
that you can use argon too or bcrypt by

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,160
changing the password hashes setting and

00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,620
in my resources which I again I'll show

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,839
a link to later I've added literally

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,950
just a link to the docs because this gem

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,170
noted this morning the docs are

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,550
excellent and if I explain any more

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,600
about this I would just be reading them

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:52,279
to you another thing that you can do on

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,020
a Django project to help with passwords

00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,930
is to implement a lock out on the number

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,130
of password attempts that people make so

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,230
if someone does try to log in

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,029
maliciously they won't get to try very

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,360
many times and they won't get to hammer

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:07,610
your service with failed requests Django

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,040
axis has you covered there because

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,649
according to their Doc's um also axes is

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,899
used partly because it sounds like

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,279
access and also because access is a

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:20,540
thing used to hack and it prevents

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,579
hacking and one more thing while we're

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,490
here please make sure that your service

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,990
is using HTTPS when you handle login

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,370
requests because it's no good to do all

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,470
the fancy hashing and stuff if the

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:34,370
initial password is sent to you in plain

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:37,149
text in the first place all right second

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,410
thing multi-factor authentication

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:41,300
implement multi-factor authentication on

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,390
every system that you work on that you

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,690
can passwords alone are not enough

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,920
anymore multi-factor all that we need to

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,570
have a password you know something that

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,329
you know and another piece of

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,880
information something that you have

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:57,260
before we let you into your account

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,140
Universal second factor or u2f is

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,860
probably in my opinion the best second

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:06,890
factor authentication that there is so

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,800
that if you can implement it if you can

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,940
implement it support for it please do

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,220
and u2f for those who haven't had a

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,070
chance to work with it yet it requires a

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,780
physical key like a Yubikey and speaks

00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,640
directly to your browser and uses public

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,120
key cryptography to uniquely identify

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,829
you from everyone else and it also

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,959
requires you to touch the keypad on it

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,210
when it prompts you to do so which means

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,490
that even if a bot gets hold of the cert

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,740
there needs to be an actual person or

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:38,270
something with capacitive touch to make

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,850
it work and there's it's also quite hard

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,200
to clone them they're really cool

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,850
there's a lot of very cool stuff going

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,980
on under the hood I put a link to the

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,330
white paper on it in my notes or come

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,500
talk to me about it afterwards because I

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,030
could talk about this for a very long

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,860
time

00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,830
um and yes okay it's a physical key

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,530
which is annoying but you can also use

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,930
this key for lots of different websites

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,490
at once instead of that bundle of RSA

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,640
tokens for every single separate service

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,080
that we all probably used to have the

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,550
other thing that I like about you to eff

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,770
is that it is an open source protocol

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,480
which means that anybody else should be

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,850
able to pick it up limit pick it up and

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,800
implement it and Google does it and

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,020
Facebook does it and fast mail does it

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,320
and LastPass does it and you can do it

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:25,040
too and there are a couple of other

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,830
software token ways to do MFA the most

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,600
common one is T OTP and for those who

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,450
don't know that's a time-based one-time

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,490
password this generates a one-time

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,010
password which is usually about six

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,070
digits long based on a shared key and

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,450
the current time and these temporary

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,390
passwords don't tend to live for long

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,150
between thirty seconds to five minutes

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,220
depending on your config and you can

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,900
deliver this token to user lots of

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,220
different ways you can some people build

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,590
standalone apps there's Google

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,990
Authenticator and a lot of services sent

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,690
oaken's via SMS but I wouldn't recommend

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,030
doing this because it's trivially easy

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,960
for a dedicated attacker to clone your

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:09,200
sim and get a hold of that token and

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,850
attack you if they want to um SMS as a

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,650
second factor delivery mechanism has

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,050
been deprecated by a lot of different

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:19,020
companies and various industry standards

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,970
boards so it avoided if you could but

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:26,210
multi-factor authentication for Django

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:28,289
is really easy yay um Marcus told him

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,320
gave a really good talk

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,580
at Django con Australia last year about

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,640
how to implement two-factor or things

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,610
and he's already done that talk so I'm

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,080
not going to do that talk um I've got a

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,980
link to his blog post about it in my

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,350
references list

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,480
yes but the TLDR of it all is that the

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,570
Django to factor auth contains pretty

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,529
much everything you need to support

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,080
multi-factor or thin your Django app

00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:58,340
that includes you to F and T OTP it's

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:02,070
really cool so go and check that out

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,470
okay third make more than one

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,320
multi-factor option available for the

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:10,140
people who wanted you to F and a

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,360
one-time password plus a password itself

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,299
make things even harder for someone else

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,590
to break into an account and I know that

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,789
there have been a lot of headlines over

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,110
the years about how this all that

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:22,409
technology is going to be the password

00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,450
killer none of them really are we still

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:25,020
have lots of passwords we get more of

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,450
them all the time

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,610
but honestly I think that a combination

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,690
of different factors of various things

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,059
of things you know and things you have

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,429
is probably going to be the way forward

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,390
in this case that we might actually move

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,190
away from something that is

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,299
traditionally considered a password but

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,740
we're still going to have a bunch of

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,720
different factors in some form or

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,070
another

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,770
as a sidenote phrase that we del is

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,309
giving a talk tomorrow I think about

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,480
social identities and federated login

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,220
and this is another approach that is

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,179
helping in the kill password fight or at

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,559
least the reduce passwords right so if

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,179
you want to know more about some of

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,870
these tech some of these technologies

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,529
like sam'l an OAuth and open ID connect

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,059
don't listen to just talk tomorrow

00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:10,980
should be good but in implementing

00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,289
multi-factor the main thing to remember

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,679
here is that even if you turn on all of

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:18,510
the mfa breaking these accounts is still

00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,270
possible nothing is ever ever ever going

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,520
to be 100% secure

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,440
that said implementing this stuff does

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,490
make it an awful lot harder for people

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,760
to try and hack into your users accounts

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:36,020
so please turn it on

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,830
okay poor thing help your clients write

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,510
good password policies and these good

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,160
password policies tend to get rid of the

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,550
special character requirements in favor

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,630
of length a minimum mandatory minimum

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,860
password length and a randomness checker

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,110
strictly speaking the best passwords are

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,370
long and hard to predict it doesn't

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,750
matter what kinds of special characters

00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,590
and numbers they contain it's the length

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,930
that really matters and you usually see

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,350
mandatory you usually see mandatory

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,420
maximum lengths of 16 to 20 characters

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,530
but if you have these in your systems I

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,950
would encourage you to dish these

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,380
entirely if you can longer is usually

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,580
stronger and mandatory minimum length is

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,660
the best way to get people to actually

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,240
generate something more secure with that

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,010
in mind tell your clients about dice

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,690
where passwords by which I mean

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,280
something that looks like this passwords

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,380
made up of four or more random words

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,500
they're easy for humans to remember in a

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,240
sequence but hard for computers to guess

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,670
so this one is an example I generated a

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,910
few hours ago it's a 40 character

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,720
password it isn't a predictable sentence

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,250
it's definitely something I could

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,970
memorize if I really had to but it's

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,290
going to be hard for a computer to guess

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,850
so make sure that your password policies

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,440
support this type of password and don't

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,890
reject it as a week because it doesn't

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,660
have a number or a symbol in it and some

00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,850
password managers will generate dice

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,700
where passwords for you but if you don't

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,530
have one of those I like to think of

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,910
like things that were on the shelf in my

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,440
bedroom when I was a kid and then list

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,760
off a couple of those items or something

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,520
like that something only you would know

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,990
but you can remember really well and

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,160
other people if you've generated I mean

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,620
you need to remember them for some

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,490
reason other people suggest making up

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,930
small stories to go around these words

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,340
but good password policies are

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,160
meaningless if you don't actually bring

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,130
your users along for the ride and using

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:31,160
dice word password dice web passwords is

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,140
also pretty meaningless if you don't use

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,360
a password manager because then they're

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,400
long and you have to remember them and

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,600
then they're going to get repeated so if

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,890
they get stored in someone else's

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,530
database and they're not doing the hash

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,450
you salty thing and it gets leaked then

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,900
it's public anyway despite all the

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,610
things

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,080
to do so this is point for a education

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,580
for any of this that I'm talking about

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,230
to be really effective you need to

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,110
educate people about good password

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,620
hygiene and tell them about password

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,330
managers and by this I don't mean just

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,940
your users but also your friends and

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,700
your family because good password

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,040
practice it goes way outside the scope

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,280
of your work project like this is a long

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,150
term real life meatspace effort more

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,240
than anything else

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,020
gift people subscriptions I'll teach

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,160
them how to use key parts to keep us X I

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,620
think a password managers they're kind

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,320
of like a band-aid on the whole problem

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,660
of passwords they don't really solve the

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,450
fact that we have all of these passwords

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,240
to deal with but as the name suggests

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,910
they do make them easier to manage long

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,580
strings like the ones I'm recommending

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:42,470
really hard to deal with without them so

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,130
this last passed this one password key

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,330
passed dashlane lots of them all of them

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,430
have their strengths and the weaknesses

00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,230
but using any one of them is better than

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,560
none at all so get out there and start

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,120
showing people how to use them back

00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,040
within the scope of your work projects a

00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,870
quick and easy way to educate your users

00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,550
about strong passwords is to give them

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,510
automatic client-side feedback on the

00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,360
passwords they give you when you're

00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,770
signing up or changing them Dropbox came

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,760
up with this this solution

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:12,140
it's called zxc vbn this gives instant

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,180
feedback to users on the strength of

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,130
their passwords and it determines

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,050
strengths based on the length but no

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,420
determine strengths based on how long a

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,250
string would take to crack rather than

00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:26,090
one kinds of uppercase and lowercase and

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,280
symbols and things are in it it also

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,050
contains a dictionary of common words

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,340
and passwords from previous leaked

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,440
database dumps so you can help your

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,480
users avoid those and it's been ported

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
to Python and a bunch of other languages

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,110
it's javascript natively it's all really

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,450
well supported I'm going check that out

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,650
all right point five rethink the idea of

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,840
working on systems that are using

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,840
biometrics as the only form of

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,480
authentication this is the medium length

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,160
form of a particular round of mine but

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,750
the basic thrust of it is that if your

00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,520
password gets compromised you can change

00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,870
it if your finger good

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,900
your fingerprints get compromised it is

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,850
hard to grow new fingers and when I say

00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,260
compromised biometrics can be

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,450
compromised in a bunch of different ways

00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,000
more ways than a straight-up password

00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,430
can passwords get leaked in database

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,750
dumps and on post-it notes but we keep

00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,640
coming up with new ways to steal

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,390
biometric information all the time

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,430
late last year Dobby released software

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,820
called voco this can generate new

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,620
samples of somebody speaking after being

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,140
fed about 20 minutes of speaking data

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,450
from them so I'm someone who narrates

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,400
audiobooks in my spare time and I can

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,860
really appreciate the idea of not having

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,170
to go to the studio for a 10-minute reer

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,460
according of something but I am also

00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,830
someone who works closely with

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,090
authentication software and I can see

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,980
the potential for someone to get one of

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,070
my recordings leaving the recording of

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,920
this talk hi and feed it to voco and

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,920
then have it rattle off my mic of pass

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,780
phrase um and for anyone thinking of

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,250
doing this you won't be able to do that

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,770
with this service or any other service

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,930
that I have that I use but if you've

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,190
given a conference talk or there's a

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,770
recording of you out there think about

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,210
what it's becoming possible with this

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,330
don't enroll yourself in this stuff and

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,830
don't build it into your systems and

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:17,240
there's more good news for a given value

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,830
of good in January some researchers in

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,110
Japan discovered that the average

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,550
smartphone can capture detailed images

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,730
of your fingerprints from up to three

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,260
meters away if the lighting is good and

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,300
this means that you can get fingerprint

00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:32,240
information from any Facebook selfie

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,250
where you throw up a peace sign or steal

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,330
the fingerprint patterns of a public

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,600
figure if they were photographed in

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,430
public and they weren't ring gloves not

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,110
unrelated ly there have been a lot of

00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,970
really cool recent breakthroughs in 3d

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:47,210
printing of human skin which is great

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,920
for many people but it also means that a

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,610
lot of this Gattaca style biometric

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,680
fakery just got kind of real um but

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,740
digital stealing and faking is the

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,330
softer approach in 2005 an accountant in

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,820
malaysia parted company with one of his

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,700
fingertips after the people who stole

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,850
his Mercedes realized that they needed

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,800
his fingerprint has started slightly

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,480
less violently there was the story of

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,050
the six-year-old girl last year he used

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,550
to sleep

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,950
mother's some print unlock her iPhone

00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:20,570
and by herself $250 worth of Pokemon

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,040
toys biometrika looks really cool in the

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,780
movies but the movies are also where

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,290
people get their eyeballs taken out in

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,000
order to bypass it there is a lot of

00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,010
cool stuff about living into the future

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,770
but I don't want to bring this part into

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,870
it so if you're working with a project

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,700
that's thinking about biometrics see if

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,880
there are any other options first before

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,290
you go into this and if you must use

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,420
biometrics make sure that there are only

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,740
one part of several factors needed to

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,990
authenticate because they are very easy

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,460
to hack both technologically and

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,230
socially and kind of literally in

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:58,040
gruesomely six-year-olds can do it

00:28:53,230 --> 00:29:01,630
so to recap sultan - implement MFA

00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:04,400
support u2f enable more than one MFA

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,710
right proper password policies and

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,060
educate people about passwords to make

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:11,950
sure that they know why you're doing

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:14,690
that and say no to standalone biometrics

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,040
again this is the link to all of my

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,330
notes and all of the things that i've

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,760
mentioned here and a few of the news

00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:24,440
articles to prove that yes even the

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,610
Malaysia fingertip thing is true so you

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:31,220
can take a picture and look it up later

00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:33,350
if you need to and okay I know that all

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,060
of these things is all just really small

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,550
things and they're not gonna make the

00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,730
world perfect and they won't make any of

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,020
us completely quote-unquote unhackable

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,360
but they will make the sate of things a

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,180
tiny bit better the more and more that

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,250
each of this tries I would really love

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,680
to write a happy ending to this horror

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:55,300
story of password so please help me do

00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,300
that thank you

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:10,340
well that was sufficiently terrifying

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:13,010
thank you for the blood and stuff that

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,890
you will be taking because things I

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,150
don't know it's a mug yeah you could

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,600
collect lots of stuff you've probably

00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:23,050
already got my fingerprints on that

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,720
thank you thank you very much

00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:27,720
