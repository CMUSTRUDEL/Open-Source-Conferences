okay I hope everybody else had a nice

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:12,269
laugh afternoon tea thank you for coming

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:15,269
back up now we have Edward Griffin who's

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,140
a senior secondary teacher at Caen

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,320
garland College and a number of his

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:31,769
students as he will be presenting on

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:33,630
student directed projects okay works

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,010
awesome hi sir

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,020
oh yeah I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,030
programming Python and student directed

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,840
projects and this is a bit of a nebulous

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,160
speech because there are going to be

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,649
four of us talking at different points

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,469
in time so I figured I would just start

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:51,989
by first having my slides work slides

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,699
work now please slide excellent slide

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,079
working cool I first I figured I would

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,789
just start by doing a quick overview on

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,730
exactly how all this is gonna work and

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,680
then get into it sorry

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,329
basically what I'm here today to do is

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,309
to share some of those successes that

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,610
we've had I can go on college with IT

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,750
education discuss sort of like the

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,479
pedagogy of what we've been doing it in

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,979
garland College so we can sort of

00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,710
hopefully explain where these two sexes

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,540
successes have come from and especially

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,880
cuz it's by con discuss the role Python

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,840
displayed in all of these things so

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,009
firstly I'm gonna be talking about all

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,810
that mm-hmm

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,820
next week we're going to be having how

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,290
Kim and I was like McCoy will be talking

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,710
about their project and they've

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,570
completed which is the automated Python

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,890
powered turret and we're gonna be

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,720
concluding with Dianna mystic talking

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,009
about his project words myths and that

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,259
will be going through exactly what those

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,259
are a little bit later on so first up I

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,200
do kinda just want to give a quick

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,640
overview of how the ITC's a CT system

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,750
works and how we work and go and go on

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
college because there are a couple

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,320
caveats to this that sort of help

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,049
explain what's been going on so firstly

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,079
we separate years 11 and 12 so that as a

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,930
school our entire cohort has made up of

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,090
Jessica eleven and twelve students and

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,649
one of the advantages of this is we have

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,800
a fairly significantly increased cohort

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,540
size so a gagarin college are you

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,040
eleven cohort is 600 students now this

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,870
is actually kind of cool because it

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,400
means we had yet more opportunity to

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,890
specialize we get more opportunity to do

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,060
really weird in different things because

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,630
it becomes easier to maintain class

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,970
numbers we operate under the be triple s

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,090
IT framework which disappeared there we

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,160
go which has around 21 units across a

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,780
number of different course content areas

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,060
and these are the basic things like

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,560
programming robotics game design web

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,850
design and networking as teachers we

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
pick and choose from this framework of

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,960
21 different semester long units and

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,780
basically just put together for four

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,460
years 11 12 and that's how we design our

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,630
courses now what I'm gonna be talking

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,460
about here is specifically the

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,050
programming stream because this is kind

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,550
of like how or where these guys are

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,140
coming from

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,250
we start in your 11 with programming

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,840
fundamentals we assume no knowledge

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,330
coming in we start from complete

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
baseline of programming and the first

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,420
semester is a basic introduction so we

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,370
look at variables control structures

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,540
data structures functions those sorts of

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,520
things it's a fairly traditional

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,780
introduction to programming we followed

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,820
this off with intermediate program it's

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,750
the second semester here 11 this is a

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,070
little bit look at object-oriented

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,570
programming so we look at some

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,820
event-driven stuff this wave love object

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,050
classes relationships we started

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,320
introducing more complex concept like

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,660
polymorphism and we do some of the stuff

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,890
that lets them put together larger

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,360
projects in year 12 we then hit advanced

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,440
programming and advanced programming is

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,880
when you get to start looking at some

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,120
really cool stuff this course is focused

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,610
on computer science concepts we look at

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,870
recursion we look at regex look at time

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,489
complexity we look at probability in

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,930
combinatorics we look at trees and

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,100
different kinds of data structures more

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,410
stuff than they sort of ever been

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,600
exposed to and the cool thing about this

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,390
is we get to look at this or let's web

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,040
design this as we look at this in a way

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,170
that you traditionally wouldn't see

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,420
outside of a tertiary or university

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,769
context and we get to look at that in

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,450
some kind of meaningful or useful way so

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:17,070
in this course students are introduced

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,140
to each of these sorts of computer

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,820
science topics and then they choose one

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,229
that they like to investigate and they

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,760
spend three weeks doing this

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,340
investigation and producing a research

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,070
paper looking at this topic after that

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,080
you

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,700
and then develop an application based on

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,500
that research so they can do something

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,230
cool with the stuff that they thought

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,360
was cool that's kind of the underlying

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:44,410
approach here is just pick a cool thing

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:46,840
and do a cool thing so sorry

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,300
there was one convention um we have

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,410
advanced programming we did run into a

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,620
bit of a problem when we were first

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,210
designing all of this because when

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,360
you've done programming for a year

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,710
already it's hard to find those kinds of

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,180
students who want to advance even

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,140
further and extend themselves even

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,550
further because it's really really

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,520
difficult when this is a very first

00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,440
entry point for IT and you sort of

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,240
expose all this kind of stuff usually we

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,830
would only get somewhere between two and

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,790
four students in an entire cohort that

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,330
would actually be interested in doing

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,940
this and it was really hard to justify

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,240
an entire class of only two to four

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,210
students so it didn't really happen very

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,280
often so we needed to figure out a way

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,880
to get around this and we did we came up

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,620
with a sort of traditionally ad-hoc and

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,830
then slowly built up approach to

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,380
teaching to help solve this problem

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:43,330
sorry we run our classes similar to an

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,140
online course all the material is made

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,760
available online

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,200
and the students are expected to work

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,550
through it all sorry they're allowed to

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,860
access all of that material and work

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,510
through at their own pace we maintain a

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,250
weekly requirement weekly deadlines to

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,750
make sure the students down track but

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,460
the students are basically given the

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,930
week to say get to this point by the end

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,070
of the week here's all the resources you

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,600
need here's week and get help and this

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,100
is what it ends up looking like this is

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,190
Schoology our learning management system

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,660
and basically on the page you would

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,610
access this you would see all of the

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,800
courses available to you you each course

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,090
has a week by week breakdown or a topic

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,650
by topic breakdown depending on who's

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,150
actually teaching the course and then

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,950
all the content is just available to you

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,530
and you work through this it's scaffold

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,390
its timeline to help you get through all

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,460
of it

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,840
so typically students would taste a

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,730
different number of courses see which

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,680
ones they like stick with that one over

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:37,140
the semester and then just power through

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,140
the content now in addition to this

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,900
classes are still held like regular

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,030
classes so we still have our standard

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,050
we're hours away to school but these

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,759
classes are different than all

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,080
traditional sort of directed instruction

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,050
classrooms they're much more like

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,970
tutorials this is the Kenan flip

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,039
teaching in our regard because the

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,660
students will develop the knowledge

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,370
develop their understanding on their own

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,229
they will research this material and

00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,680
then figure it out and have to figure

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,310
that out

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,660
excuse me so that by the time they get

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,039
to the classroom they come to you with

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,919
the problems that they've run into and

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,180
they go I was doing this at home and I

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,919
got to this point I had no idea what to

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,680
do it please please help me

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,030
and so they come into the classroom come

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,740
to these tutorials all sessions and they

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,530
get help with whatever they've been

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,300
running into I found this as really

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,330
helped shake up the classroom dynamic so

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,880
that the students will show up to class

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,099
with a problem that they once solved and

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,660
they will come in and not always

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,310
enthusiastically sometimes quite

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,130
frustratingly but they will come in and

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,740
come to you and say I have this problem

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,419
I need to solve how do I do it and I

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,830
find this quite different from students

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,220
coming into the classroom sitting down

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:54,520
and going teach me because it just it

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,870
it's coming from them now so assessing

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,310
that's not necessarily discussing this

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,090
from a formal assessment standpoint but

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,680
from an informal assessment standpoint

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,970
we have a number systems used to monitor

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,560
student progress so like I said before

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,560
we use a learning management system to

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,030
track their weekly submissions and we

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,080
use quality but any learning management

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,909
system that can track week the

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,840
submissions would be fine so something

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,090
like Google classrooms would just

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,530
equally work as well but one of the key

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,449
things here is our automated feedback

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,919
systems and when I say our I mean Crocs

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,930
so we've been making use of croc for

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,050
quite a long time now and systems like

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:32,380
croc systems like the interactive Python

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,440
textbook basically things that have an

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,000
automated marking system built into them

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,110
things that have good feedback systems

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,959
built into them things that allow

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,459
students to get constructive feedback on

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,850
their successes constructive feedback on

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,550
their failures so that they can get into

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,050
a habit of reinforcing and building

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,880
themselves up without teacher

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,930
intervention and then when they get to

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,720
the point where they are super

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,519
frustrated where they cannot program

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,110
any further they rock up to one of the

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,810
tutorials and they get that teacher help

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,970
and we push them through it so the net

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,529
result of all of these systems is that

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,379
students have ended up becoming more

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:10,339
self-directed and they become more and

00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,240
more capable of solving those problems

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,040
troubleshooting those progress blockers

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,470
that they would usually slam into and

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,959
then it's collapsed in a giant heap and

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,860
I've found that through this process yet

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,529
they're able to figure out how to get

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,180
around that sorry

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,980
Python has played a somewhat critical

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,500
role in actually assisting with all this

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,490
so it was chosen fairly early on that

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,069
Python was going to be the first

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,350
language we would introduce we do

00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:36,449
discuss some C++ and some Arduino to

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,860
give them a taste of the world but

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:39,269
Python is the first language introduced

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,110
and there are a couple reasons why we do

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,339
that one of the Jonas most these reasons

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,170
are gonna be things you are all quite

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,649
familiar with Python is cross-platform

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,779
it's lightweight we're a BYOD school we

00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,970
weren't always a bo idea school and

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,829
being able to say we need this thing

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,529
deployed usually took somewhere between

00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:01,649
three and six months so being able to

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,759
say we would like Python deployed and

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,199
then having a deployed and then not

00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,459
having to worry about getting other

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:09,660
kinds of things deployed to help it

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:12,029
along was really really useful it is

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,980
clean its syntax is clean its syntax is

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:17,040
readable when students read it they

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,600
understand that it looks like words it's

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,600
not confusing and strange and scary

00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,019
you've access to some incredible

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:27,000
libraries that help you do some really

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,809
really powerful things and my students

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,449
today are going to be showing you

00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,949
exactly what those things can pull off

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:33,269
there are a ton of online resources to

00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:34,980
allow you to teach both and allow to

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,990
learn Python so it's easy to sort of

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,970
help troubleshoot those problems and the

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,290
community is active engaging and

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,230
probably one of the better communities

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,790
as I've seen in terms of if I need help

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,759
with something I can just get help with

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,470
something all of these things together

00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,910
gives the power to really extend the

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,809
students and really get them to do some

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,370
absolutely cool things so one of the

00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,509
things we try to encourage and one of

00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,949
the reasons we're here today is this

00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:03,649
whole collaboration and Industry

00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:06,240
engagement thing we get in different

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,769
industry mentors from our local region

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,370
from different academic institutions to

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,589
come in and

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:14,190
workshops with the kids to really sort

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,600
of like get them to understand that this

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,040
is a real world thing what they're doing

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,630
actually has meaning and purpose the

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,570
students are then required to report

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,770
back on that and actually discuss like

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,029
what they've achieved and this is to

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,370
local schools as well as the local

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,529
industry we try to take part as many

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,930
competitions as possible we take part in

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,400
things like geeky because again it's

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,690
more just about exposure and getting

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,420
students to sort of comprehend

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,060
understand this is the world and to sell

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,029
this all works and we take part this

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,240
year in icon which was a very hastily

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,220
taken photo early this morning but the

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,310
idea is to make these things more than

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,850
just assignments to make these things

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,990
projects that they want to do so all of

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,640
these projects all the products they'll

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,800
be showing to you today were born from

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,670
an investigation in advanced programming

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,050
that I discussed before sorry without

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,470
thinking about a practical project

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,029
itself

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,620
they picked a computer science topic and

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,420
then random with that topic so hi Alan

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,470
Isaac take to computer vision that's

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,000
what they thought was cool and that's

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,560
what they wanted to investigate and this

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,180
ended up with a Python power turret

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,470
because shooting things is cool Deon

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,560
basically came to you one day and said

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,880
how does Google Docs work and then after

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,110
some rapid googling we discovered Google

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,330
Docs works through this magical thing

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,670
called operational transformation which

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,890
he decided to investigate and start

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,420
looking at and the result of that is his

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,410
project which is called words myths and

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,620
no we have to talk to you about that as

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,020
well but I have been talking for 12

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,850
minutes now so I would figure sorry I

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,200
figured the easiest way to get you guys

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,760
to understand exactly how this works is

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,970
if the kids come up and do it themselves

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,970
so Isaac take it away

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,720
hello I'm Isaac and I'll introduce me

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,410
and Hales

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,300
project you so man how our project is

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,970
enough come which is mounted on a servo

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,880
motor and it uses two cameras to

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,110
identify people and their ranges using

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,460
OpenCV libraries and yeah we kind of

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,460
chose this because as I've been said we

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,560
got interested in computer vision and we

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,640
like shooting stuff so yeah the same

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,280
pretty obvious to put the two together

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,170
and yeah that's how we got it and when

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,980
we pitched the dead when I got a give

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,280
him a hand because it was very

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,310
encouraging and he you know was very

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,140
enthusiastic about it making the project

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,620
of it was much easier said than done

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,810
and um it's taken a lot of time to get

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,160
to where it is now even now there's some

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,180
improvements would like to make but

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,520
we're pretty happy to just to have it in

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:50,290
a working state um yep so the project

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,090
had many aspects both physical and

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,170
software related our greatest challenge

00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,820
was probably with the software and

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,070
debugging as I'm sure all of you have

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,630
experienced a lot but we also

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,510
experienced some issues trying to get

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,680
the pace of the project to come together

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,330
Python definitely smooth the process of

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,000
putting all together by making it so

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,410
easy to install and use libraries

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,680
without having dependency issues that

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,940
you might get elsewhere um now we're

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,860
really quickly going to run through how

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,300
it works on a more technical level but

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,620
if you would like a very in-depth

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,150
presentation make sure to come to the

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,830
Highland my presentation in the main

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,620
conference tomorrow so we were using

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,300
Hogg feature detection to find people

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,950
feature detection is essentially the art

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,930
of finding the important or distinctive

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,280
parts of the Pichet object but to do a

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,890
well some things got to have to be taken

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,080
into account speed and the ability of

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,490
the descriptor to the SCADA noise and

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,410
also be able to detect the same feature

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,550
in a similar fashion when lighting scale

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,670
rotation or even to some degree

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,930
viewpoint changes between images these

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,260
are the sort of things you look at when

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,120
choosing a better descriptor the

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,790
detection we used is named by its method

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,320
of doing this and describing areas using

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:02,020
a histogram of oriented gradients we

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,730
create that description of an area by

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,760
first going to each pixel in

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,970
image and applying a kernel or moss to

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:15,160
it and creating a horizontal and

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,420
vertical value of gradient of age pixel

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,470
once we've done that we can use those

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,370
two values to create a gradient

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,750
orientation and magnitude and then once

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,220
it's been done for all the pixels in

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,980
area we can create a histogram with it

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,910
which is basically just a graph we then

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,610
normalize the histogram to just discard

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,530
the noise that would be created by

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:46,970
changing the intensity of the light they

00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:50,030
were sitting in oh yeah after we've done

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:54,560
that we basically pass this to a support

00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:58,100
vector machine classifier which attempts

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,800
to classify whether or not you have a

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,870
human or not human and hopefully you get

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,760
something like that

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,760
now I yeah I'll give you the house

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:19,490
good afternoon so in our project the

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,290
whole hog detector finds pedestrians

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,300
which are essentially our targets to

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,250
shoot at now the turret needs to

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,920
determine how far these targets are in

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,660
order to shoot the closest target since

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,360
a regular computer with a single camera

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,300
isn't able to do that we're using two

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,300
cameras this technique of finding depth

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,800
is called computer stereo vision

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,720
essentially two cameras are able to

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,670
create depth perception because an

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,670
object appears stiff at different

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,710
locations in the images taken by those

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,530
two cameras due to the distance in

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,260
between this is also how our eyes

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,150
Pratap's perception look at an object

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,160
with one eye will be different when

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,410
looking with the other eye according to

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,890
computer vision technology this

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,960
difference is called disparity but

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,390
disparity is bigger when the object is

00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,150
closer to the cameras and smaller one is

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,920
further this creates depth perception

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,440
allowing the computer to see distance

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,199
this is a simple example of disparity

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,470
the red dot

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,329
3d points and the squares represents two

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,759
images taken home plus two cameras in

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,679
distance even though this point is

00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,659
stationary it shifts between these

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,350
images due to the distance between the

00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,659
cameras we have decided how we how the

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,059
target will see distance now the same 3d

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,129
object has to be found on both images

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,730
this is where feature detection and

00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:44,919
match matching algorithms are used

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,619
fortunately OpenCV library includes

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,080
those in our project I've use oriented

00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:52,299
fast and rotated brief for feature

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,239
detection and brute-force matter for

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:57,340
matching those features firstly I found

00:17:55,239 --> 00:18:00,309
all the features on both images using

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,539
the old detector and then I match them

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,149
with the PF matcher

00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:06,519
then I use the disparities of those

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,679
points within the targets boxes that we

00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,649
got from the hog detector earlier to

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,629
calculate distances to them that allows

00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:17,049
the turret to find and shoot the closest

00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:19,929
area in our project the use of Python

00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,759
helped us libraries such as OpenCV and

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,669
numpy were available on Python and

00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,989
they're very easy to find and install

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,450
OpenCV library included feature

00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:30,159
detecting and matching algorithms so we

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,769
didn't have to reinvent those from

00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,950
scratch numpy library helped us on

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:39,609
processing images since OpenCV uses

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,799
numpy array is to represent images the

00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:44,529
simplicity of Python was a big factor as

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:47,019
well since its high high readability

00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:50,230
allowed us to code and debug without

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:52,359
much difficulty using OpenCV numpy and

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,359
python i can create an empty image and

00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,100
display which has two lines of Python

00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,989
code shown in the first snippet and

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,090
reading an attached camera and

00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:04,269
displaying a real-time video is as

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,309
simple as the second snippet the

00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,399
open-ended choose your own adventure

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,080
type of project was at first very

00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:13,690
intimidating it took us a long time to

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,389
narrow down what we wanted to do relate

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,580
to computer vision after that a turret

00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:20,980
immediately seemed like a fun option to

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,019
us because the project allowed us to do

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,059
something fun we worked much harder to

00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,570
understand and implement difficult

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:30,730
concepts the skin of course go both ways

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,860
but for us it has allowed us to

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,540
was into new new areas that our

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,570
education would have only touched on

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,620
briefly otherwise the opportunity to do

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,140
that is something that we're very

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,140
grateful for now I pass on to the peon

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,309
hello everyone as you said I'm Dan

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,960
Musick and this is my project wordsmiths

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,120
my project studied the algorithm known

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,130
as operational transformation which is

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,340
something that Google Docs uses to allow

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,990
users to share over a document when I

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,900
started to look into this with Edwin

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,340
when we first googled what it was it was

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,840
pretty daunting because a lot of the

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,700
stuff we found was behind academic

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,590
papers or corporate walls and that leads

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,110
me to the purpose of what I'm trying to

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,059
do with the project I made the project

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,679
open source because I want people to

00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,630
figure out the algorithm from an easier

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,460
standpoint I don't want them to go

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,750
through the same sort of troubles that

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,140
we went through when we were trying to

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,429
install it like when I was trying to

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,160
figure it out and I started to study it

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:36,669
there wasn't a simple guide or a place

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,290
where the algorithm was um so I open

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:41,080
sourced the project on the MIT license

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,090
so other people can improve and work on

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,160
the project it's available for

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,690
installation over pip as well so the

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,330
role of the algorithm is to keep two or

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,190
more users in sync on one document in

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,480
real time

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,549
most people think if you just give a

00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,650
connection to two users and you just let

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,750
them edit freely that they'll be able to

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,919
edit like you would in Google Docs and

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,360
that's initially what I thought would

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,440
happen

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,669
I'll show you visually why this isn't

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,440
the case imagine a world where two users

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,080
on the same document without any

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,700
algorithm in place to keep them in check

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,160
users in this world can insert or delete

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,799
characters which are applied locally and

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,850
then sent to the server

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,309
imagine the document starts with the

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,730
characters a B and C like above them at

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:30,250
the position 0 1 and 2 respectively user

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,160
1 tries to insert the characters xx at

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:38,110
position 1 and user 2 tries to insert YY

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,760
at position 3 you'll see quickly when

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,250
the operations get sent to the server

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
into the other user both strings end up

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,580
at a different place they become

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,220
unsynchronized

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,720
this is the issue which occurs and what

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,580
operation transformation is made to

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,289
solve he was the same example we saw

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,649
earlier where there's a document state

00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:01,110
of ABC and the users are trying to

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:03,179
insert the same characters so operation

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,590
one on the left side of the screen is

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,440
essentially the first users are trying

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,470
to insert the characters X X at position

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,929
1 and then operation 2 is user to try

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,380
and insert the characters YY at position

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,490
2 you'll see that with the algorithm

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,019
they end up in a state where they are

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:24,510
synchronized rather than unsynchronized

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:26,610
and that's pretty much my demo pythons

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,679
impact on my project was quite

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,970
significant it was easy to document

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,590
because it's such an easy to read

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,570
language making it simple by nature so

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,549
we don't have to go very in-depth in

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,870
documentation for it because it's just

00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:44,250
so easy to read using Python also made

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,960
it easy to rapidly develop web

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,190
applications because I can install

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:53,309
libraries such as flask and socket IO

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:56,029
which makes managing complex web

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:58,049
protocols like WebSockets a lot easier I

00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,840
also thought it'd be worth mentioning

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:03,029
that the user-friendly data structures

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,120
that Python gives makes it a lot easier

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,720
for me to understand and implement this

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:13,010
project because a lot of the project is

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,010
involves moving around data in real time

00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,250
in an educational standpoint this

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,110
project has allowed me to go from a

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,389
point where nothing about the web or any

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,769
complex algorithms or any of that I'm

00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:24,870
starting with learning programming last

00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,760
year to a point where can rapidly

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,510
develop web applications and even

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,730
implement complex HTTP and WebSocket

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,919
protocols it allowed me to understand

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,600
how that algorithms work and the process

00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,809
behind researching analyzing and

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,340
implementing them myself I learned how

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,179
to deploy web applications to a web

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,529
server using a virtual private server

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:49,559
more technically I learned how to use a

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,070
basic deployment stack with nginx as a

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,750
reverse proxy and load balancer and

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:57,350
unicorn to run an event let server we

00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,350
have multiple workers

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,270
the future aspirations of the project is

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,540
pretty much to end up in a point where I

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,980
have an active open source repository I

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,690
want a place where operation

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,060
transformation can be discussed improved

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,900
upon learned about rather than hidden

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,100
behind walls and Google I know when I

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,630
was developing it I really wanted

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,450
something that I could just plug into my

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,790
project and study because it was quite

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,610
difficult to understand from Oh Google

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,110
does this it should be documented pretty

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,940
heavily to a point where I was pretty

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,710
disappointed I couldn't find anything so

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,120
I want to get my position as an

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,740
open-source library to a point where

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,680
people can do that and they can learn

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,880
from it also as a side note I'll be

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,270
presenting a more comprehensive talk

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,400
tomorrow

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,450
at the pike on general sessions at 2:15

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,810
if anyone wants to come to that and then

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:55,650
I'll give it back to Edwin for questions

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:55,650
[Applause]

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:04,980
yeah I mean like yeah question questions

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,120
anyone has questions I mean you guys can

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,800
answer the questions - you don't need to

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,370
like so my little brother is in year 11

00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:18,300
at the moment comes home with IT work

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:20,010
and quite frankly it's depressing so I'm

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,310
just wondering what is it that enables

00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:28,590
you guys to actually do justice to our

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:30,930
tech focused curriculum accommodating

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,910
heads of department is a good stop that

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,050
let me basically say hey this is a

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,400
quality it please let me do this cool

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:40,410
idea and they say sure whatever

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:44,160
girlfriend but basically access to

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,540
resources I started running this whole

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,300
we're not running but I started as part

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,820
of this whole IT doing new stuff venture

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,490
with having never looked at Python

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,910
before and my prep for entirely teaching

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,800
a new group of guys Python was grok I

00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,450
basically did the intro to programming

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,310
one into programming Tujunga rock and

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,840
said that was really really cool and

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,970
then delivered that to my students and

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,440
then one day my students came to me and

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,490
said this is a cool idea how do I do

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,120
that I said I have no clue let's go and

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,970
basically yeah I found that being really

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,410
open with the fact that my students will

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,860
surpass me no it's quite quite rapidly

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,360
and being willing to just sit with them

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,890
and go if I don't know how to do

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,180
something I google it and then figure

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,260
out how to do something or at least I

00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,840
figure out what I need to do at that

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,610
exact time that I need to do it showing

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,020
them how to do that so that they can to

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,450
get to the point where they can do cool

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,830
stuff they might not know exactly how

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,660
all of the cool stuff works but they can

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,140
do cool stuff and that energizes them

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,820
and invigorates them and then yeah just

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,440
letting them do that over and over again

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:53,030
until they understand everything

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:54,710
well everything they want to I I

00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,750
understand that the the projects were

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,520
we're done over three weeks I just be

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,200
interested here from the students how

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,730
much time they put into those projects

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,730
[Laughter]

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,610
too much yeah there's a lot of late

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,510
nights I think you would have seen one

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,010
of the photos there I look basically

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,240
like a zombie and I think it was because

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,320
it's probably 2 a.m. and it was the

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:24,080
first time I managed to get the damn

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,970
thing to work in terms of officially we

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,190
have four hours worth of class a week

00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,180
four hours expected study outside of

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,310
class a week's and eight hours per week

00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,960
themselves and then on top of that

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,610
because we run our classrooms like

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,810
tutorial style sessions a teacher is

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,310
just in the classroom at any point in

00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,470
time so if they need help they come in

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,600
and get it and so these guys

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,320
specifically would generally spend all

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,970
of their free time in my classroom so

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,200
because there were a lot of times when

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,460
it that would freak out and need help

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,650
and then I would just look at it and go

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:56,030
I don't know let's Google that um and

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,460
sort of solve the problems that way but

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:03,950
um yes I would imagine many many hours

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:06,680
were crammed into those three weeks this

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,260
is for the boys I teach senior students

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,350
and getting them to take big risks and

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,610
do stuff that's scary and hard is is

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,220
really really difficult

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,350
what made you confident enough to do

00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,540
something that you had no idea how to do

00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:23,110
and I just wanted to solve an

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,110
interesting problem

00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,950
[Music]

00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:33,799
it was mostly because we we be nice I

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,389
picked really interesting topics like

00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,659
making a turret and shooting people

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:40,610
that's really good

00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:43,399
also we really just get a lot of help

00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:48,889
from the teachers when we need to so I

00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:51,799
guess that's how we did it you don't get

00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:53,989
that much help well I don't really have

00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:56,389
like an answer as to like what motivates

00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:57,710
us but it's sort of we have to study an

00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:58,820
algorithm we're gonna want to find

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,619
something that we want to spend the

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,210
whole year working on however long we've

00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:03,200
been given to be working on we don't

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,940
want to be working on something that

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,619
doesn't look cool it doesn't excite us

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,549
and I guess they make it clear to us

00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,899
that you want to be able to enjoy it

00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:10,639
while you're working on it and so I

00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:13,159
guess that's what we look for something

00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,989
interesting I think that's about marks

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,629
more about what I think will be cool to

00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:26,859
create I feel like that's with most of

00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:26,859
us in the class any further questions

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,210
as quick question about the nerf gun how

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:44,730
did you interface our Python with your

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:53,970
Arduino apparently it doesn't want to at

00:29:44,730 --> 00:30:12,780
all we use the serial port with PI

00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:16,370
serial I wanted to comment on something

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:18,660
that I heard from a lady in the front

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,120
sorry that I don't know your name but

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:24,030
it's with regards to the difficult like

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,850
being bald enough to have to have come

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:30,540
up with such you know great projects for

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,730
Alana's and I think that mainly it's not

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,330
about how bald they are how bald the

00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,280
teacher is it's mainly the teacher

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,990
giving them confidence because at all

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,170
times the Lina's are going to be afraid

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:46,410
they won't know what's ahead so if I

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,380
have the teacher is able to expose them

00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:51,240
as much as I can maybe take them to

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,620
conferences like this just so that they

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,090
know you know what's out there because

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,580
they won't know what's out there until

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,190
they exposed and then you just starting

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,400
because if you start teaching them

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,840
programming for example later on they

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,730
start coming up with the ideas and

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,130
eventually they will be confident enough

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,960
to have you know great projects so

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,610
mainly is just introducing them and

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
keeping them interested in keeping them

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,420
lending you know and then eventually

00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:21,300
they will come up with great project

00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:23,730
ideas like that's all we have time for

00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,010
so Thank You Edwin thank you boys thank

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,070
you

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,070
