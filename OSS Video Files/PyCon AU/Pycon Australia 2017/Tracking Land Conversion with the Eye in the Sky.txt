	00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:13,080
so for this final session before the

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,420
afternoon tea in sighs and uh we've got

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,100
Byron Allen and he's gonna be talking

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,970
about tracking land conversion with the

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,270
eye in the sky

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,769
thanks Bob thank you thank you everybody

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,840
for coming and hearing me speak so I am

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,840
a data consultant I work for a company

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,750
called Serbian based in Sydney and we

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,940
have offices around Australia but so

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,230
that means my day-to-day job is kind of

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,890
more on the data engineering side of

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,789
things but I in my spare time

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,809
I play around with satellite images and

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,760
this particular talk spawns from a data

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,199
science course that I took at General

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,230
Assembly so I was doing their bootcamp

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,149
and as a part of that you have a final

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,940
project and that's where this talk

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,250
started but it's kind of evolved into

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,110
something a little bit beyond what I

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,740
initially did and I kind of want to talk

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,430
about that today so land conversion when

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,290
I say land conversion I'm gonna talk

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,850
about it in a more specific context and

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,159
I want to go through what that is and

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,400
why I think everybody should be aware of

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,750
it then I'm going to talk about

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,240
satellite images how you might go about

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,119
acquiring them and the tools that you

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,860
might be using to manipulate them the

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,380
next thing is a little bit of context to

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,430
understand my specific topic there's

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,500
definitely some things you need to know

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,770
otherwise it might be kind of hard to

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,630
follow what I'm saying then the next the

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,210
last two parts of the presentation will

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,640
be about my first project and the

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,070
failings of that first project and what

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,340
I went or how I went about improving it

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,420
so land conversion what do I mean when I

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,560
say land conversion

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,570
I think everybody's heard of

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,329
deforestation and this image is from the

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,820
Amazon probably relatively familiar to

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,040
everybody I know it's very familiar to

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,960
me I learned about the deforestation

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,759
when I was in third grade our class did

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,009
this little project where we did like a

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,750
paper mache rainforest and we wrote a

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,550
letter to President Bill Clinton asking

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,290
him to help stop deforestation and

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,400
from from that point on it really stuck

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,810
in my mind and I always kind of had this

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,130
this idea of conservation as being

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:28,160
something I wanted to be a part of and

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,470
fast forward 15 years and I'm doing this

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,850
data analysis project around the

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,010
Renewable Fuels standard

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,500
now the Renewable Fuels standard is a

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,870
piece of legislation in the United

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:44,780
States that requires refiners to add X

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,910
amount of biofuels into their gasoline

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,040
at an increasing rate each year now this

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,610
has questionable ecological and

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,410
economical impacts and as you can

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,910
probably tell corn is the prominent

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,800
source for those biofuels in the United

00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,630
States and so that's where cropland

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,510
comes in and that's why I was interested

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,040
in land conversion because ok well if

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,280
we're gonna go from wild lands whether

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,620
it's grassland or forests and convert

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,620
them into cropland how might that impact

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,180
climate change the ecology in general

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,110
and one thing that I found very

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,440
frustrating

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,680
in that analytics project was that there

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,600
is a severe limit on the amount of data

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,690
that I could get there was only one year

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,170
of publicly available data that spoke to

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,480
land conversion in the United States

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,990
which was ultimately very disappointing

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,060
at the time but I realized it might

00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,300
actually be an opportunity so when it

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,370
came to the final project in my General

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,140
Assembly data science course I realized

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,020
this might actually be an opportunity

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,310
what if I could use satellites and the

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,980
machine learning methods that I was

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,260
learning through the course to create a

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,280
record of that land conversion of that

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,580
change from wild land cropland so I went

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,510
about investigating ok how do i leverage

00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:12,080
satellites satellite images to to create

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,310
this record and the first place you're

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,040
going to probably start if you're gonna

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,230
go down have that conversation is where

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,940
do you acquire those images and there

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,500
are a lot of places but I found one of

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,389
the easiest was this Google Earth engine

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,479
which is a browser-based IDE

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:33,379
built for research and unfortunately

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:35,060
it's mostly in JavaScript but it does

00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,719
allow you to very conveniently and

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,789
quickly define a geographic location and

00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:44,240
export the rasterized images so like a

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:46,240
geo TIF file for example so that was a

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
very quick way of acquiring those

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,629
satellite images that I that I needed

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,930
for my analysis so the next question

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,759
then becomes ok you know where to go to

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,919
acquire the data but you have many

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,330
satellites to choose from and if you

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,250
look at this space from a broader

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,900
perspective there's private satellites

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,289
and there's public satellites there's a

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,960
lot of data out there to get your hands

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:11,449
on there are some publicly available

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,029
sources such as the Landsat series which

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:15,949
have been around for several decades

00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:19,610
Landsat 8 in particular is what I use

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:21,979
because it had the most recent years so

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,870
it was launched in 2013 and I was

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:30,080
looking from 2013 to 2015 and so I went

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,919
about using Landsat 8 data so the one

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,319
thing I had to bear in mind was Landsat

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,710
8 orbit and this would be true with any

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,349
of these satellites --is when it orbits

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:45,080
it orbits in near Earth orbit and Earth

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,779
will spin which means that the satellite

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,210
only covers the same piece of land

00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:53,270
roughly every 16 days so you end up with

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,339
an image of any given location so like

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,979
Melbourne for example will only appear

00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:03,949
in the record once or twice a month and

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,839
so I had a good a sense of the frequency

00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,210
of the data what what kind of data I

00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,069
would be accessing and then it came down

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,689
to okay well how do I manipulate this

00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,610
data and I think probably a lot of this

00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,879
will be very familiar to many of you so

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,969
the typical data science stack like

00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,159
pandas numpy psychic learn those were my

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:24,979
goatees but there's also this more

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:26,360
modern GIS stack that I think is really

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,599
valuable if you're interested in

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,229
exploring this space such as R a stereo

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,629
Fiona shapely in particular I use raster

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,819
a restaurateur wrasse stereo however you

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:40,789
want to pronounce it I went to that and

00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,930
that's a really useful way of accessing

00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:48,069
the contents of go2 files which is what

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:50,449
Google Earth engine was spitting out so

00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,400
here's a few examples of rest area and

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:56,000
what you could get from it I'm opening

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,340
this geo TIF file and I'm able to access

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,439
the number of bands and some metadata

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,030
around height width and other

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:06,500
information that might be useful for my

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:08,030
analysis another one would have been and

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,889
this is one that I widely used was

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,000
accessing the specific bands themselves

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:16,460
so you would say if you needed to access

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,050
your blue red green or infrared for

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,319
example you would specify it in this

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:26,870
manner and you could very quickly grab

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:29,930
those layers and then Rosario also

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,000
enables the ability to write out into

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,979
geo TIFF which was quite convenient and

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,840
that's really only tipping the touch or

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:40,430
the tip of the iceberg for raster IO and

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,689
if you really want to get started in

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,710
this space if you haven't really

00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:46,509
explored it yet

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,830
there's these two tutorials that I

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,029
started messing around with I went

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,620
through when I was getting into the

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,169
space and I found them really

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,219
influential I'll put them up on the

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,440
select channel after this so okay it

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,500
kind of gives you a sense of where to

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,050
get the data and what tools you might be

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,229
using but what do you need to know about

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,349
this my specific topic so there's this

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:16,069
thing called center pivot irrigation and

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,819
it's a way of irrigating cropland where

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:22,069
it's this boom that pivots from a

00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,949
central point and waters Lin what that

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,330
does is that creates these kind of crop

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,000
circles so it's an easy way of

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,199
identifying cropland as you can tell

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,770
there's these little green circles

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,490
everywhere

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,870
dotted throughout the landscape so it

00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,010
throws some people often they see that

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,140
for the first time because they don't

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,990
know what they're looking at but it's

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,810
something to bear in mind and another

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,230
thing that will be helpful in terms of

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:52,970
providing contacts is Landsat 8 provides

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,750
a series of multiple frequencies in the

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,540
electromagnetic

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,550
spectrum but for when you're looking at

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,290
vegetation there's three in particular

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,890
that are going to be really useful so

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:07,070
your your blues your reds and your knee

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,950
room for red and together those would be

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,900
combined and push through this algorithm

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,690
that's enhanced vegetation index

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,140
algorithm and the output is very useful

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,970
in identifying vegetation so not

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,220
specifically cropland but if you look at

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,560
that image you start to see those

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,510
circles again in bright pink which is to

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,770
say that they're they're showing up very

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:32,510
prominently in this image so but when

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,730
you get that enhanced vegetation index

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:39,020
really what you're looking at is very

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:42,050
it's unlabeled data so that would lend

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,230
itself towards an unsupervised method

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,120
you would want to cluster or label or

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,940
ultimately infer groups you'd want to be

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,050
able to say is this pixel cropland or is

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,110
it something else

00:09:51,050 --> 00:10:00,350
is it vegetation is it forest is it

00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:04,550
desert etc and so for me I chose k-means

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,560
and it is probably one of the more

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,810
simple clustering methods to understand

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,620
one of the more simple ones to implement

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,120
it scales well with large data and it

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,540
labels all your rows so unlike

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,540
algorithms say like DB scan which might

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,350
drop some of your outliers this will

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,620
label every single row in your data set

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,750
so this is that was one of my starting

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,570
points and that kind of brings me to the

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,550
first method that I took in approaching

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,350
this problem of trying to identify and

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:41,450
track land conversion so I took that Evi

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,860
that enhanced vegetation index and I

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,660
started looking at the distribution of

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,580
that data and what I often saw

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,950
especially in an image where it was a

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,800
mixture of cropland a non cropland is

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,630
this bimodal distribution and I noticed

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,280
that if you look at that right

00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:00,620
distribution you you can kind of crop

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,850
that off and you get this impression of

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,440
a cropland

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,930
now that's really simple that's not

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,490
particularly a sophisticated way of

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,709
identifying cropland but

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,660
I noticed that and I kind of cut that

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,480
and kept it to the side and I called up

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,880
my agriculture mask the next thing I did

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,839
was I tried to go about creating my own

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,899
vegetation index which is it was it was

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:28,089
a good effort but I think in retrospect

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:31,850
Evi is still very strong at identifying

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,950
vegetation so in any case I went ahead

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,010
with my vegetation index clustered on

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,709
that and then I would overlay my mask

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,920
with those clusters to kind of do a

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:46,040
cross-check and then consolidate those

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:50,060
labels to identify cropland and non

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:54,700
cropland so I did this for a piece of

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,839
land in Nebraska which I knew to be a

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,029
mistake in the United States it had the

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,130
highest amount of land conversion in

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,589
2011 so it was a good place to start and

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,620
so I took this piece of land

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,089
I took a raster image of it this is what

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,190
it would look like in natural color and

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,899
then when I put it through my method it

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:16,010
would come out like this and you'd have

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:19,130
cropland and orange unsure and blue and

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:21,800
the non cropland in green which is

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,750
really quite it was good and made me

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,360
really happy when I first saw this but

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,510
it was still it seems somehow very

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,029
simple I could tell that you know there

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,630
was sort of this dip in non cropland

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:38,200
over this 2013 to 2015 period and

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,160
there's a little bit of a rise in

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,640
cropland but it kind of leveled out and

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,500
there's this unsure element so it really

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,390
raised a question how do I deal with

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,850
this unsure element how do I deal with

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,910
this unknown and I realized there's two

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,240
ways of going about this problem is to

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,680
do a better job at capturing the nuances

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,010
and the different types of landscape

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,560
that you have or use some kind of a

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,870
probabilistic model so I've heard of in

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,390
carbon accounting a model that is

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,220
probabilistic but that works for carbon

00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,709
accounting because if you're looking at

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,310
the Evi this enhanced vegetation index

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,320
you have something on one extreme it's

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,150
it's very binary so you have vegetation

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,440
or it's not and

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,640
that's what you're looking at when

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
you're looking at carbon accounting but

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,350
if you're trying to identify cropland

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,140
versus non cropland it's a bit more

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,020
nuanced so in trying to improve my model

00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,730
I what sought this method of trying to

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,580
identify different types of land cover

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,880
so I realized I needed to increase the

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,260
number of data sets that I was active

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,360
our samples I was actually taking

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,839
because I was only taking a sample from

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,839
the peak growing month of each year so

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,850
one of the core tenets of this improved

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,750
model that I've tried to work on was

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,810
taking a sample from each month and then

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:05,510
off the back of those twelve months

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,040
well first off in those twelve months

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,420
you can kind of see that from month to

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,839
month

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,390
it changes agriculture changes crops

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,750
cropland disappears because it grows and

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:20,300
it gets harvested and so doing feature

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,770
engineering off the back of those twelve

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,050
months could be really valuable in

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:27,050
understanding where copper island is and

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:30,260
you can see on the Left there's an

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,550
annual standard deviation it's quite you

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,580
can see the crop plans it's quite

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,589
prominent in that image and that's not

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,700
actually a direct image that's standard

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,980
deviation when I first saw that I was

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,190
really thrilled because what that means

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:46,400
is you're capturing that nuance across

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,980
12 months so to me it felt like okay I'm

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,279
on the right track so what I did was I

00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,870
continued to do feature engineering and

00:14:52,279 --> 00:15:00,890
I created a total of 67 features for my

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,410
data set and taking means and sums and

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,589
standard deviation variation differences

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,060
from this month this quarter and just

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,550
trying to get as much as many features I

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:16,310
as I could I then took that data set and

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,920
spun it through a morphology algorithm

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,279
which effectively smooths the algorithm

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,440
so sort of like smoothing time series

00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,540
data if you will it's like a rolling

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,180
average but for images and you can see

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,070
that on the left in the left left image

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,530
it's kind of splotchy and it's a little

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,769
bit unclear but in the right image that

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,290
has

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,850
morphology applied to it it's a little

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,679
bit more clear it's a little bit easier

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,209
to understand so when you go for a

00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,279
visual inspection of the data which

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:46,579
you'll do a lot because it says you're

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:51,049
handling images it's a little bit more

00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:54,369
clear so going back to k-means I so I

00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:56,839
have my morphed 67 featured data set and

00:15:54,369 --> 00:16:00,069
with k-means you have to figure out okay

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:04,100
what's the ideal number of clusters and

00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:05,929
this becomes one way of approaching this

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,540
is using silhouette scores which you see

00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:10,129
on the left and your idea of silhouette

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,059
score is one and you can see that there

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:15,949
are some number of clusters where the

00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:19,369
ideal silhouette squares may be closer

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:20,929
towards like six clusters and then on

00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:23,689
the right hand side you can see it's

00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:26,329
like 26 clusters and there's a very high

00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:28,699
silhouette score but the issue is too

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,439
few clusters and you don't capture that

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:33,759
nuance I'm it's going to be harder for

00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:37,160
me to get to those the different

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,170
topology that I'm after too many

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,449
clusters and I'm just gonna get lost in

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,939
clusters and I'm gonna have a hard time

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,100
discerning what's what so I tried to

00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:49,249
find a middle ground which is why you

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:55,759
see that annotation around between 11

00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:58,220
and 14 so once I took my new feature set

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,490
and applied it through that method and

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:04,639
found my number of clusters that I

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,470
wanted to use this is what a data set

00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:08,419
would come out with like and what I'm

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,279
really doing here is trying to go for a

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:12,409
ground truth and you can see that

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,130
there's a far greater amount of nuance

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:18,579
than that first graph that I showed you

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:21,169
you can see that there's crop and orange

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,600
spotted throughout you can see different

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:25,429
types of vegetation throughout the map

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,620
and then there's this final one which I

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,389
thought was really quite interesting

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,460
where it's actually vegetation along the

00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:33,200
river and you can see that it's helping

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,539
to identify where the river is to a

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,399
large extent which I think that that was

00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,080
really promising for my perspective

00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,190
because it said ok you're starting to

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,340
get to a point where you're capturing a

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:46,639
greater amount of nuance and all of this

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,539
really goes to a ground truth you want

00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,639
to be able to identify

00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:51,529
by your ground truth what is actually

00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:55,190
there because we're trying to late put

00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:57,580
labels on nature and nature is not

00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,929
exactly well-defined you know when does

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,720
forests end and when does it begin

00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:06,619
so did I find the best ground truth

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,710
method I hope so and one of the ways I

00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:12,259
wanted browned testing diagram truth

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,919
method is taking it from Nebraska to

00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:17,749
Florida to this area where in green you

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,940
see a lot of what land right next to

00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:21,590
cropland so you can you start to see

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,869
there is this difference even though

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,820
both who have all a lot of vegetation

00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:30,979
you can certainly discern the difference

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:33,169
between the two of them so I'm finally

00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:35,479
getting to a stronger ground truth and

00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:36,979
that's really important because the next

00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:39,710
step of this entire thing is you can't

00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:41,450
keep building this ground truth for

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,759
every single location that you find if

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,849
you wanted to say do a map of Victoria

00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,429
in this way you would be leveraging a

00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:51,830
lot of data and it would be quite

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,869
time-consuming but the ideal solution to

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,659
get to is to go from this ground truth

00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:59,690
and use that ground truth to build a

00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,429
supervised model and then you can start

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:06,470
to spit anything through a supervised

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:08,989
model and predict the outcome so am I

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,940
done only with this presentation but

00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:13,059
hopefully not with this project so thank

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,059
you

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,370
thank you rich bar and again yeah I gift

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:30,080
as a token of my appreciation

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:33,380
thank you have any questions we noticed

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,330
that you use like a number of features

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,950
would you be able to share further on

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,110
how you are getting the features and how

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,480
did you do your feature engineering side

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:50,780
yeah so I can go back to it

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,640
so for example look at all if you look

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,210
at all the standard deviation ones to

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,830
STD I just took it from each quarter did

00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,659
it for the entire year did it for a

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,909
summer period for half a year I think

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,350
with future engineering the thing is if

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,400
you're really doing that you don't know

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,840
where you're going with it

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,110
you don't know what feature is going to

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,270
be good and useful so you just keep

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,539
engineering as many features as you can

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:16,460
and you do it as you know you create

00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:25,100
that data set as wide as you can and

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:27,049
hopefully something sticks yeah here in

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,580
Australia there was a project to create

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,690
something called the I think it's the

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,220
Geoscience data cube way they did have

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,980
you know they made Landsat data

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,179
available and they also tried to like

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,640
predict that you'd want to analyze it

00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,799
over time so you do time series analysis

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,500
but it looked like from your talk were

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,380
you kind of happy to just get rosters

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,610
from something and then do all your own

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,500
post-processing or you know did that

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:56,990
sort of work for you any comments on

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:59,990
that so I mean I guess what I did was

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,780
this initial data discovery phase and I

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,100
haven't like productionize this at all

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,230
I think that's something I would be

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,230
building up to because I would love to

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,980
do that if I could and cover other

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,080
topics

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,400
besides sale and conversion so land

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,330
conversion is kind of like close to my

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,640
heart because I'm a bit of

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,710
environmentalist but there's a lot of

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,179
other issues out there that could be you

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,450
could apply this method in a very

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,190
similar way it does that quite answer

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,610
your question I guess because I'm like

00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,260
you didn't trying to get out did you

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,270
what was sort of main data

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,760
representations did you work with I saw

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,130
you had a data frame at one say twenty

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,480
green your images so was it mainly you

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,950
didn't do a lot with the rosters

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:46,679
themselves you got things into yeah so I

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,410
was really just taking rasterized images

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,850
and then putting them into num peak so I

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,620
think you know that was the most

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,280
convenient and easy way for me to do

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,570
that at the time I think that's the way

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,240
I would I would continue to go forward

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,190
with it is open those raster images up

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,980
and then go for it one thing though you

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,530
know you can use raster raster IO to say

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,540
take that image like this one for

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:11,490
example and then pump it back out and

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,590
you could put this into a similar format

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:18,620
they would where you could apply

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,620
metadata for other like proper mapping

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,480
what's next do you have any plans for

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,460
the probabilistic programming you

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,420
mentioned on tracking uncertainty you

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,830
are well I guess that's yeah so the

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,350
thing is to start applying this to

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,110
different regions and different areas

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,720
right no it's it's not the same type of

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,400
topology as say that area in Nebraska I

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,930
want to check on their areas and then

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,300
you build up those land type

00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,920
classifications and then I think it

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,620
would be the idea would be to combine

00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,590
them into a giant a training set and

00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,130
then move on to some sort of developing

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:05,640
some sort of supervised method to follow

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,920
up on it on a separate note there were

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,190
you using time series data for a couple

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,170
of years at every 16 day interval to

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,600
create all your features no I was taking

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,220
one sample from each month look says I

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,950
wanted something to represent each month

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,560
okay and so with that do you just get

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,630
like one sample in summer or just a few

00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,910
the three or four months that happen to

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,770
be in each season so do you see seasonal

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:31,050
effects particularly Welford crops I

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,930
think that's kind of what I'm trying I'm

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,910
banking on in those feature and creating

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,490
those engineered features is that there

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,290
will be those changes and that in doing

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,290
feature engineering that captures those

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:48,470
changes you can create a model that's

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,470
more informed okay thanks

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,470
I am maybe it has missed your

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,580
explanation but when you actually

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:01,049
clustering man standing is that actually

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,360
clustering of the different values with

00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,679
the intensity of the AVI

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,669
Balaji were getting from the data is

00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,799
that what you were doing just to just

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,019
quantize the intensity values is the

00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,460
right correct yeah okay and then the

00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,080
other question is I think we were trying

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,639
we actually were wondering here with my

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,990
colleague yo when you actually selecting

00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,429
the features you did it by hand or you

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,889
actually just run some algorithm to

00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:22,350
select the features based on some

00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:23,190
criteria where they selected the

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,440
features like you have you all the

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:28,350
different variances and yeah so I built

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,510
it out and you mean like some sort of my

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,830
future reduction yeah yes but you

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,510
actually just used some that's all I

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,370
think I've thought about exploring a bit

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,440
more like using a principal component

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,730
analysis to reduce the feature set at

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,010
the moment I haven't really reduced it

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:48,179
so just hand peeked yeah it's just that

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:50,399
wide data set thank you yeah I mean it's

00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,169
just a pretty simple question how do you

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,889
deal with cloud coverage when you got a

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:58,200
set of a lot of photos stuff yeah that's

00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:59,760
a that's a good one I think I've kind of

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,740
resigned myself to accepting that it's

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,380
gonna be there and you have to work

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,659
around it to some extent and I think

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,419
there's there's value in taking 12 like

00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:12,960
a sample from each each month and that

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,630
you kind of reduce that the impact of

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,220
clouds but yeah it's it's a little bit

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,830
unavoidable to some extent you can't

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,600
like remove clouds completely you just

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,899
have to bear that in mind

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,610
and you know if builds like so I'm

00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,710
building ground throughs I think it's

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,990
ideal that you picks that I pick areas

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,419
where there's minimal cloud coverage

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:36,559
throughout my samples that's basically

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,559
what I'm done

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:45,489
thank you nice talk to build your time

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,799
series how did you line up the pixels

00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:49,809
from one month to the next to know that

00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,019
you were looking at exactly the same bit

00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,970
of ground each time yeah so basically

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,950
what you end up doing is you flatten the

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,379
erase so you would take these images and

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,499
you would flatten them out so if you

00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:04,149
think about in terms of like columns you

00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:07,509
have would have twelve columns one for

00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:11,590
each month and then your pixels are in

00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:17,889
our index to the index each pixel has an

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:19,499
equivalent okay are there any further

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,340
questions

00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:22,899
otherwise think it's time for afternoon

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,360
tea can we please he would be right up

00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:32,590
close the bar and again
