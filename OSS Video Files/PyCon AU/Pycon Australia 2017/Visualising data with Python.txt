	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
and we'll get some awesome live demos

00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm sorry for the delay guys we're just

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,760
attaching an adapter to my laptop

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:18,770
because it's a MacBook Air and it

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:23,449
doesn't have a lot of ports yeah great

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:30,390
excellent nope

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:32,369
so I'm by audible okay great all right

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,710
so I'm going to talk about visualizing

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,750
data in Python and this is going to be a

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,120
fairly pragmatic talk about Python

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,950
libraries because if you're like me you

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,600
probably have a tool set that you use to

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,750
do everything and you hear about all

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,760
these other options and you don't know

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,410
whether you should take the time to go

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,760
and check them out and maybe change what

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,989
you're doing

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,960
and for those who don't know Jake van

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,949
der puss gave a very similarly themed

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,640
talk Python in the u.s. earlier this

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,729
year in May so I'm going to do my best

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,720
not to duplicate his talk so this won't

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,250
be such a high-level survey of libraries

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,409
if you want that I highly recommend you

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,200
watch his talk it's online and the pike

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,040
on YouTube channel but he came up with

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,630
this diagram which as you can see is

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,479
bewildering right there's all these

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,490
libraries so if you hear about new

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,770
things coming out and they sound there's

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,270
a lot of buzz people are excited but

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,640
should I try it it's really hard to know

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,960
and the fact that there's so many is

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,009
kind of demotivating it would actually

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,810
be useful for me to be able to see the

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:55,200
time all right now this is going to be a

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,729
very time challenged talk because I'm

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,710
gonna try to do a demo because I think

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,560
one of the nice things about talking

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,290
about interactive libraries is getting

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,729
to see them working so I apologize I'm

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,719
going to try to squash some things in

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,250
and at same time I'm gonna have to leave

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,899
a lot out I obviously cannot possibly

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,500
talk about all the things in this

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,520
diagram so I'm going to pick a few

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,410
wave my hands and talk a bit about the

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,910
rest so one of the nice things about

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,320
this diagram is that I don't know if

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,120
it's very easy to see but there are some

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,510
hubs that things are organized around

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,460
they've in bold so those are them

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,580
maybe the change makes it easier to spot

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,010
them and the idea here is that some of

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,820
these libraries are built on others so

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,920
there's a whole lot of visualization

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,480
libraries that build on that plot live

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
and use it under the hood and then

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,830
there's other and they get the strengths

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,110
of matplotlib which is that can render

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,520
to a lot of image formats it's got a lot

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,470
of low-level control you can tweak

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,290
everything there's other libraries that

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,180
ship with a JavaScript library or maybe

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,440
use some pre-existing JavaScript library

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,650
and they use that for their rendering

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,090
back-end so the Python library specifies

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,709
a plot panzon over to the JavaScript

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,970
library which renders it and they get

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:09,209
the strengths of JavaScript which is of

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:10,980
cause interactivity there's a couple

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,440
there that are built on OpenGL the

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,330
strength of that is rendering using a

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,600
GPU rendering a large number of points

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:22,110
very quickly so I should also just point

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,590
out on this plot things I've just turned

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,900
pink not Python libraries most of these

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,440
circles are Python libraries but

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,670
javascript is obviously a language d3.js

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,880
is a JavaScript library and Vega is a

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,519
JSON schema for declaratively specifying

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,140
lots and bakelite is another version of

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,850
those same things so they're there as

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,780
hubs because there are things built on

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,780
d3.js

00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,480
okay so I'm going to talk a little bit

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,180
about some libraries and I'm gonna flip

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
over to the notebook and do a demo I'm

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,310
not gonna tell you what Jupiter is

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,959
because probably everyone in this room

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,920
knows and if you don't you'll see it I'm

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,140
not going to tell you what pandas is

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,329
because did oh I will just say though

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,530
that Jupiter is probably a driver of

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,209
some of the interactivity we're seeing

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,519
in libraries these days because so many

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,380
of us now to our our data exploration in

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,989
the browser okay so here's the data set

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,639
I'm going to use as a demo this is the

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,699
national electronic injury surveillance

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,810
system it's got some fields that are not

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,680
listed here but here the fields I'm

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,229
going to actually use so this is a

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,620
panda's data frame or a spreadsheet if

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,900
you like every row is an incident and

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,240
injury incident and people these

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,460
incidents get reported what product was

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,500
involved in the injury it was planned at

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,720
the point of the database so you can see

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,970
we've got the age of the patient they're

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,010
their sex the date it happened on

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,700
product so this is the floor there's

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,520
basketball

00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,180
there's ceilings and walls where it

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,530
happened what body part was injured and

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,240
the nice thing about this one this is

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,820
what kind of way I chose it is that for

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,620
most of the incidents we have a little

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,150
narrative and that's nice for

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,960
demonstrating some visualization

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,700
features so a 17 year old complains of

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,879
hand pain after punching a wall in anger

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,949
right

00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,969
you can't you can't plot that stuff but

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,099
if you have interactive visualization

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:29,289
you can explore it so just really

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,659
quickly matplotlib I'm sure everyone

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,639
knows of matplotlib it is the oldest of

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:35,919
the plotting libraries in Python really

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,360
it's been going a long time it's still

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,629
going strong but usually now it's

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,509
underpinning something else it's

00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,520
original API was invented to mimic

00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,729
MATLAB because it helped people to

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,009
switch over which is probably not the

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:53,620
interface we would want now it does have

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,750
an object-oriented API sometimes it's

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,969
hard time in the documentation how to do

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,560
things one way versus the other way it's

00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,599
very powerful you can kind of do almost

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,750
anything you want in black blue but

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:08,560
sometimes it takes some effort and it's

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,240
probably worth mentioning that

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,159
matplotlib 2.0 came out this year and

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,310
matplotlib is now a lot prettier by

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,479
default so it's updated the fonts the

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,520
color schemes it's colorblind friendly

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,139
it doesn't have black lines around

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,150
shapes by default all that sort of stuff

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:30,009
I won't spend time on that so the first

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,259
thing I'm going to show you is Seaborn

00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:33,279
and then I'll show you a couple of

00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,240
interactive things actually I'll tell

00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,759
you now what I'm going to show you I

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,830
want to show you see bond okay and

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,060
holidays and I picked those because I

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,969
found them interesting and they feel

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,589
very different niches I apologize if I'm

00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,080
not going to get to your favorite tool

00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,400
or your tool and if I have time I hope

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,169
I'll talk about some of the others but

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,180
not actually demo them there's

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,360
definitely others that are interesting

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,810
on here so because they're all of uses

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,879
there so the niche that see bond fills

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,229
is it's been around for a while it

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,639
builds on matplotlib but gives you all

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,110
the control that matplotlib gives you

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,759
because you can always fall back to

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,279
matplotlib and manipulate those objects

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,389
directly it is static unless you use

00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,039
something else to add interactive

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,839
activity onto it it just gives you study

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,219
plots it's very pretty

00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,219
so you kind of get publication quality

00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:20,620
graphs out of the box with not a huge

00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:24,729
amount of effort so let's switch over to

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,789
a notebook already and start looking at

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:29,560
some data now is that legible or do I

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,069
need to make fonts bigger I think that's

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,069
probably okay

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,419
so this is our data frame it's got a few

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,669
fields I've added this incident count

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,800
field here which is just one everywhere

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,030
every incident has a count of one it

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,370
means that when I want to do summary

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,530
statistics the names of my fields will

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,840
make a bit more sense so to start off

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,289
let's ask a question like what products

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,880
injure people most often just make a bar

00:07:54,289 --> 00:08:01,220
plot in matplotlib and you can see that

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,699
people are most often injured by stairs

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,960
I should say I've there are lots of

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,509
products in the dust database I've

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,590
restricted us to the top 12 just so I

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,460
don't have to fool around with that

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:16,039
while I'm doing demos they are second

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,470
the second culprit is the floor third

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,940
culprit is basketball which I find

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,449
really impressive there must be a lot of

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:29,180
basketball going on the US and then beds

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:30,590
and their knives and this is a straight

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,639
matplotlib plot you can see it's a lot

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,740
prettier than it would have been in

00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,770
saved last year matplotlib now has

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,870
context managers so if I switch to the

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:44,480
classic style and remake this plot

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,770
you'll see this is this is probably

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,910
older than last year but this is what

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,350
that probably looked like once upon a

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:53,570
time right it's pretty clunky so looking

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,579
at Seabourn in that pot live I kind of I

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,149
had to add up all the numbers myself to

00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,220
get a bar plot

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,160
it doesn't do that for me and then I

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,980
have to specify where the edges of the

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,810
boxes should be I had to say the bottom

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,790
of each line should be here and the

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,670
length of each line should be the sum of

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,920
my counts and so on in Seabourn it knows

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,040
about pandas so I just say my daughter

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,560
is this data frame my y-value is I'll

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,680
pick the location my x-value is the

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,470
incident count and please add them up

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:28,940
right and I get this plot of where do

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,440
incidents occur and as they're always

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,520
telling you most accidents happen in the

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:40,329
home looks like so home is the number

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,329
one place sports places a second

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:51,510
all right if I wanted I could go back to

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,400
our products and see that I could put a

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,350
humor a meter on so I could say give me

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,350
different colors for males and females

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,640
and it doesn't that mostly you can see

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,980
that men get more injuries from

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,490
basketball women get more injuries from

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,390
stairs

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,160
my personal theory is high heels which

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,820
evolved but maybe we could look at

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,610
narratives and find out so it's fairly

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,560
easy to make for instance something like

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,900
this let's say what parts of the body

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,220
two people injure with different

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:33,990
products using a heatmap knives usually

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:38,370
injure fingers the floor usually injures

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:41,370
the head the ceiling of the wall

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,280
probably the wall right usually inches

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,100
either the head or the hand and the

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,840
basketball usually inches your ankle has

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,670
two stairs so it's a heatmap

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,430
and a few things you can see here is

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,730
that I didn't do much and it's very

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,260
pretty

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,910
save on is automatically detected that

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,420
my numbers are positive so it's used a

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,160
continuous color scale from light to

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,230
dark rather than a diverging color scale

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,510
with two colors because I don't have

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,310
positive and negative data and it's

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,800
rotated the axis labels for me

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,690
everything's legible it's nice like I

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,390
could I could put this in a paper right

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,320
there's only a couple of lines I'm just

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,030
going to skim through stuff because I

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,060
don't have enough time to spend on c1 by

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,260
itself we could ask how old are the

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,490
people who get injured by different

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,740
products young people injure themselves

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,220
with basketballs and footballs older

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,490
people injure themselves with chairs and

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:35,010
floor and finally last one I'll do a

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,590
save on this is a joint plot it's just

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,810
an example of putting together a fairly

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,050
sophisticated visualization very little

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,750
code it puts a histogram on each axis

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,780
and some kind of scatter plot or density

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,840
plot in the middle so here I've done the

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,150
day of the month so this is one month in

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,770
December and I've said what day of the

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,380
month did the injury occur

00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,700
and how old was the person just because

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,320
those are continuous variables that I

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,910
had available to me you don't really

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,590
expect that age will vary with day of

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,540
the month but in fact because this is

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,790
December we can see that something

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,650
happens over Christmas which is that

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,720
young people stop injuring themselves so

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:23,180
much over Christmas which probably is

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,180
because they stop playing basketball I

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,480
could have made this scatter plots but

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,800
it would be awful because it's the

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,900
classic problem of over plotting right

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,660
it's there's too many points in the data

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,820
set so some kind of density plot makes

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,080
sense hex is nice there's also a kernel

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,440
density estimation that will give you

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,920
contours ok let's go back well so you

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,870
won't get to anything else so

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,050
Seabourn is really pretty but it's

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,600
totally static bokeh is an example of a

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,250
library that has interactivity built in

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,130
every plot you make is interactive at

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,380
least a little bit chips it's really a

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,820
framework it's all-encompassing it ships

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,970
with its own JavaScript library has its

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,890
own widgets and things it actually gives

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,300
you quite good low-level control even

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,650
though it's not built on that lip

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,050
they've implemented my level control

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:18,630
pretty well I'd say one a weakness if at

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,280
the time that the plaque on us talk was

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:26,070
given was that it couldn't export to SVG

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:28,230
even now it can and I'd say compared to

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,750
I think a competitor is plotly it's

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:35,370
probably in the same space possibly be Q

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:38,100
plot Altair is up and coming one

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,930
weakness of boku perhaps is that the BK

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,260
charts package has less built in plot

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:45,510
types that it will just do for you than

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,070
some of the competitors like what Li but

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,450
of course that changes and one strength

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,820
of Berk is that other libraries are

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,470
built on it all of uses of an example so

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,750
that kind of gives you the higher-level

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,980
libraries so let's just quickly do a

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,980
couple of examples of that

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,350
so in this is the basic way that you

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,370
make a plot in Bocca I've said now this

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,510
is the bit where I start to get nervous

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,399
about Internet connectivity and

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,700
everything as I do JavaScript demos in a

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,100
notebook I've said draw me some circles

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,959
make the x-axis of the day and the

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,300
y-axis the age so it's conceptually the

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,459
same as this I've just taken a random

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,250
subset of my data so that it will work

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,709
so that I don't have too many points and

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,510
I can demo it so we get just a scatter

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:33,339
plot but because it is a JavaScript

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:38,889
based library there's automatically a

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:41,050
pen tool and a zoom tool even if I don't

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,959
ask for any other forms of interactivity

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,149
and it's pretty painless to switch on

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,380
some other forms of interactivity here

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:53,079
I've switched on a couple of different

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:55,899
things one is I've done male and female

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,310
as two different elements of the legend

00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,360
and I've turned on the legend click

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,420
policy hide

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,709
so if I click male all the male points

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,350
disappear the other feature I've turned

00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:11,160
on is a father tool and I've said please

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:13,660
give me the narrative in my hospital

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,480
which means hopefully if I hover over a

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:22,499
point I can see the narratives right so

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,179
we can choose whatever we want this is

00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:32,309
an astonishing number of hand injuries

00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:36,209
on the ones I didn't see that one I'm

00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:38,459
gonna take your word for it um we are

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,499
short on time so I may skip over this

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,819
there's a be ketchup package charts

00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:44,339
package which lets you do higher level

00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:48,149
stuff like heat maps and bar plots and

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,669
box plots and so on and one one thing

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:54,209
that is worth demoing is that it's

00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:56,369
really easy in Burke here to link up to

00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,379
plots so here when I made my second I've

00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,730
got two plots if you wanted me to when I

00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,319
make my second one I'm saying the X

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,569
range should be the X range of the first

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,999
one and the wiring should be the wide

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:07,499
range of the first time one so I've done

00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:11,819
one for basketball and one for stairs

00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:13,739
and the consequence is that if I pan one

00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,299
of them the other one should pend -

00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,459
because I specified that the X axes

00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,209
should be the same and i zoom one of

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,290
them the other one should zoom - right

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,989
there's also I haven't got at them all

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,669
of it but it's very easy to link up plot

00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:29,220
so that if you select points in one the

00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,389
corresponding points get selected in the

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,609
other all those things are really easy

00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,989
it also ships with widgets and things to

00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:35,639
do really sophisticated things with

00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:36,809
widgets you need to not be using just a

00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,749
notebook you need to run a bouquets

00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:42,359
server or you need to write custom

00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:45,089
JavaScript callbacks all right so I've

00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:46,109
got some slides on portly and bq+ and

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,730
I'm actually not going to talk about

00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:49,889
them unless we have time at the end you

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,069
can ask me questions later because we're

00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,019
so rushed then but I do want to show you

00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,089
and demo Holub use because it's kind of

00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,980
feeling in each step so far as I know

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,379
nothing else is really filling filling I

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,879
found it very interesting their slogan

00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,470
is stop putting your data and I take

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,959
your data and let it visualize itself

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,880
which I found mr. playing but what it

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,309
really means to me is that once you've

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,679
set your data set up the code to produce

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:19,949
a quite complex visualization is very

00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,350
concise so the idea behind all of you is

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,970
the reason it exists as I understand is

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:28,470
that if you're exploring your data you

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,120
don't want to write 20 lines of code to

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,210
get a nice visualization because it's a

00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,700
distraction

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,720
if you're producing a plot for an

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,830
audience it doesn't matter

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,790
but if you're just gonna cure and

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,950
exploring your data and trying to

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,780
understand what's going on pausing and

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,220
writing 20 lines of code just to make a

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,990
plot it gets in the way

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,400
holla B's uses other libraries to do

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,040
with actual rendering so it can render

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,090
to matplotlib it can render to okay if

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,150
you're in its map whatever you get the

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,650
advantages matplotlib like although

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,570
they're pretty controls if you read it

00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,980
to boku you get interactivity I believe

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,940
there's an experimental renderer to

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:06,100
Watley its main drawback if you feel it

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,450
as a drawback is that it's quite a

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,270
learning curve because it is different

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,130
it's different conceptually and

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:16,390
syntactically so of all the libraries I

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:19,390
learnt in researching this talk this one

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,550
took me the longest but I'm glad I did

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,140
so I guess that's the trade-off right

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,550
it's whether you're trying to find

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,050
something that you can just get into

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,580
really quickly or whether you want to do

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,410
something that's powerful but you need

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,130
to maybe put in some time to get your

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,200
head around it

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,280
so I'll just show you a couple of things

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,590
that it can do so I hope this is legible

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,400
I can make it bigger if it's not at the

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,660
back of it no one's complaining ok so

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,930
the first thing I have to do is I've got

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:51,460
my tabular data I'm actually gonna sub

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,530
sample it slightly but ok most of the

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,360
points I need to make a whole of use

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:59,350
data set and I need to i've got k diems

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,150
acadians are the things i want to look

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,940
up my data by I might want to slice it

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,180
on them or facet into different plots

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,290
based on these variables or color the

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,470
points differently based on these

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,970
variables so I've put in sex what is the

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,040
product of me and what is the body part

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,700
as my variables that I want to gather

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,230
lookup Vadim's the variables I might

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,170
want to plot as functions of these other

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:25,210
things that's the rough idea and so I

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:29,190
put in age and day an incident count and

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:32,170
narrative once you've made your data set

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,490
it's got you can kind of look at what's

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,870
inside it right it's got all these

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,420
things you can see the data that

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,140
originally made it and well its

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,140
parameters

00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,870
but if you want to render something here

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm making a scatterplot

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,070
so first I've said just for now throw

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,440
away some of the variables because I

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,350
want to make a simple plot first so just

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,760
keep these dimensions and then I'm

00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,180
saying make a scatter plot of day

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,400
against age which is what we did before

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,740
and the first thing you'll see is

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,900
there's a widget here and the reason is

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,060
that one of my dimensions was product

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,160
and I didn't tell hall of use what to do

00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,200
with that dimension and I didn't use it

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,940
in my plot so hollow views automatically

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,550
turns it into a widget that I can select

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,960
from so every Kadem is here to look up

00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,600
your data in some form or other either

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,960
it's inside the plot or it's a widget to

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,980
go over your plots so here I could

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,500
switch between basketballs and doors

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,840
this was they against age right so we

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,980
saw that basketball injuries fall off

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,750
over Christmas I noticed when I was

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,640
exploring this that knife injuries

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:55,680
seemed to spike over Christmas I assume

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:57,060
people are preparing food stairs and

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,760
steps so you can see there's a kind of a

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,110
different age distribution for these

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,330
things and in some cases a different

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,030
date distribution so I'm going to repeat

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,590
this but this time I'll keep all my

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,750
variables I won't throw some away I

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:14,520
won't simplify it so much and here I've

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,770
used overlay six so overlay means I want

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,630
to see male and female on the same plot

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,720
and basically they'll just be different

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,720
colors

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,020
I'm slightly nervous every time I hit

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,210
execute because if we have a Wi-Fi issue

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,520
or something it's all it's all

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:37,650
JavaScript based it's thinking all right

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,210
okay so I didn't throw away any

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,790
variables so we've got both product and

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,290
body part are left over and so they've

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,300
both been turned into drop-down widgets

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,860
if they were numerical variables they'd

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,630
be sliders but because they're

00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,410
categorical variables they're drop-down

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,900
lists so now we could ask for instance

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:59,910
oh and sorry I should point out I also

00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,580
said in the specification of how to how

00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,590
to present this plot I said turn on the

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,720
bouquet hover tool so I said render

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:11,340
using the bouquet backend and provide me

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,940
with a hospital so now I can say how are

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:23,550
all these people using the wall to

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:26,210
injure their hand they are this one is

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:30,930
punching the walls

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:36,330
this one is punching the wall punching a

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:37,680
wall so and it's fairly young people who

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,810
seem to punch the wall or at least you

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:44,850
know not younger than middle-aged people

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:46,680
both genders but you can see it's nice

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,150
right I there were very few lines of

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,480
code involved in this there's basically

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:54,960
one line of code and I can ask questions

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,210
like when people are injuring their hand

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,510
with the wall what are the narratives

00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,860
and I can explore it interactively so

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,150
I'll show you one more feature if I love

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,550
yous and then I'll stop there are more

00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,870
features what I've done here if you look

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,110
at when I actually put it I've said bars

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:12,150
plus scatter that means I've made up an

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,590
elements called bars an element called

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,870
scatter just put them next to each other

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:20,030
and the reason I'm making this bar plot

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,030
is I want to say well when I'm up here

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:28,140
when I look at say how are people

00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:30,870
injuring their eyeball with the wall

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,490
there's not many points right so I would

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,220
like to know for that for the products

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,180
I'm looking at what what parts of the

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,960
body are people enjoying with that

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,640
product which

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,440
dropdownlist so interesting which ones

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,330
should I bother to select so I've made a

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,800
bar plot to say aggregate over all the

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,590
other variables and just show me how

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,970
many people get injured on each body

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,710
part for the product I happen to be

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,010
looking at now and I won't go through

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,560
the syntax and when I say plus you can

00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,850
see it just puts them next to each other

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,840
it still gives me the variables that I

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,490
haven't used in this case the body part

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,140
actually is used in this graph but it's

00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,520
not used in this one so when I change

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,990
the body part the left hand graph won't

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,480
change but the right-hand one will right

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,840
so on the left hand one here I can see

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,660
that for basketball it's usually ankles

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,310
fingers they're a bit of head and knee

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,780
right that's getting injured and so I

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,940
could choose that and then I could mouse

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,020
over to say how are people injuring

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:34,830
their ankles when playing basketball

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:38,810
um we're nearly at time so I'm gonna

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,810
stop showing you things um

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,050
there's other nice features of our views

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,090
I guess the the take-home thing is the

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,580
syntax is different to stuff you may be

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,810
used to but it is very concise like I

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,150
said I might data set and I can do all

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,070
these things really well so in fact in

00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,570
tennessee's talk what would be good in a

00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,190
data hackathon this would be excellent

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,810
so long as you already know it well you

00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,280
were already learning this in a data

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,300
hackathon but it would be great for

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:14,490
exploring your data all right so let's

00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:16,620
go back so we've got five minutes I'll

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,810
use those five minutes firstly to say

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,640
this I think that this may be what

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,170
people really want and it's a scary

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,860
slide to write because it's very

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,980
personal

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,570
right and everyone's opinions differ so

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,240
these are just my suggested starting

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,220
points if you want to produce static

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,190
publication quality graphs I would

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,440
recommend see bond if you want to get

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,000
started with interactive plots and you

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,500
don't want a huge learning curve then I

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,210
think bouquet and plotly are both really

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,210
nice they have slightly different

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,860
strengths and weaknesses all Altair is

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,390
fairly young and it's documentation is

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,770
fairly young but I think it's going to

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,770
be really interesting I didn't talk

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,270
about it much first

00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,860
because it's young and secondly because

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,120
Jake vendor prices involved in that

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,620
project and he talked about it fairly

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,390
extensively in May so you can go and

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:06,310
watch his talk and hear all about it

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:07,570
um I think what Lee has the feature

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,450
which may be positive or negative in

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,640
that has this business model which may

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,910
be a good thing depending on what what

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,010
area you're working in whole of users

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,320
invoker is really good for interactive

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,960
data exploration I didn't talk about it

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,330
but there's been a lot of talk about

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,850
data shader recently as a way of

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,890
handling really large volumes of data

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,870
when you've got like millions or maybe

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,850
billions of points you can't just plot

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,740
those on a graph because of performance

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,210
and also because of over plotting right

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,920
once your plot points get to a certain

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,840
density you can't see how many there are

00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,230
anymore so you need something that works

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,030
out an appropriate binning or density

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,840
rendering of your plot and sends the

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:51,370
pixels to the browser not the points and

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,020
data shade is one of the things that

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:57,160
does that another is I don't know how to

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,210
pronounce it ax and I've got to say that

00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,950
as we get towards the bottom of the

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,420
graph these are less things that I have

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,460
personal experience in and more things

00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,190
that I hear people talking about I don't

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,170
really work with geographical data

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,180
myself but people have talked to me

00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,500
about I buy leaflets so actually after

00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,970
this in the questions if people have

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,370
particular recommendations especially

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,370
for those bottom couple of things maybe

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,170
you could share them and this very last

00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,570
thing this is really interesting and I

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,710
just didn't have time to fit it in

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,250
there's a few things that let you build

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:30,370
your own dashboard or your own web app

00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:32,890
that explores data where the front end

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,840
talks to the back end and it's pretty

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:38,050
much a fully featured app but it's very

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,360
easy to write plotly - is one that came

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,620
out not too long ago and people really

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,390
like it

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,740
boki server fills a similar niche bq+

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,610
I wish I had had more time to talk about

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,430
if you what it's works closely with IP

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,500
widgets which are the Jupiter notebooks

00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,910
preferred way of doing widgets so you

00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,550
know sliders and drop-down lists and

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,400
things putting a bigger pot pot together

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,630
with widgets and wiring them up is a

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,730
nice way to get a dashboard as

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:08,860
and it's probably the most notebook

00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,950
native way to do it right it's not a

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:19,960
standalone web app it's in the notebook

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:22,060
so I guess how long have I got

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,740
I've managed to rush through things

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,250
slightly faster than I thought so I'm

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,940
going to go back this is when I didn't

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,200
get to talk about what we it's been neck

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,540
and neck with Boca I would say in some

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,450
sense in that some people like it more

00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,490
and some people like it less it has a

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,890
declarative JSON schema not Vega or Vega

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,480
lights but its own schema and like like

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,910
pretty much anything that has a

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,830
JavaScript library at some point the

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,840
Python library has to specify the plot

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,540
as an object and hand it over to the

00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,010
JavaScript library and in the best cases

00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,760
that Sun in a transparent way so that

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:04,090
you can see the specification and modify

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:08,530
it and it's a declarative object and it

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,390
does do that it was originally something

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,340
very much based around online use but

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,080
they've now kind of fully open sourced

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,700
the JavaScript library you can use

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,320
everything offline I think there may

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,570
still be some restrictions on unpaid

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,920
accounts possibly exporting to certain

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,060
file formats and it's cross-platform so

00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,280
it's quite nice if you're getting

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,310
started quickly and it has the chart

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,630
types you want it probably doesn't give

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,210
you as much low-level controllers but

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,410
okay that's my my feeling be keep what I

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,520
was just talking about it's very

00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:39,520
interesting it's much more lightweight

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,560
than say bouquet it's and it's probably

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,850
not intended for huge quantities of data

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:47,080
all right I have to stop but it's not

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,820
intended to do everything it's intended

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,120
to work with I fly widgets and other

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,690
libraries to accomplish what it

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,250
accomplishes okay so I think my friend

00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,550
out of time so I'm gonna say what have

00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,550
we learned

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:10,140
yeah

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,140
