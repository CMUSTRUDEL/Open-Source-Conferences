did you sing jean-sebastien Bevilaqua

00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:16,680
close I'm sorry um who has joined us

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:19,199
from a long way away he's - guy French

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,020
guy and has done quite a bit hacking in

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:35,070
the 3d space please join me in working

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:35,640
in him Hey ok it's working ok so ok do

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,899
you hear me

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,480
yes ok so welcome everyone I'm glad to

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,489
be here with you today so if I give this

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,370
talk it's because I truly believe in

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,399
sci-fi to improve maintainability and

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,199
war business of Python extension I want

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,329
to share with you my experience in order

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,340
to convince you to give a try to see if

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,829
a file next time you need to write a

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,860
Python extension ok so like you can hear

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,610
from my accent I'm French and I come

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,900
from Paris after one full day in plane

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,409
this is not the right time you can add a

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,960
trio so it's very long yet it allows me

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,720
to discover your magnificent country and

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,159
you Australian people so by the way you

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,710
are very welcoming thank you

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,950
Who am I so I'm John Sebastian Bevilaqua

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,790
I write free software every day and I'm

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,009
a fan of open source ecosystem and

00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:38,369
philosophy so you can find the big part

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,790
of my contribution on github moreover I

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,009
work at in Agora it's a French company

00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,320
that promotes free software and it's

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,140
this company which encouraged me to give

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,570
this talk so if you need support for

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,920
free software just contacts list we'll

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,469
be happy to do it so first why do we

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,590
need python extension I'm going to tell

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,640
you my use case so approximately one

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,950
year ago the new VidCon API was released

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,649
VidCon is a new graphic API that will

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,930
replace OpenGL in the near future I

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,489
don't know if you do you know of it come

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:20,220
yes No someone okay so it's a very

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,040
low-level graphic API you can create

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,720
Triple A games with it and it's course

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,920
compatible with Windows Linux and

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,519
Android nowadays the server steam games

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,409
use good calm so when you go back at

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,230
this time I was enjoying OpenGL

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,209
development and with Wilco I saw an

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,900
opportunity to improve my 3d and

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,359
low-level knowledge and of course Beaton

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,459
was my languages of choice we all know

00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:52,430
why but there was no binding between

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:55,379
Python and will come so you should use a

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,799
language like C to use will come no

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:02,250
Python but as you may know if it comes a

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,409
low-level API and in order to use it you

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,170
have to call low-level function like GL

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,750
open and jail time so I decided to write

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,639
my book on biting fro baton directly in

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,470
C with the sea patency API at first as a

00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,269
sign that you should know that patent

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:24,000
extension can be used to improve

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:26,099
performance but it was not - case so

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,750
sadly with C language you can have

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,310
system errors like segmentation faults a

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,129
marvelous Python it can be very apt to

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,980
track a segmentation fault also you use

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,409
variant can help you but you still a

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:45,299
it's still a difficult task that you

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,549
won't enjoy I promise so to write a bite

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,060
an extension in C you have to make use

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,609
of the sea Payton API it allows you to

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,139
create module at function and classes in

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,389
it

00:03:54,139 --> 00:04:00,269
after reading the good C Python API I

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,459
starts in my C extension so it was clear

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,519
and I'd felt self-confident but it's

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,340
still C so we have to fight again malloc

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,639
and free like usual but because it's too

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,459
easy

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,120
see bite an API at the reference

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,310
counting and the camera API I almost

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,430
give up several times due to the amount

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,830
of rock we are going to see existing

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,450
solution to result to live with our

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,450
complexity of C extension

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:33,370
but before that let's see API in API

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:36,520
mode because from now I will often use

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,760
ABI API words so I need to explain

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,100
clearly what I mean by this terms API

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,180
means application programming interface

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:49,090
and API application binary interface so

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,180
the API mud it was it what humans use

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,160
you call a function you need to know the

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,690
name of the function and the argument to

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,840
pass so as a programming interface it's

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,300
all expressed in South Scott the API is

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,750
very similar think of it as a compiled

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,170
version of the API to be clear when you

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,350
write the program you use the human API

00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,790
then when your program is compiled

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,000
computer will access the API of the

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:22,030
library maybe you wonder the goal of API

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,270
mode from a human point of view we could

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,340
just stick with the API accessing a

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,500
library with API mode allows you to

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,120
dynamically link at runtime and tools

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,960
can be used with an interpreted language

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,230
like Python without compilation also a

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,660
mod can be interesting to use you have

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,680
to explicitly described the binary

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,430
interfund like you will see after we see

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,230
types so let's see the existing solution

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,620
to easily easily write to bite an

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,200
extension so like I said just before you

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,390
can do it with the C Python API but it's

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,600
a difficult task

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:03,880
the first one is Satan Satan use an

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,280
interesting approach it can execute

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,290
directly or by Duncan and you can add

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,060
new syntax these elements by iteration

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,030
it's very good but when you start to add

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,490
custom site and some tags like here your

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,010
Python code is normal Python and so you

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,670
lose possibility and Satan becomes a

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,980
required

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,710
dependency you should take that into

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,910
account before using it such a

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,740
dependency can be dangerous sometime

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,750
moreover the first goal of Satan is to

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,910
improve personal performance of pattern

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,910
not to write rubber

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:48,030
Satan can be compiled into supports API

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,160
and hmm that's a good point

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,790
another solution that everyone knows is

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,490
c-types the only advantages of c-types

00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,560
it's because it's a built-in so it's a

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,410
good point because you can be sure

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,390
c-types is always available with c-types

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,210
you don't need computation it works on

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,970
the a bi mát only so you didn't have a

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:15,010
clean link at run time during the to the

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,480
library so here an example of C types

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,540
like if you like you can see on the

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,230
screen to use C types you need to learn

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,660
a new API to see types API you have to

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,940
translate your C either to the C types

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:33,640
API in this example I declare I forgot a

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,650
yeah the same thing same screen here but

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,680
that look here so in this example I

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,680
declare open strict and get back the

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,780
victor size function from the library

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,660
it's error-prone and cumbersome if you

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,200
were very big library like VidCon it

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,460
will be painful and it could lead to

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:58,900
segmentation fault because you can have

00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:01,390
a be a mismatch no the light 7 years ago

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,610
to smart people I mean we go and match

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,520
each pin Charles key created save a file

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,040
maybe you know this name because I

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,770
thought pi PI 2 so it's not a piece of

00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,669
cake for information pi PI is an

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,220
alternative interpreter with a JIT edge

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,410
it is a just-in-time compiler so at

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,500
first cff I was an alternative to see

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,979
types it was working only and the API

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,940
mode later the API mode was added and

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,840
revolutionist

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,820
pattern ecosystem extension ecosystem

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,300
before us if if I to create an API mode

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,960
extension for pattern API you had to use

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:44,140
the C Python C API or Satan which only

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,990
work with see Peyton now with CF fi

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,050
extensions are working with C pattern 2

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,860
3 and PI pi without changing 1/9 of

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,959
chocolate

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,800
no you understand a billion api mod I

00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,019
can show you how it works with the FFA

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,589
but let's introduce another concept of

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:07,160
CF fi this one is a lot simpler than a

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:09,890
billion a pyramid so first in the inline

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,170
mode when you use the inline mode every

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,610
single set up every time you import your

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:18,260
Python cutter in the out of line mud you

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,170
have a separate step of preparation and

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,839
possibly compilation that produces a

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,779
module which your main program can then

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,990
import of course inline mode is

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:35,390
available only for IBM word since API

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:39,470
mud always requires competition okay so

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:42,680
this first example show how to work with

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,320
a billion in line mud it's a very

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,050
classic example this is the first

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,720
pictures reported by CF Fi and it's

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,120
exactly what C types is done for so you

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,279
can compare it with C types like you can

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,190
see we say if fi you just pass the C

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,329
either to see dev and open your library

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:06,829
with GL open that's all yeah I let CF a

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:09,440
fine no ze open function by passing the

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:13,130
printf function by passing it to the CDF

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,199
function next I create a char argument

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,430
and I can pass it to the printer

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:23,750
function so it just magic CF fi syntax

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,550
is clean and intuitive if you run this

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,899
example on your computer you will get

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:33,019
this result it works very well I print

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,490
with the printf function not the Python

00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:38,240
print function it's make a big

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,760
difference you have your you can use all

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,300
the entire scene in space with this demo

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,670
I usually this did I usually do this

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,709
demo in life but last time it was at

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:54,800
over by 10 and my terminal died during

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:57,320
the talk so I don't take the risk but

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,290
chef fi goes one step further with its

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,740
API mode this time we are going to use a

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,509
pyramid with the PWD library so

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,360
still similar but you can notice a

00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:13,259
difference we pass the code to see FF I

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,949
with sets or function in the sauce we

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:19,410
just include PWD and types in the CDF we

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,290
don't need to add all PWD functions just

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,660
the one we want to use so here we use

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,290
only two functions and we don't need all

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,149
fields of path summary district finally

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,180
you just ask you see FF I to compare

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:38,610
your mother your module okay it's pretty

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,750
clear when you run the script it

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,209
compares your module

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,079
it's just a Python script and see if Fi

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:47,149
and there's the compilation pad for us

00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,589
compilation is fully cross-platform

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:54,199
thanks to CSV file so it works on

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:57,300
Windows Linux Mike I think we didn't try

00:11:54,199 --> 00:12:00,000
like you can see see FF I do the

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,860
compilation in three steps first it

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,379
generates a sip file containing the

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,100
source code and the CFI black magic

00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:10,800
secret it compiles this file into an

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:16,680
object file and finally it generates the

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:21,930
Python module so the Python module is is

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,730
the demo tool that supplied etc with

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,060
this mod your pattern extraction is

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,819
robust fast and easy to maintain with

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,040
this API mud you can't add segmentation

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,069
fault due to a mismatch in epi you can I

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,750
have a segmentation fault if you cut is

00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:41,310
that we're working but it's not due to

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:46,009
the mismatching ABI okay let's try it

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:49,380
now do do like it's a demo it's not bad

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:53,550
fraternities okay on the top you can see

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,610
the content of demo to run file and the

00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:00,319
result and the bottom like you can see

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:04,319
we get root if we ask for the PID 0 and

00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:06,300
we get 1000 if you ask for my place so

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:10,290
like you can see it very easy and

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,649
intuitive to use the Lib is contained or

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,559
the rapidly bridge so it's fully work

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,400
and it's a real compile it's about an

00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,440
extension it's nice

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,240
no they're interesting part so I'm

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,300
currently building a 3d engine with

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,910
baton and the new VidCon graphic API

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,640
like I said to you I created the VidCon

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,460
weapon directly in C but if I'm here

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,100
today it's thanks to I mean Ringo when I

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,430
show him my VidCon repair on iesson it

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,220
tells me you could Wi-Fi of course you

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,710
write it you then explain me advantages

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,570
of CF fi it tooks Nomad to meet the new

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,900
challenge right at VidCon rapper

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:54,330
directly we certified so what I ready to

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,190
lose months of work it's a decision but

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:01,830
I definitely made the right choice I'm

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:05,190
going to show you why so like an

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,890
engineer will have statistics VidCon IPA

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,310
is very huge Android app functions and

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:15,680
read of strict and read of constant buzz

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,680
and 5,000 line of code fuzzy either

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,650
wrapping or this API in plain C is

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,860
madness as you can see with this number

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,370
it's Maya's first silver per more than

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:32,720
60,000 line for the generated C file I'm

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,720
crazy enough to have done it

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,270
whereas with CF Fi it's only simple and

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,720
clean Python code to give you an idea

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,850
both time it took me one month and a

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,450
half for the C version and only two

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,180
weeks with the FFI this time is only on

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,340
my on my spare time so I think it would

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,150
like it would have taken only one which

00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:59,340
at full time now with chef fi very fast

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:02,610
when I go to an open issue on github I

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,140
can fix it in one hour usually because

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,630
it's just Python cut there is no C

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,500
involved and the C version was too

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:14,580
difficult to maintain so I would all

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,490
this up this one repair works in both in

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,770
both case I use a generator Khronos

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,130
group did a very good job with will come

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,840
because Kronos is behind Luca all is

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,040
open source and you can contribute

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,250
easily on github

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,590
it provides an XML file that describes

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,690
the API

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,450
so my generator takes this XML file as

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,180
input and generates the vilkin for power

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,820
by doing a generator I can obtain the

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,320
rapper in 2 minutes when the new version

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:50,850
of the API is realized

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:53,220
so basically here are the steps first I

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,670
load and pass XML definition of the

00:15:53,220 --> 00:16:01,110
Ricoh API because there is an XML file

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:03,120
then I generate the data model next I

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,920
generate the Python module with the

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,170
ginger to template I think you know

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,840
ginger to template engine so in the Thai

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,910
now passing like I said passing is done

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,670
with XML to dig package it's a good way

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,950
to pass an XML file without attach it

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,400
transform your XML file into a year she

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,650
can Python dictionary so now that we

00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,360
have a good data model easy to pass we

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,280
can pass it with the ginger to template

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,740
and that's where as the two modules

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,580
differ between the C version is severe

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,490
vibration so what you see here is the

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,650
folder structure of the C extension for

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,660
the C extension there are too much

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,760
things involved so to keep the code

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,030
mental level I had to split it to split

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,970
it up line of course is a line of code

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,650
is a good indicator yeah but what is

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,880
more important is the complexity of the

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,890
cutter like you can see it's pretty huge

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,020
Norva with C code you have to manage

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:06,090
memory yourself and this is very

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:10,050
error-prone now we see FFI okay I think

00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:12,540
it's clear despite of its despite of its

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,180
looks what you see on screen means a lot

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,730
we see FF i I did not mean I did not

00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,790
mean to think about architecture it was

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,720
obvious all in one file so one more

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:27,600
point for C Fifi you don't have to trust

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,680
me once when I say CFA is better let's

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,620
see it in action and you will understand

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,610
so constant constant it is easier paths

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:42,360
and both case are simple in C we just

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,880
use the C Python API to add constant but

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,590
we have to take care about via type the

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,280
you see for int you have a special macro

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,920
with Chef Fi

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:59,040
it's just bitin it and it's dynamically

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,820
tip I'll the variable only with constant

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,920
you don't go far away

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,800
so next step is to create binding for

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,050
strips but there is no strict concept in

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:11,300
pattern so you can use classes which is

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:14,220
you know we see peyten

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:17,730
see patterns capi you have to under the

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,560
new dell in it and get for each member

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,440
you have to use malloc to allocate

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,870
memory for your objects in dell you must

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,570
free your object in in it you have to

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,180
pass each parameter with c python util

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,660
functions and in get you have to convert

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,000
your sister to a Python object so I can

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,760
assure you it takes me a lot of time to

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,410
figure out how to do it properly cut

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,390
this term that I can't show you an

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,810
example on screen but you can go and

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,440
make a table if you want to see we see

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,660
FF final it's 40 line see FF i unders

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,930
force object allocation and deletion I

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,950
just used plain Python to under all

00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,300
struct unionization in a generic way I

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:03,180
repeat to be sure you understand this

00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:07,230
generic new function works for all

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,020
strips of vertical we see bite an API so

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,150
step I showed you just before must be

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,670
done for each strict and there are

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,560
Android of strict so when you realize

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,880
these benefits you just print out with

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,610
CF fi what I showed you

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,490
until area with Viacom proper is the API

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:29,400
mode so let's try the fast and robust

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,530
API mode no we are going to wrap a

00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,860
syllabary

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:39,170
with the API out of line one this mod is

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,170
robust and fast but you need compilation

00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,880
maybe you know shirazi I don't know

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,430
so we are going to wrap shadow silly

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,830
webs shall see the free software done by

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,680
Google guys but not directly related by

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,080
to Google and gives you the ability to

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,270
compel GLSL language to Spearville

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,030
binary

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,650
listen and spare me from Matt's I used

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,770
to create program for your graphic card

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,590
so you take your GLSL card you converts

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,030
it with jealousy in CRV and you put this

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,310
pair we cut in the graphic up to

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:15,450
executive over so it's very very low

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:19,890
level but this surprise is very known

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,350
among the graphic developer and there is

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:27,380
no pattern there world there is no

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:32,370
pattern repel no there is one so when I

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:36,000
do a CFO fire whopper I usually create a

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:38,400
folder dedicated to cff I named chef Fi

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,550
bill and I work among you to do so to

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,860
keep a clean separation of concerns so

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:49,620
Cheryl seed that edge contains share RC

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,630
functions in a signatures and strict we

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:56,940
just copy past the either provided by

00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:59,660
Google and CFA under it Paris liberal is

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:02,250
used to generate the baton extension

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,010
next we have the patience he folder

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,540
containing our proper and finally we'll

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:13,200
take a look at the setup file with a

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:15,120
specially FFA Future so like you see we

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,430
first read content of the chassis either

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,090
here it is this is the script from

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,920
building the developer so we first read

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,380
content of jealousy there and pass it to

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,260
the CDF function that's all for the

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,180
definition three lines and see if I

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:34,140
knows how to under this liberal

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:36,090
beautiful sometimes you need to work you

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,580
down but this time is the reader is

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,870
clean so you don't need to rework it to

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:45,060
refactor it now with these few lines

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,640
with their CFO fight to compile the

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,430
zones with statically linked library

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,080
shut asleep combined and to name the

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:56,850
extension by shall see and okay so

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,400
Sharon C combined is a static library

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,640
that we have to compile before running

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,010
this ufffff iPads I don't show you

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,710
because it's not directly related to

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,210
certify you can look and Gator if you

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,730
are interested in

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,760
so like you can see there is no secret

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,520
involved with just the FFI to open a

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,590
Python bottle to the share a syllabary

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:25,740
here again it looks like magic but

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:28,920
currently our extension is ready but we

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,380
remain dependent of CF fi for example if

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,560
you want to pass a pointer a pointer to

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,050
a function you have to use the FFA when

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,390
using your wrapper you use your users

00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,180
should not mean to know CF fi it's just

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,740
a dependency so we are going to write to

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,580
write a small pattern cut especially

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,560
project record is located in piracy in

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,060
it and is loaded automatically

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,680
automatically when you import your

00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:58,830
module so first this is just by Tonkin

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,530
the wrapper is a unlit by safeassign now

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:06,230
we take the the repel the lib object and

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:09,600
we use it to to make a proper Python API

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,770
so we first load our extension Bushido C

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,570
which contain a few Phi and Lib modules

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,750
leave contain all functions and strict

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,660
related to our library defined in the

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,140
seeder we need if we fight to to

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,150
interface with the only bird let's

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,300
examine the compiled interest PRV

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,350
function remember the shutters a library

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,240
allows you to complete GLSL prosperity

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,770
so our function defined in our extension

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,330
can be accessed through lib object if

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,300
you take a look at the compiled in line

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,270
we can pass pure bites and types like

00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,650
int of string and CFA converts its for

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:53,220
us

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:55,140
clean it entity like you can see not

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,650
that with Python 3

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:03,270
shrank string must be bytes I just put a

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:06,030
bit before the main so shall see returns

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,310
a pointer to us we have to tell CF fi to

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,720
convert it to a byte byte an object

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:14,520
because in in Python there is no pointer

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,800
you can use but we can use byte

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,720
so we first get back the pointer and the

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,140
length but we can't directly copy the

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,690
data to a byte in pattern because bite

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,550
is immaterial so we have to copy that

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:31,050
into a battery and pass it bites object

00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,910
take a look at the if you fight one man

00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,340
move function it's similar to the mem

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,440
copy see function but directly impacted

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:42,270
so I'm doing memory manipulation

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,430
directly in beta in bonus chef fi

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,790
provides provides the setup tools in the

00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:50,730
extension you just add the entry CFA

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:55,410
five modules and your extension we will

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,780
be built by support setup tools now we

00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,600
can enjoy the wizard let's play a simple

00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,480
game using vidcom wrapper and by shadow

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,490
save wrapper the to verbal whistle so

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,860
this simple game is right and fully with

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:16,770
Python and make use of the new shiny

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:27,570
Vulcano API it's a very simple so just

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:29,550
by turning will come no secret okay but

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:42,180
now you can do triple a game but it's

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:44,310
your turn to work now so I hope that

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,710
like me you enjoyed this talk if one day

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,990
you need to reduce a syllabary or to

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,660
improve performance of your code think

00:25:48,990 --> 00:26:01,020
about see if I thank you price for your

00:25:51,660 --> 00:26:03,060
attention and have a nice day we do have

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:09,630
a few minutes for questions so if you've

00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:13,950
got one put your hand up um if you use

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:16,890
the setup tools extension does somebody

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:25,520
installing your application need to have

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:26,730
a compiler installed yes and right but

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,770
okay

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:44,850
would there be any way to pre compiler

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:48,410
and put it into a what happens if you

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,360
don't delete the Python object that is

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,910
representing the C object is that will

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,180
it automatically be freed when it gets

00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:00,540
garbage collected and if so is there a

00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,490
way to attach AC finalizar to an object

00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,590
so you just say when you go out of scope

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,970
please clean up this resource using this

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:12,030
C function so yes if I uh if there is no

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:18,480
reference to a see object C if if I did

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:20,910
destroy it I have a question how does it

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,040
work with other languages so if you've

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:27,420
got your wanting to wrap something else

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,980
which is a compiled language like an

00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,690
Internet you can find an example with

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,270
with you can you can

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,760
it's just exporting an API yeah you can

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:38,310
export your wrist in there and you can

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:44,610
use it with if FA using a brush stereo

00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:48,690
you have to rewrite a see here to blog

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:53,160
who is the person but it just it's just

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,960
first so maybe maybe you need you need

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,070
to see either because if I don't know

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,530
worse so yes you already see them any

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,620
more questions right please join me in

00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,620
thanking

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,030
