our next speaker is Joel Stanley Joel's

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,350
a Linux hacker and embedded electronics

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,090
enthusiasts by day he works on free and

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,490
open source firmware for IBM's power

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,170
servers and by night he hacks on FPGAs

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,230
microcontrollers weather balloons and

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,760
anything he can find a UART on so we're

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,180
talking on micro Python energy

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,849
monitoring thank you thanks for coming

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,560
everyone so today we're gonna have a bit

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,840
of a chat about the use of electrical

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,279
energy in homes in Australia and it's a

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,190
bit of an intersection of my interests

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,690
as a homeowner bill payer hobbyist

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,850
electronics nerd and an embedded

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,219
software engineer so gonna chat a bit

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,260
about the power grid in Australia energy

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,789
costs and do-it-yourself energy

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,469
monitoring including some of the

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,190
challenges in using the hard but it's

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,309
out there to do that

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,850
I'll wicked my laptop's just gonna sleep

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,949
that's a good start

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,840
alright so I enjoy talking about my

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,579
hobbies at conferences I've spoken about

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,199
launching weather balloons about

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,300
management controllers the Summer of

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,230
Code project so worked on to develop the

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,960
firmware that's recording this

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,060
conference right now I also given talks

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,130
on the random hacks I've done making my

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,170
Nintendo Play I've you bought in Chrome

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,430
to arms back in the day and more

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,790
recently playing on the insides of my

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,979
brand-new car so my other passion aside

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,390
from giving talks he's kind of sharing

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,710
my skills with other others and my

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,100
insights and so I was exposed to market

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,360
Python that by Carnegie 2016 last year

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,250
and I was just blown away by Damon

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,909
Damien's technical ability and its

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,040
enthusiasm I got really excited about

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,299
microcontrollers and using him you know

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,189
in a way hadn't been excited since

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,189
someone first showed me and we know way

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,350
back in the day and so that kind of led

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,240
from one thing to another to teaching

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,159
marker Python to 15 year olds at the

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,509
national computer science school and so

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,549
where we used to make very bit with

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,409
micro Python on it and this is a picture

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,840
of the web-based market emulator that

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,790
Jim is in the audience here demoed at

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,229
PyCon a year last year and Jim and Nicky

00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,939
actually just gave a talk about some of

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,840
this work over the education stream

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,540
about an hour ago this is Jim with micro

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
controllers strapped to him

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,270
this is what happens if you go and teach

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,820
the national computer science Summer

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,430
School and challenge the students to

00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,980
make you suffer they wire you up and

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,260
make you do exercise

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,210
so energy Houston Australia we've got

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,440
this grid that stretches from up in

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,150
Queensland down the east coast of

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
Australia over to South Australia and

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,240
along the way there's a bunch of

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,090
different generation equipment spread

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,170
out along the breadth of network and the

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,720
consumers are kind of similarly

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,830
disbursed in kind of clumps around the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,460
place and so last year we used about 900

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,440
petajoules of energy 250 terawatt-hours

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,640
depending on your sources and all this

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,650
energy is bought and sold on the

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,420
national electricity market and that's

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,100
the market determines the prices for

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,710
electrical energy that we use in our

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:55,760
homes and industries so one of the grid

00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,740
in South Australia I'm from South

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,010
Australia we recently got power not just

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,010
good

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,280
electricity's been a public use since

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,350
its 1855 in that life so it's not

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,660
actually that bad but that state's been

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,959
the news a bit recently on the topic of

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,280
electricity there's a fair chunk of our

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,570
electricity is generated by renewable

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,860
sources and it keeps on growing and

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,480
we've moved away from generating any

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,920
coal locally in that state so lots of

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,590
wind farms and a bit of rooftop solar so

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,180
as you can see this is from this morning

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,950
sao is generating about half its energy

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,980
from gas and the other half from wind

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,989
farms a little bit of small source at

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,700
rooftop solar on the end there in the LA

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,940
and since can see there's no coal

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,440
generation that makes at the moment also

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,060
tonight is not all of essays Energy's

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,959
source from within the state lots of it

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,690
come from the interconnect with the

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,360
eastern states but yes so why isn't I

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,720
call there was a gold station at Port

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:58,730
Augusta in the middle of the state there

00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:02,030
but they blew it up a few seconds so

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,770
this is this is a I've been putting us

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,459
sir about a year ago they they started

00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,900
knocking it down

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,900
says the big smokestack

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,350
bye-bye and so most of that's been

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,180
disassembled now and the coal mine that

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,889
was up at Tennant Creek has been kind of

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,290
closed and the township around that

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,310
closed and it's all kind of finished now

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,780
so upwards so replacing it literally

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,240
like about five kilometres next to that

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,760
valve power station is um is this

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,070
facility run by Sun Drop farms and so

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,380
concentrated solar farm so they collect

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,880
a bunch of solar using mirrors up on

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,340
that shiny collector in the middle there

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,820
and use their energy to heat greenhouses

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,919
and dis alone a order to grow tomatoes

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,180
essentially in the desert which is kind

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,310
of cool and when you drive along the

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,620
highway it's this kind of shining beacon

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,060
kind of to your right you have to be

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,910
careful not to swell if the road is your

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,530
kind of admirer but it is a pretty

00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,850
pretty cool piece of tech that's kind of

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,060
popped up there and and they're thinking

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,560
about building more of them so another

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,390
news wave no news about the event in

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,270
South Australia was the September 2016

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,790
storm that came across the state and it

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,020
knocked down the power lines up in the

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,940
north of state and through a series of

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,229
other failures the interconnects and all

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,110
generators were isolated from the grid

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,060
so if no power you can see there the SI

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,850
it's using 22 megawatts normally to be

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,250
using about 2,000 megawatts so energy

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,710
went essentially four zero or all that

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,270
work up in about three o'clock within

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,190
half an hour the mobile find out what

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,450
was so congested didn't work all the

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,039
streets were congested because there's

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,560
no traffic lights anymore and it took a

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,400
long time to come back so this is why

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,419
you know that doesn't work anymore

00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,000
illicit hours work

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,800
so the state was out with that power for

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,140
that evening a delayed came back on the

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,210
next day but some of the more regional

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,680
areas Fort Lincoln where I grew up took

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,610
about forty two hours before they had

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,890
power again so no phone supermarkets

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,630
rentee the army came in and distributed

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,830
rations from a Sports able because you

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,970
know things are looking pretty dire

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,220
there for a while isn't they when they

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,870
get the power back on so this is a bit

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,820
of a timeline of as they kind of

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,820
connected all the past the grid backup

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,770
and whatnot

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,560
she's very interesting but not we're

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,370
here to talk about today so other bit of

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,410
interesting news that happened the other

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,740
week was um this bloke came to town and

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,990
spoke about his batteries which is kind

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,820
of exciting so Tesla along with new jian

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,680
are building a well they've already

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,080
built a big wind farm and they're going

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,820
to connect a big-ass battery to it and

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
see what they can do to stabilize the

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,490
good using that which is it's pretty

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,890
interesting to see how that ago so the

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,960
great has been evolving in the country

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,060
and as Alaba ecology has been replaced

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,340
with new there's been trade offs and any

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,570
problems to be solved and one of the big

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,720
problems kind of at the forefront of

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,140
people's minds is is the impact of price

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,120
rises on the household kind of budget

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,220
and so you can see sa is at the top

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,610
there with um the the most expensive

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,830
prices in the state in the country and

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,990
so this kind of makes you think about

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,020
what can I do

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,510
you know can I can I reduce my bill

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,000
should I sold solar or storage or kind

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,680
of make my house up more efficient and

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,970
and when you start thinking that through

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,530
it's like well what's my consumption how

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,750
much am i using and so currently

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,420
everyone gets their consumption data

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,560
quarterly from the in the form of power

00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,940
bills that's my power bill there but how

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,470
do you can control for you know the

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,970
seasons changing and changing equipment

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,890
you know for instance I put a new fridge

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,210
in in December is that why my values has

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,550
gone down or is it because I was in

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,640
holiday in Sydney for most of summer you

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,050
know we don't know that and so it's hard

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,550
to see the impact for small changes as

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,180
the additive averaged across the four

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,530
months so I'm privileged to live in a

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,750
new home with good insulation

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,670
it's got LED lighting and one appliances

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,500
and you can see our usage is going down

00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,880
but like I said perhaps that's the

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,920
fridge how do we know and and so the

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,050
other thing to think about that we don't

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,000
get from our power bills is when are we

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,950
consuming you know he's overusing my

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,080
energy in the evening when it's dark so

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,710
solos not gonna help us we're using it

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,360
uniform across the day and things like

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,890
this and then there's other concerns you

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,160
know my brother recently had a child

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,270
sees energy bills went through the roof

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,430
and so it's thinking of what can I do

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,380
but is it used again is it using only

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,600
energy during the

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,800
while you know the kids at home or is it

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,780
that they're running the washing machine

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,790
late at night you just can't tell from

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:37,050
from your power bill and and so you know

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,550
you want to know where should you make

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,530
your investment another one that's my

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,150
parents have solar on their shed but

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,530
they've got this time little copper bit

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,750
of copper that takes it down to the grip

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,850
and they can't feed back in very well

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,650
and you know is that because the the

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,600
thin copper or is it because the grid

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,610
voltage happens to be really high in a

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,430
regional town that wasn't really sized

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,500
for for lots of homes having solar

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,490
feeding back into the grid so these

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,730
questions are pretty hard to answer

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,590
without a bit of data and so in addition

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,060
to knowing kind of the answer these

00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,160
questions I'm just knowing how much

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,780
we're using can influence behaviour as

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,520
well so you know we can we can save a

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,300
bit of energy by changing the way we're

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,190
using energy so Internet of Things yeah

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,720
it's gonna fix all their problems this

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,950
photos from my one of my favorite

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,630
Twitter accounts Internet of so it

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,860
shows a stack trace from a little

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,210
embedded Linux device on a tap as you do

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,830
seem to know things there's there's lots

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,840
of challenges there you know there's the

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,200
security issue you know we don't want

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,060
our LED lights to turn the botnets

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,560
there's this cost you know to be

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,930
competitive you need to drive costs down

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,220
but you also want to you know make sure

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,320
you've got something useful that someone

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,490
wants and connectivity is another

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,140
another big challenge

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,550
there's an interesting I'd lay startup

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,000
that's planning watching microsatellites

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,130
to do IOT conductivity we've got a

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,510
cellular network there's you know Wi-Fi

00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,250
it's different kinds of radios all these

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,810
kind of things how do you you know

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,300
integrate this and make it useful

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,960
there's money to be made and sensors are

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,700
fun I really like recording data so this

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,340
is this is my hat mile and room

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,230
temperature for the past year this was a

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,800
little micro Python project I set myself

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,970
a year ago to record the temperature

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,200
using an esp8266 I didn't really have

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,310
any plans for it just kind of set it up

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,750
and left it there and it's still sitting

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,940
there behind the bookshelf for recording

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,590
data so you can see summer comes and

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,700
winter comes it gets cooler got to see

00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,710
in the bottom right there that's a

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,990
normal weekday where you know we're at

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,010
work and the house hates up a little bit

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,830
because the sun's there and then we come

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,750
home and turn the a/c on Valley iron

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,170
then it turns off and you kind of say to

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,730
be all alone so that's kind of fun

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,340
there's all the types of data we can

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,550
look at this is a Python program project

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,530
by my friend called F boss and it looks

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,090
at your household expenditure you know

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,010
where your money's going ways spending

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,810
on bills we've seen on beer on

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:01,490
electronics on your computers and again

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,520
you know this looks to try and influence

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,900
behavior to work out you know can I kind

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,320
of change my spending habits to save a

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,550
bit of money smoke being again more data

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,080
they like collecting in my home so this

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,790
sits there and sends out a packet every

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,130
30 seconds to measure the round-trip

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:20,060
time - I think this is telecom from my

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,920
home wireless IP so maybe someone cut

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,840
down a tree in like late October last

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,720
year or something maybe there are some

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,700
cranes at a construction site in April

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,080
that the ping time go up but yeah so you

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,790
know interesting data and from this we

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,930
can gain kind of interesting insights so

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,190
we've got all this data how do I get the

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,220
same for my household energy monitoring

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,410
this is my medium the box outside my

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,980
house with a serial number wiped out I

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,540
just saw that before it came on to talk

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,190
so so this is the thing that the power

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,500
Network uses to give me my corley data

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,980
it has a nice little LED that blinks I

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,170
think every kilowatt that gets consumed

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,170
that's it's it's a little bit hard to

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,940
get into and it's not really generic so

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,110
so what else can we do because this

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,000
isn't a member of the Internet of Things

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,660
and it's also covered in these

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,310
scary-looking tamper proof devices that

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,330
make me kind of not want to touch it so

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,460
what can I do to measure my energy usage

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,100
this is a photocell from petition

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,770
additions in the crowd here his name's

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,800
gonna come off a couple times but um so

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,420
so this is this is his energy monitoring

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,230
setup that which I've replicated in my

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,340
home so we've got a an ESP - Eddie's SP

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,430
82 66

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,410
connect a little EDC there in the top of

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,420
the picture I've just dropped off the

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,470
Wi-Fi that's gonna screw up my talk and

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,600
so what that's doing it's got a current

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,920
plan so the big blue thing there is is

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,170
wrapped around one of the windings of

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,530
the the 240 volt cable that's going into

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,690
the dummy lobe

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:54,420
and so that's gonna measure the current

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,250
of that system it's also got a

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,060
transformer there and that's measuring a

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,460
step-down version of the voltage and so

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,260
we know that the power is voltage times

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,300
current so with OC numbers we can get

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,830
the power usage and the reason we want

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,240
to measure voltage as well as current is

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,940
that even though our grid is not only

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,650
230 volts it can go up by about 10

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,440
percent and down by 6 and still be

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,940
within spec and if you look at the data

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,890
it does drift a fair bit across the day

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,080
so well you could kind of ignore that

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,250
and assume I'm a link to 40 to 30 volts

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,660
if you want to get a nice accurate

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,040
reading you want to measure voltage as

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,990
well as the current so that feeds into

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,140
the live mode answer you which then can

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,230
post it to the service of your choice it

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,140
can do MQTT it can it can do it how to

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,020
be post you know you can make an ssh

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,820
connection to some box somewhere in this

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,640
case tsch was was I've learned two

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,290
things week which is a proprietary data

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,510
collection platform for doing internal

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,730
thinking so you can see here we've got

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,520
the current the voltage on the patoot

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,980
diagonals and the total power usage in

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,450
the bottom left there and so you

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,840
recording this over time you can start

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,520
seeing patterns in and working out you

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,470
know what time of day using power and

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,030
and what appliance is using what

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,980
appliance is a particularly energy

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:18,960
hungry and and which ones you don't need

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:21,270
to worry about this so well at the topic

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,850
of dish this is his card card supply

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,170
campaign so crud supplies a I'm kind of

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,090
an opener huh a very open hardware

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:31,680
friendly crowdfunding camp service the

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,670
boards that are using being used to

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,020
record this conference they were

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,750
financed through through the similar

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,760
program and Tish launched aggressive our

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,550
campaign on Monday to sell some of these

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,260
kits so he's got various you know the

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,090
little boards and whatever that that

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,920
could be put together to be used for

00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,570
energy monitoring so some of the

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,460
hardware simple as like a generic ADC

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,320
board but it goes all the way through to

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,580
these commercial power monitoring IC

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,500
similar kind of things that are in that

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,410
si Power Networks box that I showed you

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,090
earlier and they provide a bunch of

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,800
extra features on top of just measuring

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,470
some kind of voltage like an ADC does

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,230
you know

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,910
converter so the downside of getting

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,730
started with these devices has to she

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,220
explained to me was they you have to buy

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,290
some dev kit finders a box and that's no

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,960
good for a hobbyist like me I'm looking

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,670
to save money not spend more and so so

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,680
Tisha's put some of these on on little

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,410
dev boards that plug into you know like

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,760
a feather wing cell form factor or some

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,370
other kind of simple header that you can

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,900
use for prototyping so opening up energy

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,430
monitoring tomorrow enthusiasts which is

00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,260
pretty cool I think so there's a these

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,660
are some screenshots I'd stole from the

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,100
cursor low page so you can see some of

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,530
the kits and then a kind of an installed

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,150
set up that Tisha's got there with the

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:47,770
big black box is the the voltage

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,140
transformer so stepping down your 230

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,020
volts down to something that can be

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,910
sampled by America controller safely and

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,350
then outside the big scary you know box

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,880
you get electrician to touch you've got

00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,560
your nice little hobbyist bit that's

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
playing with low voltages and so that's

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,810
measuring the current and the voltage

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,070
there and so dish is a great lecture

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,390
engineer and it's a good software

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,640
engineer but he doesn't use a macro

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,950
Python so I thought hey I can help him

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,210
out here I like putting like a Python to

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:18,040
random little things let's let's see

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:22,690
what we can do here so in comes the

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,130
maracas - Damian showed us how easy it

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,650
is to get a sense of demo up and running

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,030
if you're here for his talk this morning

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,800
and I agree you know my temperature

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,570
monitor took me an hour or so and it's

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,740
been running for a year that's the round

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,470
room temperature sensor I showed you

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,380
before and so I got hold of an Adafruit

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,570
huzzah so this is this some kind of

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,480
jeweled inline form factor dev board

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:47,400
whether with an ESP module on it and

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,810
that runs this circuit Python a fork of

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,810
micro Python that's developed by

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,270
Adafruit and so it's got a little nice

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,210
little LCD display on there and the the

00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:01,510
Python module was was you know ported

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,950
it's a circuit python excuse me and and

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,310
looked like it be good to go but I tried

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,780
to get it going and my dice so I'd hit a

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,040
compatibility issue where the module was

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,380
written for an older version of their

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,910
microbiome framework and to save RAM

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,049
that ripped out that functionality from

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,839
the the C code from the binary that you

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:21,959
but the binary you have and so I was

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,720
stuck and a couple of frustrating

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,309
evenings of hacking Irie implemented it

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,919
you know started adding a bit of Python

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,299
so I could still use that module the

00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,220
module supported things like you know

00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,649
color displays and frame buffer flipping

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,330
and all this kind of gear that for a 32

00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:38,249
by 64 character display we definitely

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,070
didn't need and I managed to get it

00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:42,929
going again and this is kind of one of

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,149
the the challenges we have in micro

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,279
Python land is deciding what to include

00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:49,950
in the image in a in a flash an array of

00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,359
constrained environment so these guys

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,100
had made a decision to chop this bit out

00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,509
but it did mean that useful

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,619
functionality that should have been kind

00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,769
of plug-and-play and off we go

00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,049
didn't work and for hobbyists that

00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:02,759
that's not a great thing you know it

00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,159
takes a lot of the momentum out of out

00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,159
of your hacking after hours and slows

00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:11,129
you down a lot I did send a pull request

00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:13,289
and they fixed it up and and I gave a

00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,940
talk earlier today where she used a very

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,350
similar module and it was plug and play

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,029
for her so it's good to see that's being

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,470
resolved I was just obviously there on

00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:24,239
this nice transition period between the

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,679
they are the new and the old so that was

00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,039
one of my kind of challenges with this

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,679
board

00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,539
so I decided switch boards to see what

00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,690
what else was going on again

00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,149
dishes source of all my little toys he

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,389
lent me this low pie board so it's a SP

00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:41,820
32 coupled with the Laura Radio so this

00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:44,609
is the proprietary 90 megahertz spread

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,070
spectrum a little radio module very

00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,239
popular internet of things circles we

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,039
happen to use it for my weather balloon

00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:51,629
project to do the downlink so we had one

00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,600
of these floating 30 40 guys in the air

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:57,690
down linking data to an antenna on the

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,809
back of a car and so they use micro

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,999
Python which which makes them cool they

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,590
they unfortunately a bit late Adafruit

00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,149
had gone forked Marco Python though so

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,789
they had their own version of the

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:12,869
documentation the documentation kinda

00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:14,850
mentioned SPI the SP 32 has 4 SPI of SPI

00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,049
ports it kind of mentioned them but then

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,879
somewhere else it kind of alluded to the

00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,210
fact the lordship is connected via SPI

00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:22,919
and so you couldn't use the SPI ports

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,480
and the documentation linked to the

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,100
microbiome during current documentation

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,990
which obvious didn't work on this board

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,340
there since updated the documentation

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,900
now it just links back to the own page

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,400
the same page already on it doesn't

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,840
actually take you anyway

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,770
I'm not sure if that's an improvement at

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,660
least you're not gonna waste your time

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,490
implementing something doesn't work but

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,530
this is this is another one of the

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,530
challenges that I've kind of had to face

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:47,140
in going through this project where when

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,669
you're using these these micro Python

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,289
and a microphone board for something

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,299
that someone else has done whatever I

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,980
feel the hard bits it's it's so much fun

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,419
to use it just works out the box

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,640
but when you're trying to do something

00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:00,039
that's not quite the same another

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,230
example as I was trying to use this

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:06,490
module with a board that was designed

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,200
for an esp8266 and the AG 266 didn't

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,600
have as many hardware you arts so the

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,559
common way to use serial with that was

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,880
software serial the ASP 32 has lots of

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,140
hardware serials so they're like ah now

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,230
we don't have a software serial module

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,419
for the SP 32 but that's no good if the

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,450
the dev board there test right there

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:27,909
yeah the feather wing board that I'm

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,280
using doesn't have the right pins

00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,720
connected to the hardware you arts and

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,980
so again I was back at square one

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,179
unable to kind of proceed and so as a

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,260
professional kind of a bit of software

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:41,320
person these are the kind of challenges

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,140
we deal with all the time but as a

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,669
hobbyist you um you kind of expect a

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,520
little bit of a smoother ramp I guess

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,960
sometimes it's not like using the SP I

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,010
thought was that stranger thing to be

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,780
doing for a little bit of embedded

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,520
hardware so it's definitely something

00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:01,870
where the the micro Python ecosystem

00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:04,470
needs to evolve I think so I kind of did

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,270
get it working this is my test that up

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,049
my electrician friends had a fit when

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,940
they saw this attached to that orange

00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,740
cable there is a current clamp so I

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,480
broke out one of the windings from the

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,690
240 volts myself and attached the

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,400
current plan and then used on the

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,440
toasters the toasters you know nicely

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,510
isolated away from anything else on my

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,049
living room floor but perhaps not as

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,490
well as late as it could be didn't

00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:33,280
surface mic alarms didn't wake my

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,240
partner so that was so good and so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,530
that's kind of where I'm out at the

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,030
project the moment unfortunately I don't

00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,530
have a nice happy conclusion where I can

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,999
say I'm now using microbial energy

00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:44,089
monitoring my home maybe that's a

00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:47,299
and they talked for the next PyCon but

00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:49,399
but that's kind of where we ended up so

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,109
that was all the prepared material I had

00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:52,879
there's some links if you're going to go

00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,689
check out tissues stuff which I

00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,609
encourage you to do

00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:57,859
I'll go hassle him at the end of the

00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:00,349
talk there's my twitter account if you

00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,149
wanna point out where I was wrong though

00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:04,519
what I did wrong with using these big

00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:08,149
modules I'd be happy to to be shown the

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,409
light but yeah I'd like to open up some

00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:10,819
questions and it's kind of trading of

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:25,339
all stories if anyone else wants to chat

00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:27,259
about that that's all is a really

00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:33,649
interesting feel for me I've been

00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:37,719
looking at the Iman system the one that

00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:40,309
I I have had trouble tracking down those

00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:44,959
what I really like his sort of per

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:47,449
circuit monitoring in the home and I'd

00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:50,379
heard that there were devices out there

00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:53,649
like that replaced the circuit breaker

00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:57,409
with a module which could then get

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:58,939
information out of it have you seen any

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,359
like thing like that and what what are

00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:03,409
they called and what do I Google I

00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,609
haven't seen anything that replaces the

00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:06,799
second break I'm trying to find a

00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,279
specific slide and I can't see it one of

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,849
the modules teachers built is a din rail

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:16,849
system so that's the physical mounts you

00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:19,669
have in your power meter box so that

00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:22,309
that is no good for it doesn't replace

00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:23,719
the circuit breaker but you could use

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,329
that kind of form factor thing to have a

00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:29,089
series of these are for each circuit in

00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:31,549
your home but yeah I haven't gone down

00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,899
that route I mean it it would be that

00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,579
would be the ultimate to have every

00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:37,669
single device another way to do it

00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:41,089
though is Tish wants to respond I think

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:45,469
he's come up the front Tish he's got one

00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:47,929
here to demo so another way do that is

00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:49,399
to use these maths so there's machine

00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,139
learning techniques that can pick out

00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,820
individual so this is what I'm trying to

00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,100
find a picture of

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,169
handling one the flesh instead so this

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,299
kind of looks like a fuse thing you've

00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,519
got in fuse made a box it's got a nice

00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:03,320
little LED display on there to give you

00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,759
a real-time readout and it's it's got

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,799
the same guts as I was showing you

00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,090
photos of earlier this is one of the

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,570
things you can buy in is user

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,679
outsourcing campaign so yet like I'm

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,720
saying that one of the other techniques

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,399
is instead of monitoring a Chan dividual

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,899
circuit you use a bit of machine

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:20,269
learning to extract out the information

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:22,759
you've got there and and teach the

00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,009
system what which appliances are which

00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,509
and obviously the more data you collect

00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:28,460
the more accurate the model can be and

00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:29,899
so at that point maybe you can tell what

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,820
some individual circuits even though you

00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:39,049
don't have monitoring an average

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:42,500
individual port I think there was a

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,720
company in Perth that is starting up

00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,710
that would basically you just attach a

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,269
device to like a current plan and it

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:54,320
samples it's something like 500

00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:57,559
kilohertz and with that it can actually

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,009
recognize the signature of various DC

00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,929
converters various motors starting up AC

00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:05,929
induction motors all that sort of stuff

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:08,539
and can actually then pick out the

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:12,100
signature of those devices but that's

00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:15,409
still as far as I can see see

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,750
Kickstarter where and hasn't actually

00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:21,110
made it to production in shop kind of

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,570
stuffs you here but yeah this is a great

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:33,049
pub conversation one I miss anything of

00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:35,000
you yeah I did a little bit of research

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,669
on a similar thing and I found that in

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,509
in Victoria there is one type of power

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:44,149
meter that has a zigboo unifies and

00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:45,679
there are so as you can get that will

00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:48,500
communicate with a bit apparently if you

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,080
go to the power company you can get the

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,590
you can get ZigBee enabled on you on

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,029
your meter okay and I believe that there

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,649
are ZigBee modules that you can get

00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,790
potentially there could be a possibility

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:00,410
to

00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:04,010
striking information from the motor oof

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,570
yeah I mean as a kid just who's bought a

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,130
brand new home I wish there was the

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,480
option of picking which meter I had

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,220
because there are meters that are a lot

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,330
easier to get the data out than reading

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,240
the the pulse but didn't have that

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,750
choice so yeah sort of interested in a

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,010
same concept but haven't really pursued

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,600
it is a bit unfortunate that all the

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,630
hardware sitting in the box there and

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,190
and the data is not made available I

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,900
mean that the power company can't really

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,720
get the data the hold of that reading

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,620
out is the quarterly usage even though

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,500
in theory it could be sitting there

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,900
logging in and and this is something

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,130
that might go forward literally read an

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,910
article as I was walking into the talk

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,830
today on ABC News about um voluntary

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,990
load shedding for this summer so if you

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,940
go to an agreement to say I'll turn off

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,450
my air conditioner in my full pump when

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,250
when it's a hot summer's day and that's

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,960
all well and good to have people promise

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,810
but if you can record people's actual

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,270
usage and and they're not using power

00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:03,920
you can reward them in that way so that

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,110
will be interesting to see and that is a

00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,720
young it's a positive Internet of Things

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:13,850
application you know it's not a internet

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:17,200
enabled dish tap or something like that

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,200
so yeah oh they'll be cool to see

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,530
it's a great great talk interesting

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:30,170
interesting topic I've been I've just

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,630
spent a lot of money to start up our my

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,990
house for the test of power wall but the

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:39,340
in in individual devices a challenge and

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:43,300
I see you using a clamp so generally

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:45,770
what I've seen is clamps are inaccurate

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,590
mostly are there any other devices well

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,120
how do you get round the perception that

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,430
clamps are not necessarily going to be

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,550
giving you accurate data on what the

00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,730
devices are doing I can't really speak

00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:07,190
to the accuracy of clamps

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:09,590
grab the mic so clamps can be up to 0.5

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,020
percent accurate so for higher accuracy

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,540
typically you get these shunts current

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,390
shunts and difficulty with current

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,390
shunts it makes the meter physically big

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,640
so the current shunt has to pass 80 amps

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,800
or however many amps you're pulling so

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
the clamp there is rated at hundred amps

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,330
so it just makes the metering Hardware

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,640
big and with the clamps you're moving

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,340
the lumpiness away to somewhere you

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,700
can't get 0.5% clamps this clamp I have

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:42,500
is a 5% clamp it's meant for not

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,600
metering but advisory purposes so you

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,760
can just get more accurate more

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:52,250
expensive clamps to get better better

00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,500
quality sorry

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,299
no you can use shots as I said you can

00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,100
use like a small resistor which has very

00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,710
low resistance and you can measure the

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,470
voltage drop across it that is capable

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:06,200
of that the item 19 is capable of using

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,539
shunts as that source for measuring how

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,020
much current you're using and Chancellor

00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:15,100
point zero one percent accurate thanks

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,900
guys there was a question just here

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,460
thanks for the nice talk I work in

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,460
energy monitoring and it's really nice

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,130
to see some open hardware coming out so

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,900
I was wondering with the NY your end

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,210
idea is to monitor your household

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,039
consumption are you actually able to

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,710
install it in the meter box yourself who

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,830
would you need to get an electrician out

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:40,480
so yet the answer is no and that's I'll

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:46,789
go back to the slide of tissue setup

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:49,520
where the right so you can see there all

00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:51,049
the the 240 volt stuff or 230 volt stuff

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,970
is inside the box that's what you get

00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:55,460
the electrician to do maybe out to the

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,440
right is is low voltage and so that's

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,159
what you as a hobbyist you know an

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,840
unlicensed down person can do and so you

00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,549
it's also one phase device so if you

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,340
want to monitor multiple channels or

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,720
multiple phases you need to get more

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,720
devices okay

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:24,360
for the whole product justice for the

00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,770
video Tish has told us that you can get

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,240
devices that do multiple phases as well

00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,940
as the single phase one so this cost a

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,340
little bit more right thank you

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:39,700
Thanks all right all right thanks again

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,290
Joe for a fascinating talk and for our

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:49,710
appreciation I thank you

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:49,710
