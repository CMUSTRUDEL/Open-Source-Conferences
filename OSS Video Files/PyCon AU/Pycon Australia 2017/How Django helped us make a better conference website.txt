okay hi everyone my name is Danish I'll

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,269
be the session chair for the next three

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,429
talks so first up we have Christopher

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,900
neugebauer

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:15,780
Chris is an Australian programmer from

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,550
the tasmanian city of Hobart he's worked

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,740
on mobile development focusing on

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,230
Android and over the last year has been

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,960
knee-deep in back-end web development

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,939
with Jenga he's been a past board member

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,179
with Linux Australia and has been a

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,660
fellow of the Python Software Foundation

00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,660
since 2013

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:39,750
thank you very much thank you yes I was

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,820
mentioned I am Christopher no I give our

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,840
my twitter handle is cleverly hidden on

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,399
the slide here

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,719
I'll let you figure out what it is for

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,059
just a moment while I talk a bit more

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,940
about myself one thing that wasn't in

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,430
the bio that danish mentioned is that i

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,329
am a serial conference organiser i've

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,250
been deeply involved with PyCon

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,620
australia since 2012

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,670
first as co-lead organizer for a couple

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,770
of years and then as a person who does

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,159
whatever other people on the committee

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,869
don't volunteer to do in order to keep

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,670
the thing running I ran linux.com

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,759
fertile a year earlier this year in

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,939
Hobart and since then I've moved to the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,009
San Francisco Bay Area where I am

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,390
running the very first North Bay Python

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,670
conference which is all to say that like

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,979
I feel like I'm qualified to talk about

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,780
building conference websites and today

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm going to talk about a project that

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,909
we did with Lynx calm today you this

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,380
year replacing the an existing text

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,810
stack with something that was based on

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,090
Django

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,369
so conference tech is a really narrow

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,750
topic which is you know it surprises me

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,890
that there is many people in this room

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,659
as there are thank you for coming along

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,579
it's a narrow talk with broader lessons

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,799
and to make it better for you rather

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,719
speaking specifically about conference

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,780
tech I'm gonna use conference management

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,439
software as somewhat of a case study in

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,400
building up a new software project using

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,150
Django and we're taking this approach

00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,879
for two reasons

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,110
the first is that conference websites

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,420
are an inherently boring topic yet they

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,120
do a lot of things that most small

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,610
websites will probably need to do there

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,579
is a lot of basic crud tasks and

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,470
creating stuff like profiles and and

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,790
reading them in using them and deleting

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,590
them and those sorts of things and

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,629
there's basic content management and

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,209
then there's a few specialist tasks that

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,190
require a specialist software to be

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,319
written in order to solve those tasks

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,579
the domain-specific sort of stuff and

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,440
the other thing is that if you are here

00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,760
in this room at the moment which you are

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,640
unless you're watching it on the video

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,109
hi people on the video you've used a

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,930
conference management site almost

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,700
certainly in particular if you are here

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,920
in this room today you have used the

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,349
exact tech stack that I'm going to be

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,659
talking about and if you were here last

00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:08,590
year you have probably used the stack

00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,390
that I'm going to be talking about

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,530
replacing so there is a good chance that

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,470
you have some experience with the

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,940
software that I'm talking about which

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,400
makes it a particularly good thing Freya

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,709
a case study and so maybe you you need

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,299
to make some similar decisions what I'll

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,810
be talking about is somewhat of a first

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:28,599
principles approach to why you choose to

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,000
base a reasonably non-trivial sight upon

00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,239
Django and so I'm going to talk about

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,120
what Django did for us and how Django

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,540
itself made it really easy to make that

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,540
switch

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:47,139
so first up some background why this

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:50,019
project why did it need to happen so

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,400
first up Linux conf au it's a community

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,819
organized free and open source software

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,540
conference it's been running since 1999

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,849
and it runs in a different city every

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,239
single year and it runs with a different

00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,819
organizing committee every single year

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,609
and Linux cough darling who has a very

00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,430
strong emphasis on doing things with a

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:15,250
free or open source software wherever

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,949
possible it's been somewhat of a

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,380
front-runner of a lot of conferences in

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,300
that it's sold tickets and such via the

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,310
internet for a very very long time and

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,020
it predates a lot of the services that

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,800
people use to run conferences like

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,530
Eventbrite like

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,919
stripe those sorts of things by a number

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,889
of years Pike on Australia is the

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,440
conference that you are currently at as

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,909
I mentioned earlier I've I was a lead

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,830
organizer of it in 2012 along with

00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:44,050
Joshua Hesketh it's a it's a Python

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,449
conference and being a Python conference

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,949
one of our remits is as well as being a

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:49,659
place where people come along to learn

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,240
about Python how to use Python have it

00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:54,310
developed Python is to support

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,750
development of Python open source

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,490
software and to increase the amount of

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,009
Python open source software that is out

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,479
there being used and being developed and

00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,840
both of these happen to be organized by

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,180
Linux Australia so there's a fairly

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,590
strong overlap in in the organizing

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,900
communities of both of these conferences

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,610
and so these are both conferences that's

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,409
the thing they have in common they need

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,270
to do conference e stuff so you need to

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,590
be able to buy tickets from them you

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,879
need to be able to ask people for the

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,979
talks they're going to submit you need

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,440
to do those sorts of things most

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:29,020
conferences including LCA and including

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,419
Python Australia do they do these things

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,830
through websites and they have some sort

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,539
of commitment to developing their own

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,259
software and building a community around

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:40,509
it so so using software as a service

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,620
sort of stuff has generally been out of

00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,139
the question for both of these

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,759
conferences and so we definitely had

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,729
software that did the sorts of things

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,440
that a conference needs to do but we

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,940
replaced it and so before we talk about

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,370
Django I'm going to talk a bit about

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,099
these software that we that we replaced

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,919
and that software was called zookeeper

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,539
it's a conference management system it

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,120
was written for Linux confetti you

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:08,469
originally and PyCon Australia became a

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,139
user of zookeeper starting in 2012 the

00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:14,650
year that we took over so zookeepers

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:18,870
first release was in 2007 and generally

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,190
its development path was was defined by

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,319
changing of conference teams in

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,699
different cities for each year so

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,860
there'd be as incremental development

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,080
and with each year there'd be a

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,979
relatively high level of turnover of the

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,839
core developers on the conference each

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,060
year new developers tended to relearn

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,740
aspects of the system and adding things

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,800
to the system fairly early on in the

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,919
year

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,899
from what I could gather there wasn't a

00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:48,559
lot of broad-scale planning from year to

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:50,869
year of that and zookeeper was quite old

00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:53,930
it made a bunch of technology decisions

00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,969
that made sense in 2007 but technology

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,919
moves fast and even the decisions that

00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:01,460
you make in 1 year might not necessarily

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:06,009
be decisions that you would make at some

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,059
point in the future and there was a

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,589
there was getting to a point where

00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,819
zookeeper depended on quite old

00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:12,050
components and it made it quite

00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,569
difficult to set up development

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,449
environments it made it quite difficult

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:20,959
to track security updates for four

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,969
components and zookeeper was designed in

00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,249
a monolithic fashion so a lot of the

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:28,339
features that zookeeper had would be

00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:29,689
built into zookeeper itself the various

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,219
components of zookeeper weren't

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,860
particularly ex trickable so if you

00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,209
wanted to have one feature of zookeeper

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,419
you needed to have the entire thing

00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,189
around as well for example if you you

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,020
wanted to build a wiki you would need to

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,759
either build it into zookeeper all you'd

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,009
need to shim a separate unrelated

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,229
software package along the side of it

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:53,990
and so when the 2017 team came along to

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,789
linux configure it was clear to us that

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,519
we either needed to do a very large

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,219
overhaul of zookeeper 2 to fix a lot of

00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,769
features in it or to come up with a

00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:05,240
fully-fledged replacement and after some

00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:08,689
discussion with the team we came to the

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,519
conclusion that we should replace a

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,519
zookeeper rather than doing an overhaul

00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:17,330
I gave a talk about the decision making

00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,129
process that that we came to that helped

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,869
us make this decision last year at PyCon

00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,419
Australia you can find the video online

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:25,519
on YouTube and we made the decision to

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,289
replace zookeeper with a python-based

00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:35,449
stack that's so with their Django based

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:37,610
stack so let's talk a bit about why we

00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:40,250
made a decision to move to a Django

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,620
based stack so the first reason is that

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,810
Django first and foremost is a modern

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,110
web development framework there are

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,420
major releases of Django basically every

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,820
year maybe slightly more often there are

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,060
security updates for Django that

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,450
preserve backwards compatibility and and

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,340
it's relatively easy to to upgrade

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,260
between versions of Django as long as

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,860
you as long as you track them on a

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,240
relatively frequent basis zoo keepers

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,130
development environment as I mentioned

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,570
before was notoriously difficult to set

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,140
up and that was somewhat of a barrier to

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,040
entry for new contributors coming along

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,170
building off a modern up-to-date

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,700
framework means base to install the

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,610
development environment you could

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,250
actually use modern development best

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,380
practices so if you wanted to get our

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,260
website and run it on your local machine

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,720
it was basically as easy as running pip

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,430
inside a virtual end in practice this

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,690
was not entirely the case but it would

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,800
get you about 95% of the way there and I

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,490
that's the thing that we're working upon

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,380
improving architectural II and this is

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,420
actually very very important to us is

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,970
that Django sites are constructed out of

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,610
numerous django apps these are

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,810
effectively plugins so because django is

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,550
popular at the moment people have

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,020
already written apps for a lot of common

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,700
tasks that you might want to solve and

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,440
it's relatively easy to pick and choose

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,510
the best components for your purposes

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,410
and build them into the website that

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,290
you're going to do work that you're

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,910
going to deploy it basically means that

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,010
if someone has solved a problem that you

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,600
have probably multiple people have

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,190
solved the problems that you have you

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,020
can go and choose the components that

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,610
best suit your needs and then you only

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,670
need to go and write the things that

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,530
don't yet exist basically django gave us

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,800
the freedom to work on aspects of the

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,140
site that we needed to work on and we're

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,100
able to leave the rest of it to the

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,870
experts so you might have gathered this

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,550
already a key decision for us using

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,680
Django was that we could adopt apps the

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,900
people had already written and I'm going

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,250
to talk you through a bunch of the bunch

00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:45,140
of things that we used in the website so

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,660
as I mentioned conferences are in the

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,600
business of running conferences and not

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,540
writing content management systems and

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,570
Django has a lot of CMS applications out

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,880
there that plug into Django sites we

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,160
chose wagtail which is a Django based

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,860
CMS that one of our team members already

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,800
had fairly extensive experience in using

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,600
and recommended it to

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
so in the bread-and-butter pages of

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,410
websites we know the walls of text sorts

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,510
of things we have lots of text a few

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,310
images those sorts of things they're

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,350
properly catered for by wagtail and we

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,730
have a bunch of those like how tell us

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,580
about the conference tell us about the

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,470
city those sorts of things but our web

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,260
designers came up with a really

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,640
interesting design for the front page

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,530
using these these panels now some of

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,820
these panels would be blue with a

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,620
photographic background and have a

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,580
picture in it on the left and some of

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,770
them will be white without a

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,270
photographic background and then at some

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,250
point later on we need to introduce the

00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,040
keynote speakers which breaks that panel

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:46,100
approach and they have a design of their

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,960
own and wagtail actually made it really

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,910
really easy for us to build up a site

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,120
that or build up a page that use these

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,260
various views these various panels

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,120
unless you design page structures

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,550
basically like their django models which

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,500
is great and this stream field thing

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,420
lets you make pages that consist of

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,220
repeating mixed content bits of content

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,900
so I can't want to say here is one of

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,020
those panels so show us the panel or

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,840
show us the keynotes and from those

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,060
models wagtail it gives you a really

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,930
really nice editing interface for free

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,850
it's like on a par with WordPress how

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,730
good it is and it builds up an editor

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,560
that is based around based around the

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,000
models that you have so you can see that

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,290
we can add in a basic content panel like

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,970
like we described or we can add in one

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,920
of those keynote blocks and that builds

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,850
up all the fields for the things and so

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,620
you can actually build up those

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,690
structured pages in a really really nice

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,240
way without having to mess around with

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:45,170
the HTML for the for the page like you

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,700
would have to with a flat CMS and we

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,440
also had a bunch of pages that were not

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,000
controlled by wagtail themselves but we

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,860
wanted to make it easy to update the

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,990
text on them as we needed to so the

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,570
presentation list was built up by a

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,760
different Sun built up by a different

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,650
application but we also wanted to have

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,080
this this text in here want to be able

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,270
to change it and so wagtail has snippets

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,150
which is a feature where you can edit

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:12,440
arbitrary bits of text inside the CMS

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:14,270
editor the CMS management system and it

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,640
would replace the text that appears on

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,350
those various pages and so you basically

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,720
go and create a Django model

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,460
with the with the stuff that you want to

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,890
store and then you get an editor for it

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,630
and it's really nice and you can manage

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,530
it without having to go into the Django

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,820
admin interface of those sorts of things

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,710
so one of the things that Linux conf a

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,780
you does from year to year is give

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,060
attendees a wiki that they can use to

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:41,000
organize things like birds of a feather

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,910
session things like that under zookeeper

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,180
what would tend to happen was they'd

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,270
they take a standalone wiki program like

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,790
like media wiki or Moin Moin wiki and

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,100
they they patch in the authentication

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,570
from zookeeper into that and so make it

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,000
so you could go from one to the other

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,830
relatively easily but the pages would

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,470
look completely different if you're on

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,140
the wiki versus the main website for LCA

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,750
2017 we're able to drop in django wiki

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,300
which is a django based wiki believe it

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,740
or not and we can make it look like it

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,240
was part of the conference site because

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,670
we could just drop it into Django

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,980
templates relatively easy basically was

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,570
part of the conference site and so we're

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,980
able to basically make the wiki pages

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,930
look like they were part of the rest of

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,460
the conference site which was kind of

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,320
great so as it turns out as well as four

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,810
really really generic tasks

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,450
there are also django apps for managing

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,210
conferences themselves and the one that

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,530
we use is called symposium symposium was

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,890
commissioned by the Python Software

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,840
Foundation for PyCon us in 2012 it's

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,140
been used by PyCon amongst other

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,410
conferences including PI Ohio including

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,910
Kiwi PyCon for a number of years now

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,190
it's actively maintained it has a

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,200
commercial sponsor and there's a bunch

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,380
of conferences that are out there using

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,210
it and symposium did a lot of the things

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,130
that zookeeper already did for us that

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,330
was specialized conference management

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,430
tasks we could do things like managing

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,620
the call for proposals managing and

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,570
publishing the schedule and we were also

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,030
able to do something we hadn't done

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,610
before which is do basic session staff

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,520
management so we're able to have people

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,120
opt into to session chairing given talks

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,740
through the conference website and one

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,660
of the things that we benefited from is

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,180
that we're now using a stack that not

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,490
just Pike on a you and links conf a you

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,740
use but numerous other conferences out

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,480
there used and and they've developed on

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,340
symposium themselves and so there are

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,800
features in symposium that we'd never

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,140
have thought about adding in zookeeper

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,910
that we're able to get for free and that

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,920
we were able to make use of because

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,910
other conferences had found them to be a

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,830
useful thing and we were able to rely on

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,470
the broader community to write and to

00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,090
maintain that software so it reduced the

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,370
maintenance burden on on us as

00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,050
conference organizers and it increased

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,550
the overall quality of the software that

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,010
we use and that's a huge win because

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,990
we're conference organizers we want to

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:14,690
run conferences and not spend our time

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:16,220
keeping software up-to-date so despite

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,050
getting all this existing functionality

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,850
when we switched away from zukie but we

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,730
still lost a bit of functionality not

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,490
everything that we wanted was the thing

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,230
that was already out there for us and

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,730
the main result of what Lynx comforted a

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,820
you did last year is a project called

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,700
registration it's a registration package

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:39,020
for symposium it sells tickets for

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,520
conferences I wrote a lot of that and

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,200
you can talk to me about it but a lot of

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,000
the stuff it does is relatively dry but

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,080
it appears fairly boring to people using

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,780
it so I'm not going to dwell on it too

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,840
much but one of the problems with

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,850
zookeeper as a ticket sales platform is

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,100
something that manifested that that's

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,140
manifesting in conferences which is that

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,610
ticket sales tend to happen very very

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,220
late in the conference management

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,750
lifecycle so like you start your open

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,150
ticket says in October for a January

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,980
conference and absolutely every single

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,170
task involved in running a conference

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,940
happens at that particular point and

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,740
suddenly the people have been working on

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,040
code and no longer free to work on code

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,660
and solve the problems that come up so

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,310
these things never get solved we were

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,750
able to rewrite from the ground up and

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,060
what that meant was that we were able to

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,420
focus on solving actual problems that

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,370
happen here upon year one metric that

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,920
I'm particularly proud of is that we're

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:35,480
able to completely eliminate a support

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,370
load that occurred year upon year with

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,740
every PyCon au I'd been involved with in

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,960
with every linux.com today.you I'd

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,330
spoken to organizers of we completely

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,660
eliminated that source that that support

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,520
load by being able to focus

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,370
on solving the problems by changing

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,470
workflows and basically because

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,790
everything else is community managed we

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,710
were able to work on the ticket sales

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,780
software without what worrying about

00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,400
maintaining everything else that's meant

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,950
that we've been able to fix issues and

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,850
improve that software so let's finish up

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,290
by talking a bit about how we went I

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,790
personally feel as though the project to

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,500
move away from zookeeper and over to

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,170
symposium a know Django based frame

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,210
Django based site by all accounts went

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,090
pretty well here's a few of the things

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,370
that I thought were particularly good so

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,830
when you adopt new software there's

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,150
always teething issues if you you move

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,210
away from something you you lose

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,590
features that people have got used to

00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,390
you know functionality of people have

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,150
depended upon particularly the papers

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,250
review process went away when we moved

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,520
over to symposium generally we were able

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,990
to make changes that program reviewers

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,170
complained about and wanted us to fix

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,480
very very quickly you know we're able to

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,900
make those changes and get them deployed

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,520
in a very easy basis generally our

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,270
organizers fought less with the software

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,400
as I mentioned before we reduced a lot

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,620
of support load that we'd experienced in

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,150
past in previous years by thinking about

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,980
solving the problems that had been

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,480
recurring with ticket sales a year upon

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,400
year as we approach the conference we

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,040
started having attendees looking even

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,480
closer at the website and being a tech

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,700
conference you tend to have people

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,040
complain about tech this is something

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,560
that happens and attendees notice that

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,630
they were features missing we were able

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,670
to immediately point our attendees at

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,050
the github repo for our website we were

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,450
developing out in the open for the

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:35,100
entire year we were able to ask them for

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:38,160
patches and and then we would merge pull

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,870
requests as they came in and this

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,150
happened at least twice during the

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,220
conference we got an improved iCal feed

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,430
from an attendee and we got a bunch of

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,080
CSS improvements this speaks to how easy

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,030
it was for our attendees to create a

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:56,280
development environment and get up to

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:58,080
speed on the system its successful to

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,030
the points that other conferences have

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,170
adopted our suite

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:07,200
PyCon au 2017 has used the LCA 2017

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,350
suite on a wholesale basis it's using

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,080
everything that we used I gather that

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,470
LCA 2018 is using some of the features

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,230
that we used but not all of them and I'm

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,059
informed that we will be using the suite

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,800
for North Bay Python probably because

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,420
I'm somewhat involved with it but I'm

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,410
not involved in PI oh hi oh and they've

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,040
said that they're probably going to

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,270
adopt our as sweet as well you may be

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,320
wondering what things we probably

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,630
wouldn't do again in general I feel as

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,910
though there's not a lot that we

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:43,800
definitely wouldn't do except probably

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,030
around with a full-blown CMS CMS has

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,000
solve a problem where you have multiple

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,260
collaborators working on a page and some

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,510
of them might not be entirely

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,770
technically inclined in practice we

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,200
didn't have all that many people

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,050
updating copy on the site itself in fact

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,610
it was it was mostly just me even with

00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,960
one other collaborator in our

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,600
environment because everyone is

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,510
relatively technically proficient

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,650
working on a pool requests based

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,530
workflow might have made a bunch more

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,179
sense and so doing that always static

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,100
pages and pull requests to update the

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,710
site probably would have work just as

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,390
well as having a proper CMS Django has

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,490
template views which allows you to just

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,309
load a Django template and not have any

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,900
any logic behind it and that they're

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,630
pretty good for static content and they

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,920
allow for a pull request based workflow

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,660
I'm probably going to be using that for

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Northbay Python rather than wagtail

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,380
that's basically the only thing that I

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,970
would probably probably change in

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,590
hindsight that is all the prepared

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,260
content I have and I am now happy to

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:49,370
answer questions anyone got questions

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,370
feel free to applaud if you want to

00:21:51,620 --> 00:22:05,070
one of you seem to be itching to applaud

00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:08,100
there so questions so you mentioned at

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,930
the start based on the history that it

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,730
predates things like Eventbrite and Tito

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,500
and other sites does it solve this

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,210
problem yes are there still things in

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,190
that space you think you'd want to pull

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,650
over or do you think you're diverging

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,750
from the more general ticketing system

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,580
that they much more focus on ticketing

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,600
rather than sight organization is this

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,690
so in terms of in terms of conference

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,280
tickets there are some conferences where

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,570
the only thing that you the only thing

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,100
that's attached to the conference is the

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,570
conference itself so you sharp to the

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,430
you show up to the conference and

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,750
everyone shows up to the same thing and

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,250
you might sell different classes of

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:46,230
tickets for that PyCon a you and Linux

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,900
confer you have relatively complicated

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,910
tickets that riff that reflect the the

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,570
structure of the event and I wasn't

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:56,430
really able to find anything that that

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:59,160
dealt with sort of the ticket inclusions

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,620
that we have and the various sub events

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,130
that you need to discount things for or

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:12,150
whatever that Eventbrite does or Tito

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:14,250
does more generally I feel as though LCA

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,480
in particular to a lesser extent Pike on

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:20,610
a you but certainly LCA has a remit to

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,750
use open source software and contribute

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,450
to the development of open source

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,310
software wherever possible and moving

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,630
over to Eventbrite would probably have

00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,620
been a problematic thing for our

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,330
attendees as well as for the community

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,220
this is less of a concern for Pike on a

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,530
you but I feel that it's nice that we

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,480
can support a python-based stack that

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,640
does this thing and is not and is open

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,640
source it also saves a bunch of money

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,160
are you comfortable thank you for an

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,560
excellent talk

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,170
are you comfortable talking through what

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,910
the problems that the workload that

00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:00,990
you've saved for the conference

00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:05,100
organizers yeah okay so zookeeper has a

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,800
model where once you once you have

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,340
finalized your shopping cart your your

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,400
your registration you as the attendee

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,530
can't make changes to what you have what

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,710
you've ordered so a particular problem

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,630
for this is that certain ticket types

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,120
the professional ticket type at PyCon a

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,180
UNL CA would include a free dinner

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,800
ticket in it and you would need to

00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,870
select the dinner ticket in your

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,040
shopping cart when you went through and

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,870
registered if you forgot to add it then

00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,590
you would need to have staff come back

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:42,720
and add the dinner ticket for you so we

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,360
saw this as a recurring support issue

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,100
for Python au and when I spoke to LCA

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,780
organizers that was a thing that needed

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,580
to be fixed

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,620
God that they needed to deal with year

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,770
upon year and so we came up with a model

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,200
whereby individual users can go back

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,760
into their into their registration and

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,770
add the things that they might have

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,110
missed and give them the free tickets if

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,780
they're entitled to them and basically

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,160
for LCA we sent out a mail out saying

00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,900
these are the things you've ordered

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,480
these are the things you're entitled to

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,600
but do not have you can fix this here

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,520
and we did not get a single email about

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
fixing registration for LCA

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:32,650
this is a little more detailed because I

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:36,410
know a little bit of the stack sure

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,840
have you had when looking into this

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,460
little bit symposium is fairly

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,930
well-maintained upstream when they're

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,500
still definitely having some problems

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:51,340
getting that standardized and reused

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:57,650
correctly yes okay so I noticed this and

00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:00,770
I had a I found a fairly I'm gonna say

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,200
passionate complaint made to me by one

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,050
of the LCA twenty eighteen members when

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,000
they tried to run my test suite for

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:10,580
registration which is that I depended on

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,620
upstream symposia and not the LCA focus

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:18,320
symposium because certain models in it

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:22,730
diverged and it wouldn't run on the LCA

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,910
2017 model on the LCA 2017 fork I'm

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,520
currently working on a fork of symposium

00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,680
that makes it so that you don't actually

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,650
need to fork it in order to get the base

00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:37,700
functionality and so working on figuring

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:42,050
out where you can where it's possible

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:44,390
for like consumer apps to consumer apps

00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:46,550
to extend things that are in base

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,930
symposium and rather than having to fork

00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:51,020
and change the things that are in basis

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,110
imposing on I hope to have that finished

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,690
for North Bay Python because if I could

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,490
like conference this is like actually

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:04,190
conference driven development I you know

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,780
I have a conference to run and I can if

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,670
I have an actual use case for it I'm

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,310
more likely to fix it and I feel as

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:13,130
though the the linux australia fox of

00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,900
symposium would probably go away if i

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,070
needed to if if i were able to finish

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,110
this and i feel like this will be the

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,210
case for most other prominent users of

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,420
symposium we've got someone up the back

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,420
there

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,430
an extension to that question really

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:37,590
yeah why why not put a registration into

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:42,340
symposium and just have it exist there

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:45,820
at the moment that would require at the

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,560
moment that would require the upstream

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,880
developers of symposia on to want to

00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:54,070
have it as part of the package and

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:57,850
currently they don't Django is quite

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,470
good at being modular anyway so at the

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,450
moment the only dependency that

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,750
registration has on symposia on itself

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,880
is the presence of a model for a speaker

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,120
profile so to tell whether or not you're

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,600
entitled to a to tell whether or not

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,130
you're entitled to a speaker ticket if I

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,570
got rid of that dependency and figured

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,810
out how to make that a modular thing

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,340
then there's no need for them to

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:24,460
actually be part of the thing and theirs

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,140
so it makes sense for them to be modular

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,430
and I think that site feels a bit more

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:32,350
like how Django does things anyway like

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,460
we have a distribution of Django apps

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,650
that make it possible to run a

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,710
conference and hear the bits that fit

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,240
together as opposed to here is a giant

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,670
monolith of things that have to work

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,250
together and I think that's a that's you

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,040
know one of the the big things that we

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,960
benefited from I think was being able to

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,360
pull in components and put them together

00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,810
there's no reason to make them

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,740
inextricably linked okay I think we have

00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,880
time for one more question

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,030
yes the question is whether we have one

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,080
more question doesn't seem that doesn't

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,790
seem that way well thank you all for

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,370
coming along I hope you enjoyed the talk

00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:12,310
and yeah if you have any more questions

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:14,710
about what we did or conference tech in

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,480
general I will be around the conference

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,810
so probably working on tomorrow's slides

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,990
after lunch so find me soon thanks for

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,050
coming along

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,050
