thank you Joe so thank you so much Josh

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,119
now that josh has told you hopefully how

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,640
wonderful I am I'm going to completely

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,939
ruin all of your impressions of me by

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,939
doing this

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:42,340
[Music]

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,340
stranges

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,570
as to stack implementations what I'm

00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,570
looking for

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,659
[Applause]

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,379
[Music]

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,599
[Music]

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,280
so thank you so much PyCon i know it's

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,010
hard to believe I've never been formally

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,040
trained in singing that that's just

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,329
natural ability which I had right there

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,400
so today I'm talking about building the

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:44,170
National recasting hotline and because

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
some of you I know will want to be

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,120
calling this during or soon after the

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,220
talk those are the numbers as you can

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
see as we provisioned more lines we got

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,629
better and better at picking numbers for

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,299
it those are the numbers which you can

00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,950
actually dial which are useful to people

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,720
these will also be posted at the end of

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,310
the talk along with our list of the

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,109
github repository so that you can

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,040
immediately deploy your own hotline if

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,970
you want to so 1 what was the root

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
hassle hotline and what is this a

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,400
recasting hotline well it started off as

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,290
a toy it started off with me working out

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,299
how do I use this voice over IP stuff

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,549
and it was essentially my hello world of

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,769
wipe it was like okay I call this number

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,200
it needs to do something the equivalent

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,680
of the hello world is it plays a song or

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,940
it plays a sound file so I set this up

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,609
pretty much for my own testing purposes

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,910
but it now reserves receives more than a

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,980
thousand calls per month so so this is a

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,010
hello world service which has seriously

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,569
got out of hand it is run as a public

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,639
good service so I fund this out of my

00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,560
own pocket it costs a little bit more

00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,930
than two hundred US dollars a year now

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,930
because it's gotten like popular so

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,819
people keep calling it and but it is

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,470
absolutely totally worth it I'd bump

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,019
into people that like oh my goodness you

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,519
made the Rick Astley hotline I use that

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,069
at work I use that in part of my

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,810
security information I use that when

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,790
filling in forms please use this when

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,139
filling in forms it's exactly what it's

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,209
there for

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,209
you'll occasionally find it like

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,820
on the street and at this point you

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,789
might be thinking how is this even a

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,039
talk like why did Pike or even accept

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:27,560
this if it's just a hello world that

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,610
people use the reason it's a talk is

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,770
because I'm going to show you how to

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,289
build an interactive voice over IP

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,389
system from scratch and one of the

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,830
fantastic things about this is that I'm

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,320
not a Python developer I have an

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,479
absolute newb at every piece of

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,520
technology involved in this when I was

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,820
setting this up I had no idea what I was

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,650
doing and that means I've hit all those

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,150
noobish mistakes that you hit when

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,550
you're doing these things so you can

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,630
hopefully learn from those mistakes it's

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,130
really nice when someone's trying

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,940
something for the first time they hit

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,539
the things you might not otherwise

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,479
expect so the rick astley hotline sits

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,220
on top of a platform called Twilio some

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,660
of you may have heard of Twilio they do

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,009
a whole bunch of things now but I got

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,740
into them because they offered voice

00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,930
over IP as a service you can go to their

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,430
website and you can provision phone

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,840
numbers so if you want something which

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,310
kind of looks like an Australian mobile

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,530
number they're a bit expensive they're

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,520
about six dollars a month but if you

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,260
want to get something which is outside

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,389
of Australia like a US number they're

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,430
like a dollar per month or or less in

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,220
some cases so it's very very inexpensive

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,930
to set up one of these numbers and the

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,639
first thing I did when I grabbed one of

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,080
these numbers is it's like okay I want

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,740
to be out of send and receive SMS

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,419
messages this was my original purpose if

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,849
I had a machine that was having problems

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,409
I wanted it to be able to text me um so

00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,630
the way in which you do that hopefully

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,820
we're not afraid of code here pretty

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,400
much you create yourself an SMS send

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,440
object in purl because I'm a pill

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,330
programmer you give us some information

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,180
you say send this and and away you go

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,460
but the API is practically the same in

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,949
Python in JavaScript in Ruby in whatever

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,510
language you might be programming in so

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,010
this is very very straightforward and I

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,490
was using this mostly for alerts and

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,470
other things um it also makes it easy to

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,120
make and receive calls but of course

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,949
that requires a little bit more work

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,539
because I'm like sending an SMS where

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,280
you're asking the server to do something

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,680
the server's got this incoming call that

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,610
needs to figure out how to handle that

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,070
the way in which you do that is if

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,330
you're using the Twilio console it gives

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,470
you a whole bunch of things you can work

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,450
with and it says hey

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,430
voice comes in here is a web hook you

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,350
give it a URL and what it expects to

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,710
come back is this thing called twiddle

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,510
which is a flavor of XML and it looks a

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,800
little bit like this so this is simply

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,770
saying the response when you call this

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,360
number is to play this mp3 now this mp3

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,940
file so it plays a cowbell which is

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,710
pretty cool but eventually it stops so

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,750
you can say well please play the cowbell

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,270
ten times so you can like properly

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,770
dancing everything so version one of the

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,340
Rick Astley hotline was me simply

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,950
changing that URL to a copy of Rick

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,620
Astley's greatest song so that was it

00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,630
that was my basic hello world and this

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,460
was enough for me to do another

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,580
important thing which is make outbound

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,650
calls so one thing that you may have

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,020
noticed if you're if you're Tom in the

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,210
front row here is that if you ever post

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,680
something to social media saying oh hey

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,070
I'm traveling this is my new phone

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,330
number if you need to call me and I see

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,070
that you've posted that in the last half

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,860
an hour so you'll probably still awake I

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:28,430
will run this code so that you can enjoy

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,530
some wonderful Rick Astley what that

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,540
looks like again this is a bit of Perl

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,919
code it's very very straightforward you

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,460
fill in some credentials you have a

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,710
lucky person and then we simply say hey

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,780
I want to call from this number to this

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,580
number and you provide a URL which is

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,640
game is going to provide that snippet of

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,500
twittle which says what it's going to do

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,580
so that was that was version 1 just to

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,410
demonstrate because I want to pepper

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,750
this entire experience with live

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,830
demonstrations just to demonstrate I

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,479
have a program which does that so I've

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,070
got Rick roll and I can put in someone's

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,300
number normally I would do that that

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,160
were being taped I don't want the entire

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,210
world to have your phone number so

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,360
instead I'm going to type Rick knee

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,440
which calls me and oh you've all got my

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,979
phone number now anyway because it will

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,960
be in that response but you can see here

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,000
that I'm now being called by Rick Astley

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,540
who I've got on speed dial and if I were

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,540
to answer that

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,410
[Music]

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,410
[Applause]

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,720
thanks to this thing you've probably

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,750
heard that before so I might keep

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,710
playing it so that was version 1 version

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,710
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,650
oops let me put back to you so that was

00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,630
version 1 it was simply a static piece

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,870
of twirl with a couple of pieces of code

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,640
and it sort of rolled around to April

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,680
first and I realized that this was sort

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,050
of our peak operating time every year

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,300
was April 1st and I'm like wouldn't it

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,560
be great if we could improve this

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,400
wouldn't it be instead of just having

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,730
one song

00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,990
you could have interactive menus so

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,020
rather than just listen to that original

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,730
you can listen to remixes and because

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,100
there are some amazing remixes out there

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,410
of never gonna give you up so being a

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,820
Perl developer I initially developed

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,580
that in pole dancer which is the

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,270
equivalent of flask for anyone in the

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,800
audience who knows Python and there was

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,350
there was one downside at the end of

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,560
this this required me to have a server

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,180
to run that application on and the

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,130
result was everything was running on a

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,650
single server it was a micro ec2

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,910
instance on Amazon it had a whole bunch

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,510
of other things running at the same time

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,550
and occasionally it would go down now

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,680
Tulio is nice it will email you if

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,810
you've been if you've received an error

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,840
if something's gone wrong but by this

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,330
stage it had started to be popular this

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,910
is a a graph of the number of seconds of

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,580
joy delivered per month by the Rick

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,190
Astley hotline and most people the

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,780
average call is about 5 seconds long

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,480
people realize they're being rickrolled

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,600
and they hang up so so to get whatever

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,990
I've got their 70,000 seconds of joy

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,850
being delivered is pretty good over the

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,760
last 30 days we've had more than 1,000

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,350
inbound calls um but the problem is if

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,590
you're running the Rick Astley hotline

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,960
and there is an interruption of service

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:20,270
Twitter lets you know

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,190
damnit Pogue you sick you know never

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,990
gonna give us up yeah you've really let

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,080
us down and this thread keeps on going

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,330
it just it just keeps on going and and

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,550
it wouldn't be isolated anytime we've

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,680
had any service interruption at all just

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,260
Twitter would just rickroll me

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,000
continuously and and just for the record

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,339
I'm sick of being rickrolled please stop

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,880
it please please stop it this is a

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,459
service I I have for other people so

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,830
version 2 version 2 it's like I really

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,200
don't want this to ever go down I really

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,740
don't want to be maintained thank you

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,970
I I really don't want us to go down I

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,610
really don't want to be maintaining

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,470
machines by what this to like be out a

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,120
scale to however many calls come in and

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,770
of course we know that when you want to

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,680
make something scaler but a reliable you

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,760
just add more cloud to it and and so

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,130
that's what I did

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,160
I used a service called Amazon lambda

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,959
AWS lambda and the idea of lambdas is

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,820
that you have code that runs on demand

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
so rather than having here as a

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,750
container or here's a virtual machine

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,640
it's just like oh this is come in will

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,490
spin up this little micro instance just

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,890
for the duration of that um it's service

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,930
I've spoken to the people at Amazon they

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,390
do actually have real machines sort of

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,160
behind the curtain running this but the

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,170
idea is you write an application you

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,150
give it to lambda it runs as needed and

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,910
they claim it has a 40 millisecond

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:43,850
lifecycle so from spin up to tear down

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,980
that takes 40 milliseconds overall and

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,930
you know you're not paying very much for

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,870
that it's very very responsive certainly

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,820
responsive enough for telephone calls

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,620
why did I choose to go with lambda well

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,740
one reason is they give you a million

00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,390
free requests per month so every time

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,160
someone makes a phone call into the

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,220
rucastle hotline or they press a button

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,860
that uses up a request I'm never gonna

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,810
hit a million of those in a month if I

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,600
do I pay I don't even know what that is

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,029
nano sense Piko sense like per request

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,350
thereafter um they also of course charge

00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,000
you on compute time so you don't just

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,880
spin up a Bitcoin miner or something

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,770
they give you for 500,000 gigabyte

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,440
seconds of free compute time per month

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,779
which I figured out if I'm using a half

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,959
gig of ram is about nine point two five

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,680
days of computation time I would need to

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,779
have $6,000

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,390
worth of call costs per month before I

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,300
start paying for the CPU costs so I'm

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,649
essentially bankrupted before this kicks

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,810
in which means it's for me it's

00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,029
essentially free

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,040
um but is it easy is it you see this set

00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,180
up ADA where you're slammed up so I was

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
like oh yeah this sounds like a great

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,450
technology

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,830
let me grab the documentation and is

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:57,450
there a QuickStart guide there is

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,130
starting on page 170 of the AWS lamda

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,760
documentation is the Quick Start Guide

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,589
which is 14 pages long everything before

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,160
that is background reading that you need

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,930
to know in order to QuickStart and and

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,880
if you've ever had a conversation with

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,190
me you know that I have no attention

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,200
span whatsoever there is no way that I

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,330
could possibly do that and it involves

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,430
API gateways and I am services and

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,980
something with s3 and I don't know

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,560
what's going on this here is a picture

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,029
from locum it's which takes pictures of

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,529
you whenever you commit code this was

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,529
not actually on the rickety project this

00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,130
was on the KSP c10 project but it sort

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:37,770
of demonstrates how I felt about this so

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,130
I was very very happy when I discovered

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:43,830
a wonderful project called zapper and

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,630
the zapper is is basically magic like

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,940
all good technology that is sufficiently

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,190
advanced it um what you do is you write

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,890
a flask app a Python programmers in the

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,860
audience might have heard of flask and

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:58,140
zapper does the heavy lifting for you so

00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,400
rather than you having to like deploy it

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,580
out and like figure out how everything

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,230
on lambda works you just say zap oh

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,790
please do this for me so I'm going to

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,430
show you what the fast life flask app

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,020
looks like which I wrote so here it's

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,600
like please give me flask set an

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,880
application name from Twilio give me the

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,100
twin-off stuff that I need I would have

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,200
a I apologize this is a little bit small

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,579
but just an array of all the tunes that

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,339
I wanted to give people so all the

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,709
remixes who their by where they came

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,250
from what the description is and where

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:31,740
you can find the the music files and

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,060
then I simply built a simple menu so

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,410
welcome to the National Cassie hotline

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,350
you may make your selection at any time

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,089
to listen to this by that please press

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,010
this number and then most importantly

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,690
the very bottom to hear these options

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,990
again press 0 if you do not wish to be

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,600
rickrolled please hang up now

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,519
the irony of this is that the menu plays

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,810
after the first song has finished

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,449
playing in full so you have already been

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,009
rickrolled by this point although if you

00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,490
press zero you can skip straight to the

00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:05,069
menu I have a few helper functions in

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,600
there I have a play chain function all

00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:08,970
it does is it says I'm going to be

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,060
producing at will response and this

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,759
gather section gather is how we receive

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,190
key presses so gather says I want to

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,009
receive one key press I want to have a

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,930
ten-second time out after I've done

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,670
everything else so after it's finished

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,459
playing the menu it will wait for 10

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,050
seconds and then it will play whatever

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,449
URL which I've given it there and it

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,430
will say the menu so the idea is to play

00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:34,440
a tune it plays the tune it plays the

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,000
menu afterwards any time during that

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,160
process any time during those gather

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
commands you can press a button and it

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,420
will do what it was whatever responses

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,589
with that button and it just calls your

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,300
application again your flask application

00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,610
again it passes through that new

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,560
selection the response down the bottom

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,420
triggers if we turn out if they don't

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,050
seem to be doing anything we just hang

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:58,560
up on them we say goodbye and then this

00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,569
is pretty much the entire application we

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,759
say that you know get the digits in here

00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:03,810
if there's no selection then we've just

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,930
received the phone call there's no

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,399
digits pressed we just play that if they

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,649
press zero then we know that that's our

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,589
main menu we play the menu and otherwise

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,759
here comes a remix we play that remix

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,079
the actual flask application has a

00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,550
little bit more in there there's some

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
exception handlers in case things go

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,480
wrong there's checking for funny digits

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,689
like star and hash and everything but

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,839
this is more or less the entire code um

00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:30,000
so before I actually run over to zapper

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,290
let's give this a call to demonstrate

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,360
that it works so if I open up my phone

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:42,660
um I have Rick Astley on speed dial

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,899
which is excellent and I'm gonna call up

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,899
now

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,160
[Music]

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,660
welcome to the national recklessly hot

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,510
la you may make your collection at any

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,750
time to listen to it bit by Keitha

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,839
Khyber press one to listen to dubstep by

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,510
crystallize press two to listen to Daft

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,750
Punk press three to listen to of

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,150
achieved by Nils press 4 to listen to

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,640
drum and bass by wave shapers press 5

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,770
bass is really to listen to EDM by riot

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,740
press 6 and so on and so forth what if I

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,759
make a selection

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,759
[Music]

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,259
[Music]

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:56,750
you know the rule and so on looking at

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,059
the core logs it's amazing because I

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,770
will see people who like call up the

00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:04,280
Rick Astley hotline and they will stay

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,230
online for 30 or 40 minutes it's very

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,750
clear they're listening to every remix

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,200
info and then they're replaying some of

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,800
them over a telephone which is the worst

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,929
thing for music so you've got your flask

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,510
application you've done some testing how

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,970
do you actually get it out there so if

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,410
you've installed Sapir so you know pip

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,120
install Zappa set up your virtual

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,770
environment and everything um it gives

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,530
you this huge page of text it's very

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,540
very colorful there is only one real

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,160
question in there which is like have we

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,040
selected the right defaults you can just

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,340
hit enter for yes and you now have as a

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,710
per application to in order to deploy

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,830
that you can see that I've written Zappa

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,059
deploy production and so on this is

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,559
going to push it out to production and

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,270
it's given me an error message there

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,670
it's like hey you don't have the proper

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,740
iron rolls so if you get that which I

00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:58,370
did the way in which you set that up is

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,570
you set up your AWS credentials so you

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,190
need to make sure you have the

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,080
appropriate credentials so that it can

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,820
make rolls that do the right thing and

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,730
so on and so forth so that was the first

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,309
problem which I get not too hard to

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,140
resolve you can then say okay I want to

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,960
try and zap a deployed production again

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,850
and you can then run zapper tale to see

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,860
what's going on and what I got was this

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,330
constant list of things down the bottom

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,760
I apologize the screen is a bit small

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,830
unable to import module handler no

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,530
module named handler and like this is

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,210
weird it's it's working fine locally I

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,309
looked at the zip file it was creating

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,490
the zip file was absolutely fine it

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:39,110
turns out you can embed UNIX permissions

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:41,300
inside zip files and AWS cares about

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,250
that so if you happen to have I don't

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,010
know why if you happen to have a private

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,240
file inside your zip file then AWS

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,059
Lander can't read it

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,640
so chmod the entire directory so that

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,960
everything's readable do that again

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,000
zapper update for

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,130
option and it sort of pushes it all up

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,320
this is entirely automatic and at that

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,630
point it worked it actually honestly

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,010
worked so it was a little bit of

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,720
stumbling through that to try and get

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,090
things working but it was relatively

00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,130
straightforward once you've got it

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,929
running there are some quite cool zapper

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,260
commands which you can execute zappa

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,330
status shows you everything it shows you

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,980
how many versions you've uploaded you

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,720
can roll back to previous versions

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,289
there's a sapper rollback command so you

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,210
can go oops

00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,490
totally mess this up go back to the one

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,830
I had previously ideally you're using

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,169
development and testing environments as

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,240
well so you never hit that but it's the

00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,970
Rick Astley hotline so I haven't been

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,649
that good with my with my my software

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,529
engineering practices there have been

00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:41,270
times where I've had to do row backs

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,669
what's incredibly useful for seeing

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,620
what's going on is Zappa tail Zappa tail

00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,059
connects to the lambda servers and it

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,279
shows you all the requests which are

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,779
being made I've blanked out a few things

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,700
here like people's personal phone

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,140
numbers and everything but there's quite

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,299
a bit of stuff which you can see here

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,270
you get things like where are they

00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,799
calling from so which country which

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,649
state are they calling from which city

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,750
if it knows the city it has all this

00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:07,700
extra information which is provided

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,620
there and people don't often realize

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,630
when they're calling a service that hey

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,130
I've got your phone number now I've got

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,279
this other information now and in fact

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,409
if I if I zip over here you can see that

00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,600
I've got a log here of everything which

00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,919
is going on I've been making a few phone

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,659
calls and you can see down the bottom

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,760
it's like status southeast Australia

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,580
because obviously Victoria's not a state

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,169
southeast Australia is a state but you

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,169
can see all of this stuff which is

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,520
coming in so do consider calling numbers

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:39,799
anonymously if you're not sure what that

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:41,630
number is you go back to him so zapper

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,730
is seriously cool zapper meant that I

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,520
could skip pretty much the entirety of

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,549
knowing how all this cloud stuff works

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,669
and I could just write Python which was

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:54,799
not too hard for me to learn so what

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,080
sort of future plans do I have all of

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,110
this um well one thing which I want to

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,419
do is I'd like to have SMS conversations

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,480
enabled I haven't done this yet because

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,980
it involves keeping state and what I

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,580
would like is something where if you

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,350
give

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,000
your phone number to a person that you

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,370
know you'd rather not have your phone

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,470
number either they're a douchebag or

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,480
they're like a a company that you don't

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,090
like or something I would have just

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,190
respond to any messages it receives with

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,810
Rick Astley lyrics and so you could

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,060
conceivably have something like this you

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,910
know hey good to meet you drinks

00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,380
tomorrow and what I want is it to sort

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,330
of wait a little bit of time to give you

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,320
the illusion of being human and come

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,180
back with we're no strangers to love and

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,520
you know you can imagine all year I'm

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:45,680
definitely stranger and it's like you

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:48,170
know the rules and so do I whoa what

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,140
rules a true commitments what I'm

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,870
looking for

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:56,240
hey babe we just met you wouldn't get

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,150
this from any other guy and and I almost

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,980
guarantee that if the person is how I'm

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,070
imagining in my head that'd be like I

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,840
mean go right so that's one thing which

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,720
I'd like to add this ability for it to

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,850
to respond to text messages and so that

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,510
I can log those test message those those

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,860
text messages for my own amusement

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,910
because I I would love to be able to

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,680
give the next version of this talk and

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,390
say these are real conversations people

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,410
have tried to have with this bot I

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,940
guarantee that will be fascinating I

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,910
also would love to have some sort of a

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,790
karaoke mode Twilio has the way to

00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:33,680
record what a person is saying record

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:36,500
everything on the line whilst something

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,170
else is playing so we could say the anti

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,600
karaoke mode press star and then have

00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,790
the person's sing along with the Rick

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,560
Astley song and if anyone here has been

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,600
to Moana there is an art exhibit there

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,250
which is a whole bunch of people singing

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,900
along to Madonna songs it's absolutely

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,910
fantastic it's intended as an

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,470
interactive exhibit you should go in

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,540
there and sing with everyone on the

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,280
strings um I would love to have the same

00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,480
thing here if I ever want arts funding

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,000
that's the arts funding that I'm gonna

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,650
go for and of course the last thing

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,330
which I want is I've got people's phone

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,890
numbers I know when they're calling I

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,050
know which people are like the frequent

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,180
callers and there are frequent callers

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,280
to the rucastle hotline that call back

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,570
every week if someone hasn't called for

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,450
a couple of months I would like to like

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,520
send them a single text once only which

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,800
says I'm never going to give you up and

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:27,740
and then never ever ever text them again

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,860
so I've shown you here a couple of

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,410
technologies a a w s lambda and Twilio

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,760
obviously commercial platforms but all

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,170
of the code which I'm running on them is

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,970
a hundred percent free and open source

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,100
software zapper is free and open source

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,990
I'll be giving you the the github

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,640
repository for the really hot line in

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,750
the moment there's a readme file there

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,580
it's just essentially QuickStart

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,200
instructions how to set up your own so

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,230
if you want to deploy extra casting

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,760
hotlines you can do so and whilst this

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,040
may have seemed like it was a silly talk

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,929
I hope that the information you've

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,730
learnt can be used for serious work as

00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,830
well if you actually want to set up a

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,990
serious voice over IP hotline or

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,420
something so thank you all very very

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:09,140
much for coming to my talk I hope that I

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:11,770
didn't let you down and make you do good

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:16,150
things with Python thank you

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,150
[Applause]

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:29,919
oh I was off by one slide okay thank you

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:38,559
so any questions I believe we have time

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:44,350
for questions hi Chris um it is now

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:47,460
hello Oh what's on now other than just

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,480
Rick rolling people what public benefits

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,929
applications do you see for the Rick

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,700
Astley hotline what public benefits so

00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:56,919
the thing I use it for most often is

00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,260
when I have a any sort of a form that

00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,669
insists I enter a number there are lots

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,010
and lots and lots of web forms out there

00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,440
which is like you must have a number in

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,389
order to continue but they only use that

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,889
number to bother you and so this is

00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:11,200
perfect that's the main thing which I

00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,669
use it for you could also use it if

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,110
anyone's like in any case where someone

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:16,419
is pressuring pressuring you for a

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,350
number for whatever reasons and you want

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:19,269
to give them something which looks like

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,190
a believable number but which is not

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:23,590
your number that seems to be the main

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,529
thing but there is of course all of the

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,669
humorous aspects as well I had a friend

00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:30,460
of mine who works for a marketing

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,250
company who managed to get a memo on

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,679
everyone's desk in the sales department

00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,740
saying we have this hot lead on a new

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,399
client and his name his name is Rick and

00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,470
and we trust you we trust you to make

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,240
this sale like we're counting on you

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,669
this is your chance to make it big and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,500
and it was just fabulous I saw the

00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,779
things spike off the charts from this

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,480
one company for one day which was great

00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,940
another question from the front yes hey

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,490
Paul um so like you said you've got a

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,080
couple people who who genuinely use the

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,789
service and listen for a significant

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,710
amount of time and you've got some

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,090
demographic information of who of where

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,370
they are from and you've got their phone

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,450
number have you have you thought about

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,950
trying to get them the help they need

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,659
sorry have I thought about getting them

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,480
to getting them the help they need

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:23,470
getting getting so put an extra option

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:26,169
in there if you need help press star a I

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,940
have not no no but if you want to talk

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,490
to me afterwards about how to best

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,530
arrange that

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,760
oh sorry so the question was do I have

00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,100
any insights as to what people are using

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,380
it for obviously using it for jokes is a

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,470
big thing I think that some people just

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,640
like listening to the music and and so

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,870
they will call up and they'll listen to

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,090
all the music and I've been on road

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,740
trips where suppose like oh we can call

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,380
Rick Astley and listen to Rick Astley

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,760
remixes on the road trip that person may

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,990
have been mean but that was that was

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,360
very good but I think people genuinely

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,360
enjoy listening to the music sometimes I

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:14,010
hypo um in order to get your auto

00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,540
texting so you're texting bot up and

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,840
running for them for giving out of fake

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,400
numbers do you is there a way that you

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,679
can make it a mobile mobile because I

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,110
notice that these are not known others

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,330
okay so the question was oh we've got a

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,700
microphone so is there a way that I can

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,550
make it a mobile number so I have a

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,100
small rant here I would love more than

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,290
anything else to have void mobile

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,240
numbers in Australia because then when I

00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,309
go traveling overseas people can still

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,500
text my mobile number they can still

00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,540
call my mobile number and it can rap to

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,780
whatever I want that would be amazing at

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:51,929
the moment as far as I'm aware we don't

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,760
have that a few months ago we didn't

00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:55,980
have it at all you would have seen that

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,600
I had a slide in there showing oh four

00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,730
numbers in Australia they were only

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,820
capable of text messages they were not

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,320
capable of voice messages so that is

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,880
something which I would love as far as I

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,860
understand that is and I could be wrong

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,309
here but my understanding is that is a

00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,230
legislative sort of situation and I

00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,210
would imagine that the existing telcos

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,559
really don't want that because that

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,350
would lose a whole bunch of market share

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,370
so that's a bit of a problem Australia

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,290
elsewhere in the world

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,420
us numbers absolutely totally fine it's

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,740
really really easy but yeah Australia

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,179
unfortunately we don't quite have that

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,480
yet and I think it's legislation more

00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:33,980
than anything else any other questions

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,980
Katie Tim

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:45,330
well done there you go so was this the

00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,220
first time you've used by thumb to

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:53,130
achieve something this was my first time

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:55,440
for a gramming in Python I thank you I

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,940
wanted I wanted to rickroll people so

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,110
much I learned Python to do so yes but

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,100
I've since used this knowledge for other

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:07,620
things which has been good any more

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,900
questions I don't know how we're doing

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:14,820
the time we have plenty of time

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:17,190
oh we do you Paul a serious question you

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,770
know who rings the service has

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,660
recursively rung it not that I'm aware

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,970
of but I don't know Rick Astley's

00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,550
personal phone number so I can't tell I

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,920
can tell people in London a calling but

00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:32,100
I unless I call them up and say hey who

00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,090
are you which which i think is a

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,040
terrible idea

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,630
but that Betts version 3 yeah I think

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,620
Giulio does have a function where you

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,600
can do caller name lookup so and Sam may

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,040
correct me here or not but I know that

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,020
there's a tikki box I can take to say do

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,360
call a name lookup to try and find out

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,680
if it knows the person's name I've

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,510
intentionally left that off I don't

00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,780
really want to know more about people

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:59,730
than I have to have you considered

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,000
making another phone line with Adele's

00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,000
hello

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:14,530
I think you've just discovered my next

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,780
project there is so there is a there was

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,059
two days of hackathon on Monday and

00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:24,480
Tuesday if you want to set up the Adil

00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:27,100
national Adel hotline we can do that I

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,360
suspect I'm just volunteering to add

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:35,110
another feature for you but it's a one

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:39,070
idea I'm assuming you can in the code

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,740
decide which sample you play based on

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:45,309
the information from the call so if

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,020
they're in if they're in the u.s. then

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:48,039
you play a different version but I'm

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,909
also wondering

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:53,950
you'd have to store a state but you

00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:56,409
could then say okay well this person has

00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,419
called and they keep on asking for the

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,760
dubstep version so I will play the

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,400
dubstep version as a first option I'll

00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,640
send a pet request please do please do

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,409
that's that's that's on the topic of

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,090
knowing where they're calling from we

00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,500
can absolutely do like localization

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,990
based upon that as well so it'll be like

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,400
Oh based upon the country like rather

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,530
than like welcome to the rucastles a lot

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,480
it's like did i mate you're at the Rick

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,620
Astley hotline like we could do that not

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,110
based upon the number they're calling

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,150
but where they're calling from I think

00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,850
we have some more I think that all the

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:31,179
time we have the next session starts at

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,440
a 450 cool Oh grab me during the break

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:38,130
and I'm happy to answer more questions

00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,130
