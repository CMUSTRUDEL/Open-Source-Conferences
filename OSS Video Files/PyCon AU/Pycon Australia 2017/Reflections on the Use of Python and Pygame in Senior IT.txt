okay I hope everybody had a good morning

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,370
tea thanks for coming back for the

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,650
second session today I'd like us to

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome Jim Lloyd from clay field

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,599
College in Brisbane where he's the

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,230
coordinator of learning innovation at a

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,050
passionate teacher of IT and mathematics

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,910
and so he's here today to speak to us

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,609
about the use of Python and pygame and

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,609
seniority thank you thank you very much

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,489
on that note I'm out now thank you very

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,290
much for having me yes as Nick says I'm

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,390
from Brisbane we have winter in Brisbane

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,489
- it's not exactly the same as Melbourne

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,600
winter but that's fine it's a little bit

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,670
of banter to lighten the mood

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,120
yes thank you very much for having me

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,190
basically I'm from yeah a peel college

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,289
as it says on the screen we are pre

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,840
prepped to year 12 College so we have

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,320
co-ed to year 6 and then from year 7 to

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,579
12 all girls so pretty much around

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,829
Brisbane we're known as a girls school

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,430
but we do have co-ed gs6 I teach

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,110
primarily 77 to 12 sometimes pick up a

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,110
year 6 robotics class or something like

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,479
that but most of my work is in senior so

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,100
just wanted to talk today a little bit

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,369
just about my own personal reflections

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,650
on using pygame for our senior IT class

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:24,299
and just my run down is going to be I'll

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,369
talk a little bit about how we do things

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,500
in Queensland not a million miles away

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,540
from other states but just to give you a

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,579
bit of context as to how we do it the

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,250
makeup of our subject areas and how I've

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,390
approached the assessment tasks and I'm

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,299
going to show you some samples that the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,979
girls actually made and talk a little

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,240
bit about how I assess them as well so

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,500
you may or may not be aware Queensland

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,310
senior assessment is changing we had

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,460
what's called the opie system which is

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,479
very distinct from HSC for tertiary

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,619
entrance but at the moment we currently

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,799
have our two main senior ot subjects so

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,020
we have IP T ni TS now IP t is more your

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,709
sort of guts processing databases

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,840
systems that kind of stuff and I ts is a

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,209
bit broader in its scope so

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,890
in some ways that's good but in some

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,270
ways it's difficult to define

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,530
particularly as we're moving to external

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,740
assessment it's going to be a bit tricky

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,780
to actually manipulate so to that end

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,780
both those subjects are sort of merging

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,790
into something called digital solutions

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,730
which the first release will be next

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,800
month hoping to be fully implemented by

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,150
2019 but we'll see what our beloved

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,020
Queensland government decide to do with

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,760
that deadlines so really we're in an

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,989
interesting time in Queensland in senior

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,220
IT we're sort of in a bit of flux

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,780
because we want to prepare for digital

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,310
solutions but we want to maintain some

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,720
of that good stuff that we've got in

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,959
ideas particularly in the girls school

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,120
we want to maintain some of the design

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,800
multimedia aspects while still getting

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,110
the guts of the good coding happening as

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,709
well so it's an interesting time in

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,230
short so the subject that I teach in

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,230
senior IT 11 and 12 is IPS information

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,080
tech systems the way we set up is 11

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,940
it's formative year 12 is summative and

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,730
as I mentioned it's quite broad in its

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,989
scope so a lot of schools implemented in

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,370
different ways so some skills will

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,820
actually focus pretty much on networks

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,620
nothing else but networks whereas you

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,959
can go through UX web programming you

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,160
can see up there as well so what we do

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,410
at clay field is we try and find a

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,660
really nice balance lots of web stuff

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,690
but also an element of the design

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,910
process as well and programming sort of

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,489
threaded through all of that and I think

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,650
it works the main assessment sites we

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,060
have in the IES syllabus are as you can

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,910
see on the screen supervised written is

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,450
basically means that exam extended

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:51,030
responses generally written sorry not a

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,500
written a maybe a multi-modal or a video

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,109
research report they've done something

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,940
like that the main - we'll look at today

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,850
well I'll tell you about as a practical

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,739
exercise and the I'll touch on the

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,329
supervised written as well but the big

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,299
beast kind of things they do are called

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,620
projects but the smaller scale ones are

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,590
practical exercises and that's what I've

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,630
done with PI again so the projects are

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,370
typically what we do are sort of

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,380
websites or web presences so we're doing

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,849
responsive websites app versions of the

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:24,530
site and practical exercises what we

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,530
call learning objects or games typically

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,520
so practical exercises are generally

00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,229
smaller scale projects but they don't

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,150
require an evaluation component so it

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,740
kind of did the design development and

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,060
then they stopped which is a little bit

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,509
odd but in previously is we've used

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:46,099
learning objects as a focus so that it

00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:48,960
basically gives the students are good

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:51,990
parameters in which to work now

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,879
previously for the last four years or so

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,930
we've used flash and ActionScript 3 I

00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,560
don't know if anyone's too familiar with

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,360
flash and Esther script 3 and it has

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,150
some very good points it has some very

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,370
not so good points so yeah historically

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,860
anecdotally probably more fidgety more

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,479
unforgiving more errors prone to a lot

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,889
of problems and a very steep learning

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,439
curve so if the girls are coming into

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:19,259
year 11 to do I TS and they haven't done

00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,229
in year 10 or 9 a selective subjects

00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:25,289
they're kind of going to find that

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,509
learning curves much steeper and even

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,729
for me so many years before I came to

00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:32,370
clay field I've done ActionScript 2 but

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,990
then execute 3 was different different

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,240
enough that it was quite a learning

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,719
curve for me also and so it got me

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,849
thinking also flash is sort of being you

00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:43,649
know ship the out ship not ship that's

00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,689
not the right word phased out is a bit

00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:49,649
weird so many of my colleagues are

00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:50,879
switching to html5 as a way to sort of

00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,689
get around that but still maintain that

00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,719
interactivity

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,689
we use html5 and jQuery for mobile app

00:05:54,719 --> 00:06:03,020
development which is our application of

00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:06,240
that but I because I'm a big child I

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,729
like games and I like getting the kids

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,770
to actually design and create games

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:13,259
because I think using that situation

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,339
that context provides a really rich

00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,810
context for the kids to actually

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:22,860
implement the dde cycle design develop

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,689
evaluate and a lot of good comes from it

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,830
plus when I'm marking I get to play

00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:30,779
games so that's pretty good it goes

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,039
without well I need to mention my very

00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,689
understanding supportive head of

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,279
department who basically gives me enough

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,019
slack that I can say hey I want to do

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,849
this crazy thing with my game can I can

00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,210
I please yeah as long as it matches the

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,800
criteria

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,639
that's fine off you go don't bother me

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,289
all right so that has been extremely

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,060
beneficial hmm and I hope he's watching

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,410
alright so I basically went to my HUD

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,970
and said can I do PI again please

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,259
instead of flash anyway yeah okay go on

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,699
so the task was I gave the girls the

00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,039
following tasks to design develop a

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,870
prototype arcade style game with an

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,349
educational purpose now I chose those

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,789
words very carefully prototype because

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,500
that puts equality constraint on what

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,940
they need to do in a short space of time

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,630
so they're not flipping out trying to

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,340
make the next triple a title arcade

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,349
style so it's kind of simple in its

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,570
functionality and for an educational

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,330
purpose now for me the giving them that

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,979
purpose is crucial because it gives them

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,169
an audience and a clear goal as to what

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,250
they're actually going to create so

00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,449
rather than just making a game who is

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,830
this for and then they've got to worry

00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,750
about all should I make for adults for

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,039
kids for teenagers whoever there if it's

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,740
an educational purpose then that gives

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,060
them fixed parameters I give them a list

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,220
of minimum inclusion so it's going to

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,389
have this sort of code element and it's

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,470
got to be done in this formatting and

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,090
you've got to have a while loop you've

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,060
got to have an if loop you gotta have

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,550
whatever and a time constraint obviously

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,349
so the practical exercise is generally

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,240
about three weeks three or four weeks

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,860
whereas a project can extend out to

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,659
about six or seven weeks so to that end

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,669
this was the approach hmm so the first

00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,259
thing the girls did was identify their

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,210
target audience and research the basic

00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,460
designs so their target audience they'd

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,280
pick an educational topic and they would

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,889
run with it so some of them you know it

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,990
would be might be healthy eating or

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:20,130
whatever it might be and then they'd use

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,509
that as their basis we start off with

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,590
the procedural coding so just sort of

00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:26,219
stepping through it doing it the hard

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,110
way doing it the long way as it's kind

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:31,199
of a bit more intuitive and then slowly

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,570
moving into object-oriented sort of

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,640
approach ever so slowly because again

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,140
it's only three weeks and obviously the

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,820
PI games set up I don't know if anyone

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,800
here's used PI game but trying to

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,540
install it on bi ot can be fun yeah

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,940
being sarcastic obviously it introduces

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,510
time constraints but we got there we got

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,560
there eventually

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,700
so if you

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,110
going to use this I would say allow a

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,470
bit of time before you start to actually

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,810
get it all set up there was a set

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,250
creation so I'd said in the description

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,200
that it was a prototype so they could

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,690
just use basic shapes just use the draw

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,160
rect functions in PI game to just make

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,600
little squares of knock into each other

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,670
but they know they wanted to actually

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,350
add their own graphics and chuck them in

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,370
so that was sort of a bit of an

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,240
extension but they all did it because

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,670
they're all kind of compete a bit

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,010
compete against each other ongoing

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,290
testing very important in the way we

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,029
approach and obviously just trying to

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,500
teach some good coding practice as they

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,470
go along

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,450
so commenting code taking care of the

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,300
whitespace and factoring refactoring

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,610
code that kind of stuff as we go along

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,850
so some of the resources that we used

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,020
include the PI game website one of the

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,820
most ugly websites that I've seen in my

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,650
life but has plenty of good reference

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,730
material there so if they're trying to

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,380
find something how do I draw that

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,060
rectangle again it's all there it's

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,320
pretty descriptive so it was very

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,420
helpful it was helpful for me as well

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,990
because I had to skill up a bit to get

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,710
ahead of them

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,790
just to know what we were doing this

00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,750
website resource is really good invent

00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,950
with Python I don't know if you guys

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,160
have seen that there's a bunch of free

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,220
ebooks PDF and they're really good

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,390
they're really great I use them for

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,520
younger grades as well it was sort of

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,160
just dabbling in pipe and not nothing

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,190
formally assessed but near 89 and of

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,230
stuff they can make just basic in the

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,670
idle just basic games and little

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,010
generators and things which is really

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,250
cool so let's invent with Python I think

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,530
it's common at all with it yeah but

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:30,060
check it out this guy is on YouTube his

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,230
YouTube address is sent Dex which you

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,900
can see on the right-hand side of the

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,790
screen here but he's got a bunch of

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,740
lessons under a different channel just

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,350
to confuse you the new Boston so if you

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,850
look for pygame under the new Boston

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,070
he's done a whole course of making a

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,860
little race car game which is really

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,150
cool and the way he does things are

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,560
slightly different to the way I would do

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,850
things but that's also good to show the

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,190
girls that there's a lot of students

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,020
that there's more than one approach to

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,310
achieving a task in Python and in PI

00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,510
again which i think is really cool and

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,150
then you say well what's the benefits

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,490
this way over this way and then learning

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,160
happens and that's why we're here at

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,570
clay field we have the office 365 suite

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,800
which is really helpful

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,470
so I've got the video channel on there

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,350
and I make my own flip videos because

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,530
I'm into flipped learning and what we do

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,910
is a division of flipping which is

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,140
called in flip so basically the girls

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,450
would come into class and they can watch

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,240
that video in class the way our

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,630
timetable is set up that's doable

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,010
because we have hour and 15 long lessons

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,200
and the software I use for that is

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,320
screencast-o-matic which is a beautiful

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,290
name I love that and yeah just upload

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,290
that to the 365 video channel they can

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,430
get it through the 365 online so they

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,580
can do it at home they can do it on the

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,720
B IOT device independent doesn't matter

00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,590
but you could use YouTube or something

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,350
similar okay now I'm gonna show you the

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,190
results these are a little video of the

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,240
of the games that the girls came up with

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,470
it's not going to play in full-screen

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,660
mode so I'm gonna have to be really

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,750
unprofessional and drop out into this is

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,060
that gonna work are you gonna play this

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,850
was by Georgia and she has a hamster

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,780
called Oreo so she made a game for it

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,780
and that's not gonna work sorry I'll

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,600
just quickly show you quickly showing

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,260
this one it plays in this mode but not

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,930
the other one it's really helpful so

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,280
basic left/right control I suppose Space

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,380
Invaders kind of style you've got things

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,530
randomly generating within a range along

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,750
the top it's what's called bleating in

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,270
PI game which is actually just updating

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,510
printing that graphic to the screen

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,730
every update loop this one by Steph and

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:43,830
that's go bananas very similar plays a

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:45,510
little bit smoother yeah not too much to

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,970
it but as I say very simple very simple

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,220
kind of scope

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,380
yeah and it's a maze game as well by

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,230
Molly but I've pointed a cheat you'll be

00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,260
able to see in a second here we go yes

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,700
and then that presents another challenge

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,230
like how do you prevent cheating or how

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,050
do you code your own cheating in so that

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,550
you can skip through your levels which I

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,930
think in the early days of video game

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,550
programming that's why the word cheat so

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,860
the developers could just jump to level

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:15,580
10 and test it I could be wrong

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,320
and yeah so there we go I'm courageous

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,490
little black square going in on my merry

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,540
way yeah okay so that's a maze game then

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,200
there was this one which was sort of

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,660
mouse controlled as well yeah little bit

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,150
incomplete that one but we've got the

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,510
idea so it's kind of she was

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,100
experimenting with getting yeah just

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,990
giving mouse control which was unique

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,460
for the group and then this one was

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,810
really cute this was a little like a

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,520
skill tester almost so you're the

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,310
penguin up and down arrows you've got to

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,810
get the fish but avoid the jellyfish and

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,900
then when the hook actually collides

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:53,170
with the sprites yeah you get points and

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:57,970
points off and that was that was quite a

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:01,900
fun little one to help develop cool

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,060
alright little game over screen so the

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,140
general idea was I won't play that one

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,880
that's just scrolling through the

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,810
general code where you can see what they

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,550
did well and what they did not so nicely

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,780
but the general idea was they had three

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,360
game states so they had a menu screen

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,680
gamescreen game over screen and working

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,970
on those three basic parameters they

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,310
were able to sort of jump between the

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,190
three if they wanted to create an extra

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,720
level or some kind of bonus stage they

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,040
could so there's a little capacity for

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,430
extension but again it was only three

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,560
weeks

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,690
so trying to compact this all down

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,670
fairly neatly so let me just jump back

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:40,180
into preview mode am i going for time by

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:42,220
the way okay ten cool all right I think

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,770
I'll need that little bit cool alright

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,770
so assessing these people these people

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,390
my students practical exercises overall

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,050
were very functional because they were

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,040
coding this all from the ground up I was

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,300
quite impressed with what they came up

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,670
with and they worked really hard on it

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,290
as well and there were plenty of issues

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,670
it was a learning curve for all of us I

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,740
keep saying learning curve sorry about

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,490
that

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,510
so there were things that they were

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,550
trying to do that I wasn't quite sure

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,110
how to do so I'd go back to my resources

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,190
if I could figure it out and if I

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,710
couldn't figure it out we'd find some

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,480
kind of calm

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,800
was because again they were keen to

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,270
impress and do their best which

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,890
sometimes meant that they were sort of

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,290
reaching beyond their capabilities

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,810
within the constraints coding was

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,160
generally sound I would I'll talk a

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,190
little bit about my own reflections on

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,320
it later but general it was pretty good

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,930
documentation was a bit to be honest as

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,880
is the way with a lot of Technology

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,400
subjects in my experience the kids want

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,990
to just jump in make it okay why did I

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,900
get to see what's going on this works

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,900
where's your documentation oh I don't

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,090
know I've better design it after I make

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,510
it is generally the way they work I love

00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,980
the way their brains work it was very

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,740
difficult to sort of find the spread

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,560
between them because the quality across

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,880
the board was pretty similar I'm not

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,070
gonna say I was fantastic but it was it

00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,900
was good but there wasn't too much to

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,500
separate them so what did I do

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,950
I gave them an exam and they loved me

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,650
for that

00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:10,100
so the supervisors written is just the

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,960
written exam in 11 and 12 and this was

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,880
done on the computer under direct

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,530
supervision so it was exam style so a

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,990
series of multiple choice ones just on

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,930
Python generally and then some PI games

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,510
specific questions as well with a few

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:29,030
open-ended kind of questions just to

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:31,460
balance it out and they still they still

00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,320
forgave me that's my class at their

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,680
formal there's only five of them by the

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,910
way very nice small class so we still

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,390
get along pretty well even though I gave

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,310
them a big dirty exam so general

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,520
reflections on using PI again well the

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,410
pros of it was Python 3 I just love it

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,850
I really just love it it just feels good

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,050
that's how I explain it to other people

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,460
and say why not JavaScript why not

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:57,230
Python it's this pie that just feels

00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,700
good to actually make and write it there

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,290
is no shortage of resources and

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,090
tutorials so for educational purposes

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,800
that's great if you can get the kids to

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,690
actually take the initiative to go oh I

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,260
want to do this how do I find out rather

00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,450
than going to actually go YouTube find

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,120
that cindex guy I find the web resources

00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:17,060
there's just heaps of stuff

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,520
cross-platform for B yit oh well it's

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,770
the best because all the girls want

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,000
globally shiny Macs and all our stuff is

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,400
Windows that's

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,430
kind of fun but yeah it's just perfect

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,190
for that as well and it's free it's

00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,620
always good Khan's installing pygame was

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,000
a pain in the butt I won't lie but we

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,730
got there in the end so it's not that

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,530
big a deal because you I'd look online

00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,670
and find how do you solve PI game and

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,570
there'd be four different ways of doing

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,200
it and only one of them worked so yes

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,530
that was fun

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,810
time was a bit of a constraint it did

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,370
mean from a coding point of view that I

00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,700
wasn't able to give them enough

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,440
instruction on functions or classes you

00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,990
know as as they would need to sort of

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,250
know professionally but it was okay for

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,830
a little sort of introduction I think

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,790
what would I do in future I would

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,170
consider the piper will work very well

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,380
as language of choice and digital

00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,170
solutions currently we probably get a

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,640
favored JavaScript a bit more over

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,320
Python but it's really between those two

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,990
there's no reason why we can't do a bit

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,470
of both in my opinion but in the first

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:27,050
instance I think JavaScript will work

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,340
pretty well but I'm gonna try and plug

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,630
as much Python in as I can yes so

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,040
looking at cross-platform options again

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,990
JavaScript will work pretty well but I

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,400
just don't like pipe and feels nice like

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,410
it as I say yep so four PI games

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,450
specifically I just I wish if I had more

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,730
time maybe extending it back to like a

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,830
year ten doing a bit of Python getting

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,780
it set up their exposure to

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,340
object-oriented using classes accessors

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,960
and mutators

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,010
and really exploring the full range of

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,180
PI game elements because there's some

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,710
other stuff that we didn't get time to

00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,390
touch on we sort of got the graphics in

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,670
we got the collisions happening scores

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:05,780
timers but there's a range of other

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:07,430
stuff that we could do okay well that's

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,810
it from me everybody thank you so much

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,180
for listening if you would like to

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,160
follow me on twitter that's my twitter

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,840
that's all my education um as well so

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,030
happy to connect with teachers from

00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,610
everywhere that's my dog as well on the

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:23,570
Left that's a hairy one on the right

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:24,010
hand side so thank you thank you very

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,519
much

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:31,799
[Applause]

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:35,340
okay thank you Jim so we have about ten

00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:43,409
minutes for questions now so Reggie and

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:45,599
I'll bring a mic D thank you and thank

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:48,090
you Jim for sharing all of that just for

00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,409
the regards to the project and that you

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,899
mentioned with your assessment just

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:53,249
wondering what you use as a basis for

00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,070
that and whether or not you extended

00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:58,590
with Python or pygame further in that or

00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,970
perhaps something else and just also

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,809
very quickly I was interested when you

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:07,559
said about four digital solutions and

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:10,080
the use of JavaScript and/or the Python

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,940
for that it seemed like you obviously

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,489
passionate about Python and just

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,409
wondering how come JavaScript is perhaps

00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:18,119
getting a little pushed in in that

00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,859
respect so those two questions please

00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,239
okay well I'll start the second one

00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,739
first thank you very much by the way

00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,190
that wasn't expecting question so a bit

00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:26,220
off gun

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:28,139
the JavaScript is pretty much me and my

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,789
head of department I'm kind of more

00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:34,229
Python he's more JavaScript and he's the

00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:36,239
boss so short short answer but that said

00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:38,609
he's not like know Python ever it's more

00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:40,109
just you know JavaScript in his in his

00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:42,869
professional opinion is a little bit

00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:46,889
more applicable in those sort of younger

00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:49,499
grades I would debate that a little bit

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:51,269
but yeah with regard to the projects

00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:54,239
they're generally pretty standard html5

00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:56,909
CSS a little bit of JavaScript web

00:20:54,239 --> 00:21:00,090
presence things with some capacity for

00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:04,349
Python but with the sort of skill levels

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:06,179
of our cohorts introducing a fourth kind

00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,759
of language on top of HTML CSS and

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,429
JavaScript could be problematic but

00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,840
there is some room there I believe for

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,119
that but I need to research that myself

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,210
a bit more yeah so the moment is it's

00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:24,529
pretty pretty stock standard stuff just

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,529
html5 CSS JavaScript yeah thank you

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,620
thank you mentioned that a lot of people

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:36,200
migrated from flash to html5 so why did

00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:40,010
you go with pygame instead how do you

00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,220
compare the html5 game frameworks with

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,780
PI game that's a good question I haven't

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,490
actually used a lot of the html5

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,740
frameworks myself just a little bit I've

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,720
only dabbled but I was keen because I

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,980
had that personal interest in in Python

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,350
to actually just see if we could achieve

00:21:51,980 --> 00:22:00,380
the same things with PI game earlier on

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,520
but yeah beyond that I think yeah a

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,140
little bit hard to answer it's this kind

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,640
of a personal preference I guess yeah

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,409
just sort of moving into the Python PI

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,150
guy I'm seeing if we could do it and I

00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,429
think we kind of can but I need a little

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,370
bit more time to sort of build up my

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,100
chops in that regard but I I know that

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,929
yeah we could do we could do the same

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,929
kind of things in html5 pretty easily

00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:23,470
but I kind of like Python so again

00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:23,470
personal preference

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,060
hello yes you mentioned that they were

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,400
actually on to subject areas at the

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,470
moment which I are going to either

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,260
amalgamate or collide or something yes

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:46,380
soon so what sorts of programming do

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,410
they do in the other topic and and in

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,710
particular where is robotics in this ok

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,290
in the digital solutions now when in

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,780
what's taught at your school ok we

00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,120
typically do robotics in years seven and

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,910
eight that's explicitly robotics so

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,950
that's Lego NXT doing robot C at the

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,950
moment as well with tier sevens and your

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:13,980
eights we are moving into the digital

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:15,060
solutions syllabus is has a fairly heavy

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,380
component at the last time I checked

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,640
it's gone through a few revisions but it

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,100
does have machine learning in there and

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,750
it has got Arduino IOT all these kinds

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,630
of things which has a bit of space for

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:30,080
robotics but in IT s it's not

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:33,000
specifically or not explicitly included

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,560
so I suppose in in IPT which was the

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,420
other subject you might find that

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,850
because they have to as part of the IPT

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,130
syllabus they have to learn a language

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:44,100
which has been you know in previously as

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:48,450
visual basic it's been C C sharp it's

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:50,310
been yeah something so it's yeah we try

00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,080
and yeah we're trying to find this

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,230
balance of feeding a little bit of that

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,670
in but keeping keeping attracting girls

00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,710
to the subject through the design and

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,390
multimedia aspects as well so try to

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,270
find that nice healthy balance but yeah

00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:08,070
in a few years it will all be gone so

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:11,520
see how we go what's this space I also

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:18,900
had issues installing play game max one

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:21,930
of the one of the issues was the IDE

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,860
that comes with Python idle is terrible

00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:27,780
particularly on Mac what did you use as

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,750
the sort of coding environment for the

00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,990
students to develop in idle I use I

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,700
don't know

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,990
from memory they yeah I think that's

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,650
that's all they use I don't think any of

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,840
them

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,940
anything else I don't think what could

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,500
be wrong oh yeah mostly the idle

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,880
pre-installing did you end up using

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,910
homebrew we use the wheel okay I think

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,810
we use memory some of them did

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,070
and some of them did some of the other

00:24:51,810 --> 00:25:02,430
methods but we all got there in the end

00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:03,360
okay yeah we got time or oh it's

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,970
everywhere okay

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,140
one more quick one last question one

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,520
more my legs are getting tired what

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,180
contact have you had with with other

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,980
secretaries in schools programs teaching

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,620
the either Python or just more free

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,390
software generally like JavaScript oh

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,730
well I have I'm not sure of what

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,470
Victoria does that does but in senior

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,090
assessment we have a moderation which is

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,160
called in year 11 it's monitoring in

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,980
year 12 school verification and each

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,420
district has a panel of teachers and I'm

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,460
on one of those panels so I get to see

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,630
other skills work programs and get to

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,850
see their assessment and sometimes

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,350
borrow them I mean no I'll just look at

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,200
them and I get inspired by them I don't

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,640
steal them at all no so yeah it's like I

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,110
said at the start lots of schools are

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,990
doing different applications of the

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,390
subject they're doing different

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:54,660
languages as well a number of them are

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:55,830
doing Python yeah it's kind of it's a

00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,450
little bit all over the place to be

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,060
honest but in a good way

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,500
one schools even bringing an SQL into

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,460
RTS which is kind of unheard off because

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,560
SQL is normally reserved for IPT so yeah

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,240
but it's it's a fun time because it's we

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,230
know the subjects on the way up so we're

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,230
going to kind of just do what we want

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,450
so yeah it's great getting that feedback

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,830
from those other teachers in that panel

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,070
situation as well because it's a good

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:23,420
little panel yeah so we actually do have

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:29,190
time for a couple more questions okay

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:31,590
clocks are hard I'm just trying to get a

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,060
couple of like fine details so those

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,650
projects were took you three weeks

00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,990
how much prior knowledge did the girls

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,520
have come into that roughly how many

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,080
hours per week did you have to spend on

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,520
it and did you provide any kind of

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,140
structure in the program what did they

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,170
write everything literally from from

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,430
nothing okay so the few elements that

00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,250
Chris I'll try and answer as best as I

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,299
can with this with regards to Python

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,190
that only

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,200
a little bit of mucking around with it

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,149
as sort of filler at the end of the time

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,549
not feel of proper learning right spite

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,629
them but after that all that assessment

00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:02,190
that happened I just went okay guys

00:27:00,629 --> 00:27:05,249
let's play around the Python to make you

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,539
know a little I stole the idea off Tim

00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,980
Stevens who spoke here a few years ago

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,360
just make a little wizard generator from

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,489
Harry Potter so you basically write a

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,869
few lists pick your house pick your

00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:15,059
animal pick your wand and then just

00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:16,529
randomly generate a wizard bang pretty

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,720
cool so just a few little mockery and

00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:20,519
things like that so this was the first

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,899
task they did this year which meant

00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,869
they'd had Christmas to forget

00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:28,049
everything I never taught them so any

00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:30,119
prior knowledge was kind of just with

00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:35,249
Python was pretty much at the base level

00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,690
absolutely nothing I the structure I

00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,330
gave them the scaffolding I gave them

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,609
rather was I would show them let me just

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,759
scroll back here I'll just see if I can

00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:46,710
bring up that shot of the code so

00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,059
setting up like your constants for

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,549
example just the convention code of

00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,440
making that Capitals the RGB importing

00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,480
your modules that is a video but it's

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,889
not playing setting up your variables

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,029
all this kind of things so it set up the

00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:03,419
the core factors that they needed just

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,759
the basics of you know movement keyboard

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:09,539
movement and collisions and that was it

00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:13,169
that's all I gave and as I said so use

00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:14,549
the office 365 videos as well so they

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,529
could patch into those and each one of

00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:17,399
these just says like drawing shapes so

00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,100
how to actually just draw a basic

00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,720
rectangle or circle and that's pretty

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,249
much it I said okay you design your game

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,929
have a look at some different arcade

00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:26,909
styles and go with that so that's why we

00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,799
had some that was sort of drop dropping

00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,470
things from the ceiling others were just

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,129
a maze game yeah so they kind of were

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:42,899
able to bring in their own creativity

00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:44,519
from that basic scaffolding yeah how

00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:50,039
much time sorry

00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:52,789
so it's in class time they were safe I

00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:57,539
think what was it five hours of cycle so

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:59,100
yeah so five lessons per fortnight so

00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:02,220
they did a little bit of pre-work as

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,620
well so in class time five lessons a

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,330
fortnight so

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,380
and then yeah they they'd work on it at

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,390
home as well because they were just so

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,880
keen to sort of it's only a small class

00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,350
so they're all trying to in a friendly

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,500
way try to get the edge on the other

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,820
ones so yeah it wasn't a lot of time but

00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,779
I think they did for the time that they

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:25,400
had I think they did fairly well you

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,559
said that they got Mack down if they

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,299
hadn't done design or showed you design

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,529
did you teach them any tool for

00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:32,690
designing oh no sorry that's just a

00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,520
general comment on technology just in

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,350
general it wasn't strictly speaking

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,870
these guys I said the documentation was

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,039
kind of it was okay but I just mean in

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,080
general when I'm teaching you a

00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,700
technology for example and I'll say okay

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,299
make a game in scratch or game maker or

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,010
whatever it might be

00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:49,820
they'll make it I think okay where's

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:51,710
your design document okay no but no I

00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,240
definitely say guys you have to complete

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,950
this design section even to the point

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,899
that we're including that as a draft so

00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,360
that has to be due two weeks before the

00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:01,070
actual project is done because it's

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,149
quite can be quite an issue not always

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:07,490
it's not always maybe I'm exaggerating

00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:10,100
but okay that is time so thank you again

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,870
Jim thank you and we'll be back here in

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,950
10 minutes

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:16,910
uniform

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,910
