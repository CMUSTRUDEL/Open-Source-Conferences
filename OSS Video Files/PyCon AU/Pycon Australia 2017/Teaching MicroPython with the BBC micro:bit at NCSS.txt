probably time to get started welcome

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,059
back carp you enjoyed lunch um it is my

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,880
great pleasure to introduce Jim and

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,969
Nicky Jim Russ red is a software

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,789
engineer at rock learning and has also

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,769
been volunteering to teach at the N CSS

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,050
summer camp for how many years five

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,900
years Nicky has been doing the same

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,980
thing at volunteering teaching at N CSS

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,529
for longer than that

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,149
she's also dr. Nikki England has PhD in

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,370
computer science and works at the

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,530
Australian computing Academy and they're

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,170
going to tell us about teaching kids to

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,180
program with Python with micro bits

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:48,239
thank you very much thank you very much

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,149
Katie so to start off with we don't

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,100
respond to heckling via tweets and slack

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,410
responses so this is this is how to get

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,489
in contact with us later but first let's

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,780
talk about this summer school so the

00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,430
national computer science summer school

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,559
is run out of the University of Sydney

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,329
we get about 100 kids from across

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,400
Australia New Zealand we'd bring them in

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,610
for a residential camp it's super

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,560
intensive we have a few of our progeny

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,420
in the front here and the back and it's

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,820
the most amazing experience for these

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,840
kids we split them into streams and

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,670
we're going to talk about the the

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,890
different streams later but there's a

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,299
lot of Python involved and the other

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,130
really awesome thing about the summer

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,740
school is that it's for teachers to

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,520
shout out to my teachers in the back and

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,470
front so if there are any teachers here

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,890
I've heard that there are you can come

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,689
along and learn Python and computer

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,280
science and super exciting things for 10

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,720
days of your summer holidays because if

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,750
you're the sort of people that PyCon you

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,770
you want to come along to that as well

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,530
the other thing that the national

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,259
community ient school does is the NGSS

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,810
challenge it's running at the moment and

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,470
we're currently teaching 10,000 kids and

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,020
Counting

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,939
python so if some of the tutors look a

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,380
little bit distracted it's not

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,270
necessarily just because we're boring

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,729
but what we want to talk about now is

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,099
teaching electronics at the summer

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,869
school specifically okay so the summer

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,060
school divides the students 120 students

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,340
into two streams one stream does Python

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,160
web development there

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,660
Stream does embedded for the first

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,580
several years that's been hard we know

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,920
and for the first time this year it was

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,150
my crabbit our goal here is to take

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,769
students who've never done any

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,950
electronics before or any sort of

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,750
embedded system stuff and cover as much

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,209
as we can it's in a fairly intensive ten

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,940
days we do lectures and labs we cover

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:39,230
everything from analog a little bit of

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,200
data processing circuit design at the

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,160
end we teach them how a CPU works

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,860
robotics where these amazing little

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,510
micro bit robots and it's a it's a

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,510
fairly intense course but a lot of fun

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,579
Electronics is really hard it's not gold

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,930
hardware for nothing and teaching

00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,730
students who've never done any of this

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,459
before and they're lacking any context

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,540
in this is an incredible challenge at

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,930
the summer school we're incredibly lucky

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,120
that for every student every three

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,180
students has them one has one tutor so

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,680
we're not short of support but we still

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,260
have a lot of problems from wires

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,790
falling out - kits breaking - circuits

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,500
that don't work software that doesn't

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,049
work debugging everything at the same

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,269
time is a huge challenge for us and our

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,160
goal here is to make this approachable

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,180
and exciting for students and we don't

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,459
want them to walk away with an

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,769
experience where their this electronics

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,870
thing was interesting but just seemed

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,639
really frustrating and hard and we'll

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,079
get stuck all the time and we don't want

00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:44,750
to create that experience for them this

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,000
is a photo from a few years ago right

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,130
before the project was due to go things

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,709
are not working and we're on the field

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:55,160
in this case we'll see more details with

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,750
us in a second but with electronics

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,340
you're stuck with your ability to debug

00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,480
it we had I think a few multimeters with

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,980
us and stuff like that

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,290
it looks like somebody's pretty much

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,150
disassembled this entire circuit but a

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,530
lot of a lot of time is spent in this

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,190
sort of situation like oh what's going

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,750
wrong where do I even begin yep it's

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,790
really hard and our students are novices

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,870
some of our tutors are novices - a big

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,340
part of the summer school is that it's

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:22,419
also a great teaching environment for

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,419
the cheaters this is a

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,590
again debugging exciting but this is

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,360
sort of moments before frustration again

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,830
and we don't hold back

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:42,270
due to analog converters capacitors

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,770
transistors digital logic we really

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,410
really do run through a lot of content

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,610
and and we'd love to find every possible

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,530
way to make this easier same student

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,330
from before a bit more frustrated at

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,979
this point

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,550
so we want to tell you a bit of a

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:02,639
cautionary tale if you'll bear with us

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,949
with story time with Nicky a few years

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,360
ago we ran the embedded system so that

00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,070
all the photos you've previously seen

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,510
weren't using the micro bit they were

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:16,320
using Arduino which is a let's say a bit

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,360
more challenging to learn with so let's

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,169
go back and revisit that field trip we

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,080
had the project our was exciting and

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:28,950
optimistic and all of the things that

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,930
you want in a project engaging but

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:35,580
they're really a little I mean that's a

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,440
half-hearted thumbs up at best and if we

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,940
zoom out a little bit more you realize

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,479
that this is because they're trying to

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,160
debug their project while it is

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
literally meters away from the plane

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,050
that it's supposed to go up in and it

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,050
doesn't work and there's not a lot you

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,330
can do about that at that point I mean

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,130
we ended up recording this that the data

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,760
that we were hoping to record on an iPad

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:01,199
instead we really want kids to feel like

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,840
a sense of accomplishment and get a

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,940
working project and then iterate on it

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,710
as well and having a project that works

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,389
but then a wire falls out at the last

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,710
minute and the whole project falls down

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:16,500
is really frustrating in the greenshell

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,960
closest to the plane know is about to

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,900
get a PhD in quantum computing so great

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,780
great tutor support yes good good tutor

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,760
support so so this was the project in

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,180
2013 we were trying to get a weather

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,380
balloon up and track it using Arduino

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,419
there were a few things that went right

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,350
that look of oh my god look at what we

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,700
achieved this is

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:43,380
fantastic I did a thing also countered

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,620
by Jim's lack of sleep in the middle

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,680
there that's what we were really looking

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,420
for but but there are a few stumbling

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,940
blocks along the way including issues

00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,820
with Radio Licensing launching a weather

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,730
balloon requiring additional permits an

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,860
extreme fire risk danger driving into an

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,140
area with a busload of children where

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,350
the plan to pop the weather balloon was

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,880
to overheat a resistor look it was

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:14,310
tricky and then there was a thunderstorm

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,350
to back it all up it was it was a

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,030
challenge if you'll notice there there's

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:23,250
actually a child hiding under the truck

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,890
but despite everything that went wrong

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,210
and plenty of things went wrong the

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,040
students had the most amazing time they

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,540
they loved every minute especially the

00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,010
bits that went wrong in fact but we're

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,810
trying to get that excitement and

00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,220
engagement that you can do with computer

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,290
science and electronics and embedded

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,650
systems and maybe reduce a few of the

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,810
things that went wrong so the upside of

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,400
Arduino is that it's it's great for

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,050
hackers it's great enough people who are

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,520
already confident in programming a

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:56,520
little bit at least but it's a bit

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,930
harder for learners so I have ever

00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,610
mentioned software and hardware at the

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,620
same time is hard students would come to

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,210
us with it's not working and we wouldn't

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,500
know whether or not to tutor them as a

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,870
software problem or to do them as a

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,310
hardware problem and that 15 minutes

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,700
while we figure that out is just

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,930
frustration for the student a single

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,400
what I falling out can be completely

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,430
catastrophic all these two hours on a

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,990
project and Arduino is harder than a day

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,460
at sea plus plus and people don't kind

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,260
of give you that face when you say C++

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,850
for a reason and Bluetooth is really

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,140
hard as well one of the things we always

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,790
wanted to do with the project is have

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,530
them communicate with each other and our

00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:37,710
experience with Bluetooth and Arduino

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:41,070
was nothing but hustle so the micro bit

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,010
the micro bit is a amazing project run

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,420
by a bunch of different organizations

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,090
the BBC the Python Software Foundation

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,120
tech will save us just to name a few of

00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:55,170
many and the project involved giving

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,150
a device a single micro bit computer to

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,110
every grade 7 student in the UK so I

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,100
make a million of these were made and

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,220
now they're available in Australia as

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,110
well and they are very powerful little

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,020
device about four times as powerful as a

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,120
typical Arduino they run an armed

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,380
microprocessor so the same family of

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,470
processes that are in your mobile phone

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,750
but more importantly they have a lot of

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,460
very important onboard functionality if

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,470
you are teaching electronics and

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,279
programming it's hard to beat them they

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,630
are a truly amazing device they are

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,150
robust you can throw them you can drop

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,470
them the auto electronics' is very low

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,980
profile it's very hard to knock anything

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,270
off

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,640
they look nice they don't look

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:43,680
intimidating and there's a bit of nature

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,230
run they run Python we'll talk about how

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,940
to get one later they're not very

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,050
expensive compared to our Dino as well

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,380
and they run Python which is why we're

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,480
all here

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,370
so specifically they run micro Python

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,570
and and in the internet things mini car

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,580
there's a lot of discussion about micro

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,620
Python today but it's basically Python

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,390
re-implemented for microcontrollers it

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,450
has all of the functionality of regular

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,920
Python modular some of the libraries are

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,870
missing but laters there's micro

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,279
versions of a lot of those libraries but

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,640
all the great things you like about

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,529
Python string processing using numbers

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,380
without worrying what type they are all

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,940
just works and for the 99% of things you

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,440
want to do on a microcontroller you

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,150
don't care that it's a hundred percent

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,920
efficient write written in C and

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,230
assembly you just want to read a button

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,670
and set an LED or pass some string data

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,450
from a sensor or something like that

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,400
in particular when things go wrong on an

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,920
embedded device you've got to figure out

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,529
why and on a c++ bit of code on a

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,779
microcontroller it just doesn't work on

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,339
Python you get a stack trace it tells

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,400
you which line it tells you what you did

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,350
wrong almost and the repple that the

00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,700
interactive prompt on python you can run

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,770
on the device while connected to all of

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,910
your electronics and you can see well

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,800
what happens if i change the state of

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,140
this pin what if i read from this pin

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,880
what if i read from this sensor so for

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,440
students to iterate and experiment

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,410
towards understanding what's going on

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,759
they can do it so much quicker and

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,870
with so much better reinforcement of the

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,480
things that they're learning as they're

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:15,209
going on board so I've got a list here

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,120
through the photo unlike an Arduino that

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:20,009
has a processor and an LED the Micra bit

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,569
has 25 LEDs on the front you can make

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,930
little pictures with it it has a compass

00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:30,149
and accelerometer two buttons and a

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,230
radio and a temper sensor as well not a

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,529
very good temperature answer but

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,300
nonetheless compare this code from

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,490
Arduino on the right to Python on the

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,399
left to read whether a button is pressed

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,329
and to toggle an LED I'm sure people

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,439
have done a lot of I doing you can

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,180
probably find ways to make this

00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,470
marginally better but look at all the

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,089
little things you have to remember and

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,579
know about got to know about pull-up

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,980
mode on it on a button input I've got to

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,660
remember to set the LED to output I

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,129
can't just see if the button was pressed

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,060
I have to check if it's currently

00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,829
pressed and whether it's had a

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,180
transition on the micro break we don't

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,189
have to teach any of this until much

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,620
later we can get them going immediately

00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:06,620
and writing things that are useful and

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:12,420
it has radio my favorite thing over from

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:15,920
Sesame Street is the the Martians and

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,920
discovering the radio radio

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,480
radio is really important and Nicki's no

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,980
talking to talking about why this is

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,930
especially important first reason

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,960
trailing school kids but it's also easy

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,040
so we've had a little bit before in some

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
of the talks about the new digital

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,330
technologies curriculum that's been

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,690
rolled out in across Australia asterisk

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,210
needs hot girls to come so one of the

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,700
parts of the curriculum explicitly

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,560
requires teaching networking now if any

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,900
of you know any sysadmin zatt schools

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,700
you know that they are reluctant at best

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,380
to let students just go nuts on the

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,820
school network so we need to figure out

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,580
a way of teaching networking and

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,550
security and how data is transmitted and

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,339
processed without using the school

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,750
network and some teachers who are more

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,640
confident in networking can set up their

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,040
own mini networks but actually a really

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,410
good alternative is to use the radios on

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,779
these to set up a wireless network

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,720
amongst the students so you can get

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,240
students to develop and iterate their

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,670
own protocols for transmitting data

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,820
between micro bits and letting them

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,860
experiment and come up with their own

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,630
their own protocols makes them it far

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,209
more tangible far more achievable and

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,040
some of fun as well so this is a really

00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:34,510
this is my favorite way of teaching the

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,910
networking part of the curriculum so one

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,589
of the really good benefits of teaching

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,920
micrometres and CSS is that we're now

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,000
teaching Python across both streams

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,480
embedded and that the Python stream is

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,300
unsurprisingly also in Python we used

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,240
the croc learning platform and the micro

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,430
bit notes in that which let the tutors

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
really engage with students as they had

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,459
questions

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,260
it was far more self-paced and it was

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,020
basically a revolution that students

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,850
could focus on their code and

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,860
understanding the computer science

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,150
components what programming is a lot of

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,490
them had never done any programming

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,370
before before we then introduced

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,620
electronics concepts and and absolutely

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,810
getting something working on this the

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,790
hello world for a microbe it is really

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,180
quite simple and that feeling of

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,920
accomplishment led to really high levels

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,410
of confidence in the students with which

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,209
then let us achieve even more it's

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,270
really powerful to have that easy win

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:34,060
going in and continued success

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,130
and the projects that we ended up with

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,340
at the end of this the summer school

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,690
were really fantastic I don't do other

00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,640
projects there's something quite amazing

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,170
about having got the software stuff out

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,510
of the way and a student coming to and

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,730
saying I would like to add this thing

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,860
tell me what the electronics I can do to

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,270
add this to my project whereas before it

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,800
was like oh no more electronics because

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,340
that's just gonna be harder and more

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,260
software so the projects is a roughly

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,580
hell themed project this is after they

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,780
at the end of the ten days and we asked

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,310
the students to break up into small

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,380
groups and come up with some sort of

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,910
exercise that uses the micro bits and

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,880
other other things that we give them as

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,670
well to make a game that involves some

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,530
sort of health-related activity a common

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,670
interpretation of this is competitive

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,380
push-ups or something like that

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,790
two teams seeing you can do the most

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,000
pushups and the micro bits record them

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,070
and score them and we pretty much that's

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,050
as far as we go with the explanation and

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,000
we let the students be creative a big

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,710
part of this is that there's a huge non

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,480
software non electronics component as

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,640
well you'll see in a minute in the

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,620
photos there's effectively what I like

00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,630
to call like craft almost like it's it's

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,300
their build cool things as well you know

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,850
scissors and card pod comes out loads

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,140
and loads of masking tape we also give

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,040
them these line following robots there's

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,470
actually slightly different one than

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,640
you'll see in the photos but they can

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,010
they came up with interesting ways to

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,000
use the physical motion of the robots to

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:56,620
tie into their activities as well a big

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,300
part of these projects was encouraging

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,840
the students to ask questions about what

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,430
they were doing so we add a new sensor

00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,560
and they want to figure out how to use

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,630
it and we don't say here's how here's

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,310
the code you use to do this here's a

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,720
library we say well what do you think

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,310
this sensor does what is the thing

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,810
actually trying to measure how will do

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,150
we deal with things like that how do we

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,800
detect how do we thresher all the sensor

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,150
value how do we detect a change and that

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,920
sensor value

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,150
you can't just compare the last value

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,530
because it might just be noisy or

00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,760
something like that and so getting the

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,230
students to think through what they were

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,030
trying to achieve and then the much

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,430
simpler way of expressing those ideas in

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,050
Python really encouraged us to fountain

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,339
to build foundations on how these things

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:38,260
worked and we added more Pi board I'm

00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,630
sorry a micro Python so the PI board is

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,300
is is the is the official Python board

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,590
micro pathing board the ESPN HD c 6 ads

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,120
Wi-Fi so

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,490
couple of students also experimented

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,490
with adding literally internet-of-things

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,430
to their projects by making their health

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,350
games talked to a website or scoreboard

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,940
or something like that the pi board can

00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,830
show up like a USB keyboard so we had

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,850
games where the effectively the things

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,040
that they were doing in the physical

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,080
world were sending key presses to a

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,530
computer controlling a real game on the

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,570
computer and we use the radio a lot a

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,920
big part of a sense of health thing is

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,390
you doing senses and you want lots of

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,700
things measuring different things all

00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,160
talking to each other and merging that

00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,600
data together and with the radio we just

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,800
we didn't ever think about wiring all

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,620
over their bodies and stuff like that

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,330
that would be really annoying the bikers

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,510
or just talk to each other and and that

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,100
made everything so much easier so we

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,790
want to show you a few of the projects

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,070
that students actually built there's a

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,390
youtube link as well if you want to see

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,100
the projects in action so some of the

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,370
that each group of students each small

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,740
group had to produce a video explaining

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,650
their project as well it's well worth

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,820
looking into so the first one that we

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,060
want to talk about is dance dance

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,640
revelution we had not one but three

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,110
different implementations of dance dance

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,190
revolution and they were fantastic they

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,830
were all implemented slightly

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,100
differently some used flex sensors and

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,390
little boxes there's a lot of creativity

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,610
that goes into the design of these

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,980
projects even if it's just replicating a

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:14,560
game that they know in real life I

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:18,100
particularly liked human flappy bird so

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,780
in this project a student has a micro

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,640
bit strapped to them and there's another

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,110
one on the wall over there that you can

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,490
that you can't really see here's another

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,550
action shot

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,820
so flappy bird shows you the pipes that

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,560
you need to jump over and duck under and

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,950
it's a it's competitive of course

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,340
because that's what flappy bird should

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:43,990
be there was an arm-wrestling Robo race

00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:47,910
so the micro bit that is between the

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:52,000
shooters hands in this case good robust

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:57,980
micro bit the accelerometer was used to

00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,049
control the the the robot at the front

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,090
and whether the robot went forward or

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:06,590
backwards was determined by who was

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,559
winning the the arm-wrestle there's a

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:13,309
ski free micro bit style in which a

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,980
student is holding micro bits and has to

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:18,440
do a sort of lung laughs skiing

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:21,200
constantly it's pretty exhausting as it

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,570
turns out and the the neopixel strip

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,850
lets them know how far they're going and

00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,720
how far they need to continue to go to

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:31,789
win the skiing race there were as Jim

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,000
said all manner of push-ups and sit-ups

00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:37,610
that were done in the name of science

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,220
and electronics it's quite impressive to

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:44,929
see these students how how cruel they

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,539
are within shooters at the end of the

00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:52,880
week but the crowd favorite I have to

00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,450
say was a project called dab-dab

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,710
revolution Nicky what's it Deb ah for

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,350
those of you who don't know any

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:06,399
teenagers a DAB is something a little

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:09,710
like this this is also an acceptable tab

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:11,899
and here you start to see where dab dab

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,580
revolution comes into it but it would be

00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:16,429
boring for me and Jim to just do some

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,710
dabs so instead we've got a little demo

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:21,350
of dab dab revolution that we'd like to

00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,539
do for you so this is a much simpler

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,429
version but basically it's gonna be hide

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:26,779
if I can't see that but what I have is

00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,730
strapped to me you run it by maybe when

00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:32,419
I have for my crab it's strapped to my

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:35,000
arms and these market bits are detecting

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,169
the motion of my arms so the students

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,659
version was much more complicated had

00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,370
flex sensors in the elbows and it

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:43,600
connected it connected up to a screen

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,600
with a scoreboard and stuff like that

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,010
well why doesn't speakers working

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,960
they're supposed to be sound coming out

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,250
that of you guys do you know why

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm think you're not fast enough for a

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:07,100
gym yes so so this was actually hooked

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,360
up to this is just the next five minutes

00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,120
so if you want to leave yeah you do some

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,940
sit-ups - I wanna do sit-ups so there's

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,520
a lot of room for creativity in the

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,200
scope of these projects and and also

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,190
Fitness apparently as well

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,780
coordination is left to the user but

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,130
there's additional ways that we would

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,450
recommend in accessorizing your

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,810
microphone if you want to do these sorts

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,670
of projects or other projects so the the

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,830
bit bot the robot body these are

00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,280
fantastic they're so cute come and play

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,110
with it in the break or in our fidelity

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,550
the neopixels that we saw in ski free

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,590
are super bright and shiny they're

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,720
actually attached to this body as well

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,490
there's a few get some breadboards for

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,980
when you dive deeper into the electronic

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,890
side the my power backpacks that are

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,970
used that are strapped to gyms one

00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,860
they're just screwed in there's a

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,110
speaker which in this case didn't quite

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,780
work get some flex sensors and other

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,520
sensors are all sorts of things and of

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,290
course the best part the best accessory

00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,680
to micro bits is more micro bit so that

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:10,500
you can use radio more powerfully

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,690
there's so much fun you can do so

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,160
basically in general backrub it was a

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,870
massive winner at national computer

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,150
science school because it improves

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,820
student confidence and that led to

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,710
better student outcomes the fact that we

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,090
could do teach Python first and focus on

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,280
a learning computer science concepts and

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,080
then add in electronics when the student

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,090
was ready for it and as the student was

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,580
ready for it was a fantastic improvement

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,620
and we just loved the micro bit radio

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,330
they're really it's it's such a

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,280
fantastic way of getting networking

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,190
going getting projects that can be

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,730
easily extendable and the final thing is

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,380
these micro bits are just so damn cute

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,680
as soon as a student gets a smiley face

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,660
on one of these they're hooked they have

00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,550
a lot of buy-in and they suddenly want

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:59,550
to make more things more exciting photos

00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:02,220
so this is NGSS we think the micro bit

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,880
will work really well in in classrooms

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,460
in fact I know

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,320
it does it certainly works well the

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,390
science school we have a bunch of thanks

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,940
especially to wise tech global for

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,930
donating a bunch of the micro bit so

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,310
that all the students could take them

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:21,600
home that was really fantastic and some

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:24,000
additional links and read about it so

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,100
you get your own the a microbrew is

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,060
distributed by Final and in Australia

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,550
that's element14 so they do bulk sort of

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,020
hundred quantity orders but in smaller

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,640
quantities little bird core electronics

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,980
and Tronics labs are all fantastic for

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,540
all sorts of electronic stuff and they

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,730
have the the microts and and some

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,560
accessories as well and then for tonics

00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,920
and another coming called kitronik they

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,340
do additional kits this is the photonics

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,740
bit bot kit and it's wonderful highly

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:59,070
recommend oh that was the sound of my

00:23:52,740 --> 00:24:09,150
finally did it dad oh and yeah this is

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:10,440
what fun us questions if there are no

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,170
questions we might ask for another

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,630
dimmer but are there questions I'm sure

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:20,640
there are yes

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:23,910
do you have examples or lesson plan

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:29,040
about to use Wi-Fi so you connect them

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:31,980
to teach network for the curriculum so

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,380
specifically not not Wi-Fi but radio we

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,620
don't have lesson plans on how to cover

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,410
that yet but that's actually something

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,870
that with my Australian Computing

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,840
Academy hat on we'll be looking to do in

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:49,050
the near future

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,000
fingers crossed soon if you're

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,880
interested in that um shoot me an email

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,250
or tweet at me so that I can make sure

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,440
that you get a copy and when grogg has a

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,860
course that includes some radio parts

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,130
for the micro bit so the grok learning

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:09,540
resources that were used in CSS that

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,140
course also covers using radio and a

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,140
bunch of other stuff

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,020
did you get a chance to document all

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,270
those also projects so that the rest of

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:29,140
us can go and grab code snippets and use

00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,900
them as inspiration for our students we

00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,690
actually has a blog and it's an upcoming

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,040
post on the blog we were an existing

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,330
post it's a bit of this is content but

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,430
we are planning to go through the

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,200
projects and write a bit more about them

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,420
and what went wrong what didn't yes

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,510
really well better than that we got the

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,580
students to document that's true their

00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:52,450
own projects so they're all up on github

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:54,400
and if you shoot me a link I can show

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,740
you where they are YouTube videos yeah

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:04,210
the YouTube videos are the best place to

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:06,570
start with a bit of polish any more

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,570
questions

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,509
with the micro bet you can buy a micro

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,789
bet you can buy a micro bet that comes

00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:20,990
with triple-a battery pack you can buy a

00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:24,889
micro bet that then has an extension of

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:30,179
my crabbit backpack with the cr2032

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:32,460
which do you recommend for classrooms so

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,259
one of the easiest kids to buy is a

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,990
micro bit with the battery pack that

00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,549
nikki is showing and a USB cable so i

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,620
would say that was the minimum kit to

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,450
buy as a micro bit these little

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,039
backpacks are pretty good in that in

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,590
that they're very small and so these

00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,590
days add a little 2032 coin cell battery

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,509
they the problems when the battery runs

00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,570
out there a bit of a fiddle to change

00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:59,369
and things like that I don't have and

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,950
the battery doesn't last very long I

00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:03,419
think it depends on the project but the

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,490
other thing is that these ones we can

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:07,350
replace with a jst and English AC

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,259
connectors or lipo batteries as well but

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,519
the market doesn't have a charge circuit

00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:15,029
for a classroom I would recommend

00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,249
getting mostly just the basic these

00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:18,960
batteries and a couple of the backpacks

00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:20,940
so that for students who want to do

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,009
something with music or with the speaker

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,830
and get it playing yeah but you can do

00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:28,740
it not sure why then they can use those

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:34,490
ones or they can even radio to those

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:39,690
ones to use it was that another question

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:42,600
wait just wait for the mic I believe

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:46,080
that some an entire state has banned

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,440
cr2032 is in schools because kids can

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,909
quite badly hurt themselves especially

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,899
if they indiscriminate with what they

00:27:50,909 --> 00:28:00,840
swallow so I'm wondering if you can use

00:27:54,899 --> 00:28:02,970
the sound without the 2013 so there's a

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,470
bunch of accessories you can get one of

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,629
that one of the great examples is

00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,220
alligator clips so part of the Micra bit

00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:10,289
is is these these pins down the bottom

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,340
are designed to fit alligator clips so

00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,200
you can very quickly connect them to

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,549
things and there's one of sandwiches a

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
pair of alligator clips the goes to a

00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,029
headphone jack and there's another one

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,250
I've seen it has an amplifier and a

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,909
speaker in it as well I definitely would

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:36,299
recommend that

00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:39,149
that's the way to do it questions I was

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:41,580
just curious that about the BBC UK

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:44,249
experiences what I think you said it but

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,869
what age were the kids like all the kids

00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:47,159
got one of the devices how how old

00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,259
without in quite catch that

00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:55,200
so that was every student in year 7 in

00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:58,349
the UK so 12 13 ish the one of the big

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,470
challenges with the UK rollout was that

00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:03,899
they they sent the micro bits out to the

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:05,429
classrooms but the microbus were

00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:08,299
actually supposed to go to the students

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:11,519
directly some of the teachers weren't

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:14,489
necessarily confident in actually using

00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,039
these devices in in the classroom so a

00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:20,729
lot of them unfortunately are still in a

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,049
cupboard somewhere and an interesting

00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,789
follow-up as well they were targeted at

00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:25,470
grade 7 students and they're certainly

00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:26,820
applicable to grade 7 students an

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,710
amazing thing about the micro bid is

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,450
that they actually scale off I've heard

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,940
about universities Ted Coe she's picking

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,229
up the mic repeat as a first-year unit

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,029
for my own personal electronics projects

00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:37,950
often the first thing I grab if I need

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:39,899
to test something or do a little

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,369
computer side of an electronics project

00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,419
often the market bit is the first thing

00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:44,399
I grab it's the easiest thing I've got

00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:45,869
to use so if I just need a serial

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,249
console or something like that yeah and

00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,720
they could they certainly work well in

00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:49,979
primary school as well in prime school

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,590
environments you can program them with

00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:54,599
block based interfaces as well there are

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,009
several different block based interfaces

00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,389
to choose from yeah thank you for that

00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:58,739
because that was sort of dovetailing

00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:00,239
into my second question which was just

00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:01,590
like what other ages have they been

00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,849
trialed with but it also I was

00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,409
interested to know like what was the you

00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:05,789
command maybe I'll come chat with you

00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,229
guys afterwards but like I was really

00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:10,379
interested to know like what was the

00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:12,090
goal it's a big big deal it's ended out

00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:13,999
to every kid in the country but like

00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,289
what was the goal from the UK government

00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:17,489
what were they looking to achieving them

00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:20,759
what was the follow up and how did all

00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:23,129
of that play out I think I could talk

00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,989
about that for several hours I think the

00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:27,239
main goal was to really boost computer

00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:29,129
science in the classroom they have a new

00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:32,169
curriculum that was released a couple of

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:33,609
years ago and there are a lot of

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:35,309
if company led initiatives to help

00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:38,309
support the teaching of that curriculum

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:41,379
this is somewhat related to that to

00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:45,879
bring back the glory days of the BBC

00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:48,070
micro and and really get the the UK

00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:52,359
population excited about their computer

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:56,230
science legacy history and future it's

00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:59,190
been relatively successful and certainly

00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:03,070
we're keen to learn from their

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,409
experiences okay that's all the time for

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:15,340
questions that we have let's thank Nicky

00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:17,799
and Jim again and here is a gift by the

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,519
way if you have questions about NCS s in

00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:26,669
general you can ask any of these people

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,669
will be around Pike on the next few days

00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,049
