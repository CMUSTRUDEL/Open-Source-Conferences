hello hello hello you I'd like to

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,780
introduce introduce introduce Danielle a

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,050
pro cheetah Danielle is going to talk

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,070
about fighting the controls madness and

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,869
tragedy for programmers Daniele is a

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,480
django core developer he works at Divi

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,619
oh and lives in Cardiff which is in

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,620
Wales that's very far away and helps run

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,140
things like PI diff and Python Python

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,850
Namibia which is very far from Wales as

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:54,120
well and PyCon UK please give it up for

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:56,039
Daniele thank you very much and also as

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,340
well as thank you for being here thank

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,859
you to the organizers not only for

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,559
inviting me before putting on this event

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,090
I know how much effort it takes to put

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,869
on a conference like this and it's run

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,180
by volunteers so thank you to all of

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,920
them and when you see them mix sure you

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,860
say thank you to them because they're

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,710
all putting in a great deal of time and

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:25,200
energy into making this conference

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,840
happen so thank you I should introduce

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,860
myself and that's what I look like on

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,720
television I should also point out that

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,590
you know if anyone wants to discuss

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:48,020
anything that I am in fact Python

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:52,740
software so I work for DVO a Swiss

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,439
software company and we do cloud hosting

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,119
for Python and Django application

00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,600
developers who don't want to be develops

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,610
or system administrators and it's not

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,170
the place for a sales pitch but if you

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,149
make mistake of talking to me afterwards

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,160
you might get one so if you if you're

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,899
interested in deployment and development

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,400
tools and docker and so on come and talk

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,879
to me I'll be happy to talk to you about

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,830
about that and I'm heavily involved with

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,950
Django as I'm a django core developer

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,010
I'm a board member in fact I'm the as I

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,690
discovered some time afterwards I'm

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,700
actually the vice president of the

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,650
Django Software Foundation which is not

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,239
actually as glamorous as I'd like it

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,540
sound that they were and another thing

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,640
that I'm very heavily involved in is

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,090
Python in Africa so I've been involved

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,480
in PyCon Namibia since its first edition

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,760
in 2015 then in 2016

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,500
pike on Zimbabwe came out of that and

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,780
then there'll be a Pike on Nigeria for

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,370
the first time this yes that's one of

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,280
the things that it's an enormous

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,409
pleasure for me to be a privilege to be

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,330
involved with and I'm very lucky that my

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,780
employer gives me very generous

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,760
generously a great deal of time to spend

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,370
on these initiatives and on my work in

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:17,220
the Django project so thank you to them

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,540
you can email me and contact me on I

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,810
don't say anything interesting on

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,040
Twitter but or just come and talk to me

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,500
sadly that's enough about me I have to

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,620
get on with other things and I want to

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,000
talk to you about tragedy and madness

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,010
because it's something that we as

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,409
programmers have to deal with an awful

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,659
lot so you should know this picture and

00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:43,680
this is a landscape with the fall of

00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,790
Icarus and there's Icarus falling into

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,030
the sea in the corner of the frame

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:53,180
unnoticed by everyone else and while the

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,519
world goes on and you can imagine Icarus

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,569
the story falling out of the sky and

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,459
it's a story of fear and helplessness

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,769
was his father's watching him as he as

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,010
he falls and you think well this is a

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:11,239
terrible tragedy and that's that's

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,900
partly wrong actually because a tragedy

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,840
if you consider the original meaning of

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,329
the term was a Greek dramatic form a

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,229
story a narrative and narratives are

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,669
never censor so we say about say this

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,699
might be a senseless tragedy but it's

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,729
not senseless a tragedy tragedy really

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:34,520
isn't senseless it's always meaningful

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:40,430
because it's a story that tries to make

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,699
sense out of some terrible loss and so

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:47,860
we have the fall of Icarus and then we

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:50,030
have the story of the fall of Icarus and

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,979
they're two different things what

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,680
happened to Icarus happened only to

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:57,970
Icarus but the story of what happened to

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,610
him belongs to us to make sense of and

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,470
to learn something from it you know it's

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,810
a story about hubris or about not

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:11,020
listening to your father's advice or or

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,020
about how nobody notices when you perish

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:20,930
Icarus and his moment have gone but the

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,860
story of the time remains and that's

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:27,800
ours to learn from so there's the time

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,800
and the record of the time and I'm

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:36,099
interested in the record of the time and

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,099
what we can learn from it as programmers

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,360
you probably know this famous definition

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,580
of insanity of madness that from Albert

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,909
Einstein that madness is doing the same

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,009
thing over and over again and expecting

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:54,590
different results except it actually

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:57,020
wasn't Einstein who said it was the

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,280
writer Rita Mae brown or apparently not

00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,900
Rita Mae brown maybe it was Mark Twain

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,520
but it's not Mark Twain it was an

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,930
ancient Chinese proverb and nobody

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,900
really knows where this came from

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:14,020
but we're programmers so we're familiar

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,360
with this experience have you ever found

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,139
yourself in the situation where you're

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,590
doing the same thing again after running

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,840
into unwanted behavior running exactly

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,479
the same code in exactly the same

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,770
circumstances as though you might get a

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,349
different result there is something

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,270
slightly mad about this and it's as

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,849
programmers it's an experience that

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,569
we're all familiar with so what's going

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:46,360
on what is this madness that afflicts us

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:48,129
programmers we're sitting there that

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,740
controls at the controls of our

00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:52,750
machinery doing the same thing again

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,889
because the results weren't what we were

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,779
what we expected and we do it again and

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:02,770
we watched in disbelief and when it

00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:15,879
crashes again all we can say is damn it

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:20,710
this can't be happening on the 31st of

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:25,509
May 2009 F France flight 447 was flying

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:28,150
from Rio in Brazil to Paris and it

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,210
encountered icing conditions about three

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,219
hours after takeoff and ice crystals

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,370
began to accumulate in the pitot tubes

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:40,569
these afford facing tubes that measure

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:44,500
our pressure and give an indicated

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:47,339
airspeed for the aircraft and because

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,529
they were blocked they started to give

00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,979
inconsistent readings and that caused

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:58,150
the autopilot to disengage and a warning

00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:01,089
sounded in the cockpit and because of

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,759
the turbulent conditions PS Cedric Bonin

00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:08,050
the pilot who was flying had to act to

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,839
correct the plane's direction and also

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,770
its attitude and as well as adjusting

00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:17,199
for roll he pulled back on the stick

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,770
causing the F aircraft to climb and

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,680
air speed and within just a minute the

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,530
icing event was over and the instruments

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,180
were all reporting correctly but the

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,080
plane had climbed to its maximum

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:35,260
altitude and it had lost air speed and

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,409
therefore lift it was in an X it was in

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,010
an excessive nose up position and it

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,950
began to stall and the storm the stall

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,900
alarm sounded in the cockpit and the

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,260
aircraft started to fall because it was

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,839
no longer flying and the pilots fought

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,100
the controls down towards the Atlantic

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,600
Ocean and they were desperately trying

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,490
to make sense of what was happening to

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,920
them and all the while banan

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,110
kept pulling back on his stick trying to

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:10,740
climb not realizing that what he was

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:13,420
doing was keeping the plane in a stall

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,950
the captain mugdha work had been on a

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,180
rest break was called back into the

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,560
cockpit and sat behind the two pilots

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,820
meanwhile the stall warning bled out

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,370
about 80 times and finally just a few

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,920
thousand feet above the water the first

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,700
officer and the captain realized what

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Bonin had been doing and they correctly

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,790
put the nose down so the plane could

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:44,380
pick up speed and recover and they were

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:47,890
late and the plane crashed into the

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:52,690
ocean and everybody all 228 people on

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,430
board perished those are amongst the

00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:00,250
last words on the cockpit voice

00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:06,070
recording so this incident has since

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:09,850
2009 had a hold on people's imagination

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,740
both within aviation and without it has

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,680
assumed the status of a myth like the

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:18,820
story of the Titanic or the story of

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,700
Icarus in which we hope we might find

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,770
some kind of deeper truth or meaning

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,200
that there might be some significant

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,839
mystery hidden in there how can we

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,250
explain how one of the safest most

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,860
reliable aircraft

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:36,190
in fact well the safest most reliable

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:41,260
machines that has ever been created came

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:44,320
to fall out of the sky because there was

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,020
no reason for their Airbus to crash the

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,090
crew weren't incapacitated the engines

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,250
were working the plane responded to the

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,920
controls there was nothing wrong with it

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:57,100
apart from a brief sensor error which

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,200
lasted about 60 seconds and it

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,680
functioned normally all the way down to

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:08,950
the ocean and people are magnetically

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,650
drawn to this story it's something that

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,590
sends a chill down people's spines I

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,070
don't know how many of people rode on an

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:22,570
Airbus a330 to get to this conference it

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,100
could it could be any of us it's

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,400
chilling to think of those people

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,240
falling out of the sky helplessly and

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,180
it's chilling because the story of what

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,110
happened in the cockpit is a story not

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,390
just of something going terribly wrong

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,750
but it's the story of a kind of madness

00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,770
that we find quite hard to look into

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:54,220
it's like staring into an abyss that is

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:57,340
very uncomfortable for us this is Laurie

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,630
Anderson the I don't know if anybody is

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,180
familiar with Laurie Anderson the

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,130
performer the musician so her piece from

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,350
the air is the story of an in-flight

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,060
emergency and it starts with the kind of

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,270
calm Authority that you would expect

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,890
from aviation but the captain announcing

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:16,180
that there's a problem and then it

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:19,720
descends into demented confusion it's

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:23,370
very well worth listening to maybe not

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,370
before you get on a flight

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,250
she points out that in an air crash

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,800
there are two times there's the time and

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,590
there's the record of the time in other

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,840
words there's the moment and there's the

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,590
retelling of the moment so there's the

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,790
time the moment that we live through and

00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,340
that's the time that belongs to us the

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:50,720
human world the world of flesh and blood

00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:54,110
or fear maybe here and now and there's

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,390
this other time that belongs to this

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,450
strange other world the world of the

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,210
aviation and the plane and its systems

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:07,430
and the data and the technology and the

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:10,220
numbers and all these facts that can

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,460
somehow be reconstructed after the event

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,280
even after the plane itself no longer

00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,770
exists so we have our time that we're

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,660
living in right now which is maybe

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,060
slightly confused and contradictory and

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,600
fleeting maybe counted out in its

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,250
remaining minutes and seconds and the

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,040
time that's going to be reconstructed

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,850
afterwards in the investigation to be

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,840
preserved forever so the time and the

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:42,130
record of the time and when our time

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,730
that we're in right now comes to an end

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:51,590
there might be a reconstruction of it

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:55,310
afterwards that um even though house is

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:59,750
gone can be preserved so only the record

00:13:55,310 --> 00:14:01,490
will remain and our time unfolds just

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,220
once and it goes only in one direction

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,460
and when it's over it it's over but the

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,050
record of the time can be slowed down it

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,300
can be paused and stopped it can be

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,020
played backwards and forwards over and

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,320
over again so in our time Air France

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,110
flight 447 is gone and those people are

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,460
gone but we still have the record of the

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:29,600
time and in the record of the time we

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,850
can suspend the fall of that aircraft in

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,640
maybe some merciful version of the story

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,810
the passengers are unaware or even

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,540
asleep they're unaware they're in the

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,650
cockpit some kind of madness has taken

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,930
hold and that the pilots are fighting

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,120
the controls that PS Cedric Bonin is

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:53,670
doing the same thing over and over again

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:56,450
and expecting a different result so

00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,180
we've been talking about madness and

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:03,930
which is a troubling term when you think

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,610
about it and people when they reflect on

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,230
some of these stories about aviation

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,360
will talk about pilot error and these

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,820
are both very unhelpful terms because

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,700
they're not very revealing and they're

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,440
quite judgmental and aviation has

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,810
developed ways of talking about these

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:24,029
things that are more useful and aviation

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,400
cause what happened in the cockpit loss

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:29,270
of situational awareness and what

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,250
happened is that banan robert indoor

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:35,010
lost situational awareness and it's what

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,690
happened with a pilot loses the true

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:42,330
picture of their situation when you lose

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,280
situational awareness all the cues all

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,020
the clues that you need might be staring

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,260
you in the face but because of a

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,850
contradiction with your expectations you

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,520
won't see them you can't see them and

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:58,260
you will fail to understand what they're

00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,270
telling you and in aviation loss of

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,190
situations loss of situational awareness

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,190
is absolutely deadly

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:17,569
it's a kind of cognitive breakdown and

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,610
there it's been studied in depth and

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:22,339
there are many different models of it

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,809
and but it hasn't I think we can say a

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,420
number of notable characteristics

00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:27,470
they're all closely related and they all

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,779
play into each other and we'll come back

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:35,709
to talk about these shortly but one of

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,209
the questions that I'm interested in is

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,290
does the same kind of madness or the

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:45,230
same kind of cognitive breakdown afflict

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,839
programmers and pilots when they make

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,350
apparently irrational judgments and

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,420
decisions and in order to answer that

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,829
question I think we have to look at more

00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,600
closely at programming to understand

00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,220
what it is that we aren't doing as

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,759
programmers what kind of thing is

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:09,409
programming and does anybody think

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:11,870
programming is a science it's not a

00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:16,159
science if some people think that it's a

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,329
science but it's not computer science is

00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,850
not concerned with programming is

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,189
concerned with computation a programming

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:25,220
is much more like engineering which is

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:27,649
also not a science did anybody think

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,090
engineering was a science and

00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:31,090
engineering not a science either

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,860
programming and engineering and piloting

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:41,840
aircraft are skills or crafts or arts

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,419
what in ancient Greece would be called

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,640
would be examples of techne which just

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,980
means skills and that's of course the

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
root of our word technology technology

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,399
is not concerned with iPhones and iPads

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,140
but with skills and in fact one of the

00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:00,260
examples of technique that Plato uses

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:03,260
all the time is of navigation piloting a

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,429
ship and we find many interesting

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,370
parallels between programming and

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:13,580
piloting so for example pair programming

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,620
has a counterpart in aviation in the to

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,140
pilot cockpit where you have a pilot

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,120
flying and a pilot monitoring all that

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,510
sometimes called the pilot not flying

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,090
and the pilot flying sits there managing

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,760
the controls and manipulating the

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,480
aircraft and the other one is telling

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:38,810
them what to do is managing the cockpit

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:40,510
is communicating and in the pair

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,920
programming analogy would be the person

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,610
sitting behind the person who's in front

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,040
of the keyboard and I'm interested in

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,530
some more parallels in this talk but

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:58,850
specifically about those where things

00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:02,030
start to go wrong now in nearly every or

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,910
perhaps in every craft in every skill

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,250
you'll find two activities two parts or

00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,940
phases of the craft that are part of the

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,920
cycle of exercising the craft and they

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,030
corresponds to two activities in the

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,880
craft of programming which is

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:22,280
programming itself and debugging so the

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,590
creative act of programming and the

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,730
troubleshooting the creative phase of

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,760
programming and the troubleshooting

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,540
phase of programming so we can call

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,450
these the primary and secondary

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,370
activities so the primary activity

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,430
programming is synthetic we're putting

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:40,130
things together the secondary activity

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:44,320
is analytic where we're trying to work

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:48,410
out what's going on in them assembly and

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,780
disassembly in programming we're moving

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:55,670
forwards in debugging we're moving

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:57,170
backwards into what we've done in the

00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,730
primary activity this is not just this

00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,570
is any kind of craft you know it could

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:05,510
be composing a piece of music the

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,840
primary activity is imaginative and goal

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,640
oriented but the secondary

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,840
troubleshooting part is logical and

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,370
problem oriented in the primary activity

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,880
we ask questions like how can we get

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:24,290
there from here and when we debug you're

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:27,110
thinking well how do we get here when

00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,040
we're in the primary activity we want to

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,620
make something happen

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,610
and when we're debugging trying to work

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:36,840
out why it's not working well

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:41,460
why isn't it happening so all crafts I

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,980
think ever exemplified this division but

00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,549
programming is unusual in how much of

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:54,179
our time is spent in that half of the

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:55,290
cycle yeah that's very unusual and I'm

00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,170
interested when I'm talking about

00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,820
programming in the debugging part of

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:04,919
programming not the programming part of

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:08,970
programming and that's something that we

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,669
don't tend to talk about very much this

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,309
side the synthetic side of programming

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,960
gets a lot of attention as a discipline

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,620
and the other doesn't

00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,270
so as an activity programming has some

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,070
methodologies and frameworks and

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,140
paradigms and models and a lot has been

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,970
said about practices about how teams

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,000
work how work can be planned and managed

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:33,210
and executed and so on but about

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,080
debugging very little is said which is

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,360
strange because everybody recognizes

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,660
just how much time we spend in that half

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,190
of the cycle and I think there are there

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:51,650
are reasons for this it's I don't think

00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:54,780
it's a mystery firstly

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:58,830
programming is a creative craft not all

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,559
crafts are creative and every program is

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,260
a new program otherwise you just used

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,049
one that existed already and that means

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,600
that it's completely acceptable for us

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,720
to get it wrong many times in order for

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,760
us to get it right once now that's

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,910
acceptable in programming in a way that

00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:26,100
it's completely unacceptable in cooking

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:29,429
or surgery when you're composing your

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:32,100
jazz masterpiece I expect you to go

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,280
through many wild and unsuccessful

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,270
iterations this is not what I expect to

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,840
happen when you invite me for dinner or

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,840
remove my appendix

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:48,300
when you're cooking a meal for someone

00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,070
or performing an operation on them the

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,020
person you're you're doing it for wants

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:57,440
to know that you've done this many times

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,440
before with the same outcome every time

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,480
so creative crafts necessarily created

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,820
crafts like programming necessarily

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,380
entail a lot more time spent in the

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,240
troubleshooting or debugging phase

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:15,360
because we're creating something a new

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:21,240
unlike the surgeon or the cook ouch

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,980
electric shock here's another reason why

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,690
we spend so much time debugging and

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:31,800
programming when failure comes in

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:34,490
programming it's unarguable when you're

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,970
a programmer your audience is the

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:41,370
interpreter or the compiler or whatever

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,320
if you're John Coltrane or Ornette

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,540
Coleman or something and the audience

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,430
don't really get your latest piece then

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,850
you're in a position to say well you're

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,290
not ready for it you know five it give

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,940
it five years time in you'll understand

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:58,320
or you know or your children will will

00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:01,650
get it when the pro when the interpreter

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:07,470
says that there's an error you don't get

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:09,990
to argue so you know a painting or a

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:13,010
piece of writing the question does it

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,360
work for a while at least can be an open

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,890
question and it's an aesthetic question

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,990
and we mean things like does it ring

00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,960
true is it beautiful or elegant does it

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,970
produce the dark desired effect it's a

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,950
matter of judgment in the case of a

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:30,780
program it's not a matter of a judgement

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:33,990
because the computer is telling you and

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:37,770
you don't get to have any judgments

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:39,930
about it given the inputs the program

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,990
will either produce the expected output

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:47,730
or will not in the worst case it will

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:50,850
actually crash rather than merely giving

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,410
incorrect results so you can consider

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,570
whether your writing works when you're

00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,270
writing a

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,059
some pros you look at again from

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,620
different angles from different lights

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:02,270
you can sleep on it you can't do that

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,770
with a with a program it either works or

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,020
it doesn't and no amount of considering

00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,059
is going to change that you've had your

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:11,720
answer now it's time to start debugging

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:14,780
so straight away as soon as we try it

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,299
out if it goes wrong debugging time for

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,270
you

00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:23,299
another reason in programming trying

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,309
again is nearly instantaneous and cost

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,110
free you know when I do it let's just

00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:31,610
press up in the terminal and then hit

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:33,260
return again we are very short cost try

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,470
it again cycle and it means we're

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,390
tempted to do the same thing again

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,450
immediately now if you're an engineer I

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,530
mean the other kind of you know the

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,730
engineer engineer it's not the software

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,730
engineers that let's not fool ourselves

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,640
even if we fool others let's not fool

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,799
ourselves

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,580
if you're an engineer trying to work out

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,620
why a machine is not working as expected

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,600
the cost of try it again can be

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,340
time-consuming and huge it could take

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,809
hours it could destroy the machine you

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,890
know people are building bridges and

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:10,700
dams maybe have one chance to get it

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:13,460
right and they don't think well let's

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,530
give it a go let's see if the dam will

00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,330
hold the water it doesn't work like that

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:23,299
in structural engineering imagine your

00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:26,169
pressure after your first attempt to

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,570
build the dam didn't quite work out but

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:31,580
for us as programmers try it again can

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,200
be done immediately and it costs us

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,270
nothing so very little gets in the

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:47,660
Temptation of the wait list

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:49,340
try it again similarly feedback from our

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,280
errors or from our attempts in

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,410
programming is nearly instantaneous and

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,419
cost free and it means that we're

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:59,179
tempted to try things just to see if

00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,960
they'll work so engineer an engineer

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,880
will need to think very carefully

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,510
through through the implications of

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,429
their latest modifications to decide

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:09,799
what the effects will be in front of our

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:12,500
computers we get that feedback at no

00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,070
cost without going even to the trouble

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,470
of thinking it through so there's very

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,030
little to stop us from trying to get the

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,380
feedback that we want

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:28,220
and finally debugging is mostly a

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:31,360
private affair the programmer the code

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:37,850
and the error is a horrific menage tois

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:41,870
and debugging is a private misery it's

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:44,929
you know it's like throwing up or a

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,510
relationship that's not working it's to

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:54,710
be endured in private until it's over

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:57,679
and so yeah so the debugging it stays in

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,940
our heads programmers don't like talking

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,280
about debugging while they're doing it

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,320
because debugging is the admission of an

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,690
ongoing failure of something almost

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,190
embarrassing that it might talking about

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,080
in fact they love talking about it after

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,650
oh you'll never believe this bug that I

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:16,700
found and you know and some outcomes

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,740
some lengthy war story and it but that's

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:24,770
afterwards you know that's when the

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:26,990
misery is behind them it's not what they

00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:31,490
want to do during the process and so

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:34,150
programmers fight with the code alone so

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,520
all these things come together and they

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,559
tip the programmer more quickly into

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,049
debugging than happens in other crafts

00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,650
and they keep the programmer there more

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:48,590
firmly than happens in other crafts and

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,409
they form a really vicious cycle in

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,559
which the response of the programmer is

00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:57,260
to try again in a short cycle with no

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,809
time to step back or consider and it's a

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,400
closed cycle in which the programmer is

00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:03,380
disinclined to get away from this

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:09,200
horrible little orbit of the error and

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:12,320
the code to talk to someone else and so

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,000
there we are programmers debugging

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,860
finding ourselves doing the same thing

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,940
again as if we expected a different

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,700
result fighting our controls and

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:26,910
it's a kind of madness but we know we

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:33,570
should call it loss we should call it

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:37,600
it's cognitive breakdown and what I'm

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:41,040
wanting to argue here is that the nature

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:45,040
of debugging itself tends to provoke

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,940
cognitive breakdown in us so if you want

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,940
to use the word madness I'm arguing that

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:55,270
debugging it has a tendency to tip us

00:29:51,940 --> 00:30:00,270
into madness but debugging itself

00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:00,270
provokes loss of situational awareness

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,960
so I'm arguing that the activity of

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,570
debugging is responsible for producing

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,990
the same kind of cognitive breakdown

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,990
that taught flight 447 out of the sky

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:23,080
you're a web application developer and

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,910
you're trying to restart an application

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,210
that crashed and you've checked the logs

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:30,130
and you've flushed the caches and you've

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,980
restarted the application and you

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,750
restarted the web server and now you're

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,000
actually logged in directly to the

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,010
server with a terminal inserting your

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,670
print functions into the code and you're

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:45,130
desperate for any clue and this can't be

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:48,250
happening and the next thing you know

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,110
you're in the grip of this madness doing

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,840
things that you wouldn't normally ever

00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,110
dream of doing like changing production

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,860
code on the fly or trying to reconfigure

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:01,930
the web application gateway and finally

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,180
you discover what is happening you have

00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:07,510
been doing all these desperate and

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,760
futile things on the wrong server you

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:14,050
are typing the commands into the wrong

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,750
terminal window because you are

00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,230
desperate for clues but you couldn't see

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,790
them

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,280
and you wouldn't see them though they

00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:24,580
were staring you in the face because you

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,470
were you lost situational awareness and

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,470
you are too busy fighting your controls

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,090
your debugging

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,460
complex algorithm that was working until

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,500
yesterday when you made some minor and

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,120
insignificant changes and you know this

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,730
algorithm inside out because you've been

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,640
living inside it for a month and somehow

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,260
it's logic is collapsing all around you

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,810
so you start taking it apart piece by

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,400
tiny piece changing and checking and

00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,170
rechecking parts of it you know can't

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,060
possibly have anything to do with the

00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,040
problem that you're seeing and then

00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:58,260
change it so much that your own mental

00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,810
model of it starts to break down and

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:05,790
dammit this can't be happening and then

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:08,220
finally you realize that something else

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:15,090
changed and your algorithm was receiving

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:17,910
different data from before you dived

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:20,520
into a deep debugging rabbit hole

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,140
chasing after a completely irrelevant

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,240
solution to your problem

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,570
there was absolutely nothing wrong with

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,460
your algorithm at all in the first place

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,010
but you lost situational awareness

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,330
because you were too busy fighting your

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:39,060
controls and then you fly your plane

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:48,480
into the sea tell yourself that this

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:53,150
can't be happening so programmers and

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,880
pilots face this common enemy of

00:32:53,150 --> 00:33:00,180
cognitive breakdown and loss of

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,090
situational awareness what can we do

00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,710
about it well it happens to us as

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,680
programmers and it makes us look and

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:11,180
feel foolish and when it happens to

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,770
pilots they die so unsurprisingly

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,010
aviation has developed very effective

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,290
strategies to mitigate loss of

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:22,380
situational awareness to prevent it in

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,270
the first place and to recover it when

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,000
it starts to falter and what they do is

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:30,720
target the kinds of cognitive breakdown

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that characterized it so I mentioned

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,380
these briefly I alluded to them earlier

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,520
these characteristics of cognitive

00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,170
breakdown so very briefly be ok your

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,999
eyes got a blind spot if you close one

00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,089
eye and you're at the right

00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:50,129
since from that you will only see one

00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:51,839
spot it will be literally impossible for

00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,579
you to see their spot because your eye

00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,899
has a blind spot where the optic nerve

00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:59,669
leaves the back of the eye and if that

00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:03,749
dots in your blind spot it's impossible

00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:05,339
to see blind spots are absolutely deadly

00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:07,919
they don't just obscure what you're

00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,109
seeing what if they don't just obscure

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,730
what you're not seeing rather they also

00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:15,240
obscure the fact that you have a blind

00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:18,389
spot in the first place a blind spot

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,339
obscures its own existence you can't

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,549
even tell if you have a blind spot and

00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:26,190
we all live with blind spots of literal

00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:29,460
physical kinds and other kinds cognitive

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,279
and perceptual kinds - and new ones can

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,250
appear at any moment and the only way to

00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:37,529
see past a blind spot is by introducing

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,099
a new perspective being by shifting your

00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:42,990
position opening your other eye or

00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:49,169
inviting a another party to look at the

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:51,210
situation another observer faulty mental

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:53,309
models we all rely on our mental models

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,129
of the world we don't reconstruct our

00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:57,779
picture of the world completely anew in

00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:59,640
every single instant we have a model of

00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:01,109
the world and we work with that we have

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,779
to be able to internalize the outside

00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,480
world in order to be able to deal with

00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:07,769
it so we create this subjective

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,569
representation for ourselves and the

00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:13,430
more complex the world that we're

00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:13,430
dealing with then the more complex our

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,690
mental model needs to be when that model

00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:24,150
breaks down we need to rebuild it based

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,759
on the world itself based on something

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:30,769
from an objective reality outside our

00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:32,849
subjective representations from it and

00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:37,230
Germans are very useful language in all

00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:38,730
kinds of ways not least because of the

00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,490
way it makes its words in German there

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,430
are two words for object there's ding as

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,190
it as in thing and there's Gagan stand

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:52,230
and gegen stand means literally

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:55,259
something like a stand against against

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:58,289
stand so objectivity is something is

00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:59,040
that which we can stand against some

00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,440
other thing that

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:08,130
it's outside ourselves that is not

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,960
ourselves and just like Archimedes said

00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,600
you know if you give me a Leever long

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,450
enough in a firm place to stand you can

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,660
I can move the world well when it comes

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,520
to knowing the world we need a piece of

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,710
the world that we can firmly stand

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,960
against that won't give way when we

00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:31,860
press against it with our assumptions or

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,120
beliefs so this other thing that's

00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,260
outside ourselves it doesn't need to be

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,780
the whole world it just needs to be a

00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,110
piece of the world that we can get hold

00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:44,430
of and use to start rebuilding a working

00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:47,670
mental model misjudging cause and effect

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:50,160
well we don't see cause we don't see

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,040
causality itself at work in the world we

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,780
just see we just have observations and

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,220
then we make judgments so we said we

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,630
judge that this was the cause and that

00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,760
was the effect we don't see the

00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,820
causality itself working in between them

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,940
and making judgments about cause and

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,670
effect is a very troublesome business at

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,620
the best of times but in complex and

00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,390
stressful situations it's very easy to

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:16,650
make the wrong judgments about cause and

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:20,390
effect in flight 447 the flight

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:22,890
computers alerted the crew to the stall

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:25,470
but when Bonin pulled back on the

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:29,040
control stick and the planes angle of

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:31,380
attack increased beyond a certain degree

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,310
the flight computers were receiving such

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,650
anomalous data that the stall warning is

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,630
the stall warning stopped because the

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,270
the plane could make no sense whatsoever

00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,310
at what was happening when he sometimes

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,890
on the way down let go in the plane

00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,690
recovered the plane could once more make

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:53,130
sense of what was happening and the

00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:56,850
stole alarm set off again so and he

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:59,970
wants more pulled back and then the

00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:04,350
warning stopped so he was trapped in

00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:07,440
this horrific loop of feedback in which

00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:11,020
apparent effects were 180 degrees out of

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,010
phase with their causes

00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:17,109
and rescue and rescuing our judgments

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,490
about cause and effect in the world

00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:21,040
means pulling them out of these

00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,869
stressful and tights loops by making

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,839
them clear and explicit so they can be

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:27,490
corrected and checked and that's just

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,330
what didn't happen in flight four for

00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:37,480
sale and finally poor decision-making

00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:40,119
now private decision-making is almost

00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,140
always of a poor quality if it stays

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:47,550
inside your head our reasoning our

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:50,800
thinking needs to be made explicit

00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,210
banan's reasoning if he'd said what he

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
was doing to the other members of the

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:58,119
crew it would have been immediately and

00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:02,339
obviously faulty and as panic set in his

00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,339
actions became more and more irrational

00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,780
but they went unchallenged because his

00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,820
decision-making stayed inside his head

00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,710
where it couldn't be challenged or

00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,790
corrected and and the other members of

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,369
the crew actually made some poor

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,710
decisions two decisions that were

00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:21,700
revealed implicitly in their actions and

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:23,589
remarks but never explicitly brought out

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:27,010
into the light where they would have

00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:33,099
withered on the spot if they had have

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:35,290
been exposed to the light so aviation

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:37,930
has spent over a century learning how to

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,630
deal with these problems and the lessons

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:43,330
are woven into the training of every

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,589
pilot and in aviation Khan didn't break

00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:50,619
down his address through very very

00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:54,010
simple and practical procedures in

00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:55,300
aviation everything is on a checklist it

00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,369
doesn't matter how many times you've

00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,720
followed a certain procedure how many

00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:02,890
times that day you've followed a certain

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,790
procedure you do it working with a

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:09,369
written checklist so this is a 747

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:11,080
freighter checklist for use it says

00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:14,109
normal operating checklists so this is

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,390
for the the primary activity of flying

00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:18,670
the normal activity of flying the the

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,380
programming part of programming as it

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:24,609
were this is the left-hand side of that

00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:26,920
earlier column it's everything you do

00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,790
will do in a flight from before starting

00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,130
until the flight is completely

00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:37,030
terminated and these are a couple of

00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,400
pages from the a330 quick reference

00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,320
handbook which is for the secondary

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,940
activity of flying the debugging part

00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,780
emergency procedures it's a big I think

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,099
there are a couple of handle anyway

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,050
they're big books and they're down in

00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:52,030
the pockets by the side of the pilots

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,530
each one has one so the minute something

00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,720
goes wrong they're supposed to whip them

00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,599
out and put them on the lap the pilot

00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,400
not flying will have it on their lap and

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,099
the other one will be select the

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,089
controls and their checklist just about

00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:09,490
everything only for a few instants will

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:12,250
in an emergency will the pilot be

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,630
working on their own resources as Bonham

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,710
should have done in a few seconds after

00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:22,839
he had to take control over from the

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:27,750
autopilot but then they should have gone

00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:27,750
straight to the quick reference handbook

00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:32,320
instead of banan relying on his training

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,599
and his experience in his memory of

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,770
procedures instead he fought the

00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:41,349
controls and one of the things that a

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:45,480
checklist like this does is serve as an

00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:47,950
alternative perspective it helps avoid

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,050
blind spots because your memory and

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,820
judgments and reasoning might all be

00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,950
faulty but when you're following a

00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,859
procedure that requires you to check and

00:41:53,950 --> 00:42:00,339
confirm something a checklists allows

00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:02,530
you to step outside of yourself it helps

00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:04,900
you rebuild a mental model that has gone

00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,280
wrong particularly those parts of it

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,580
that you might have skipped over in a

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,930
hurry because they seemed insignificant

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,880
it gives Gagan stand it gives you

00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:16,930
something to stand against something

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,369
what some objectivity and we don't

00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,950
really use these in programming

00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:24,150
sometimes we use them for system

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:26,680
operations sometimes we use them for

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:30,030
programming but I've never seen them

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,030
used in debugging

00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:42,020
in aviation communication is always

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:43,520
explicit and verified so I'll say does

00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,500
the other pilot passingly you have the

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,390
controls panel say I have the controls

00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,109
and repeat it back to me

00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,549
so we'll be we've cross-checked or

00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,500
descending to flight level 330 and the

00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:57,280
power will say yes descending to flight

00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:02,750
level 350

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,030
so this addresses all of those elements

00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,470
in cognitive breakdown it brings in

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,849
another perspective it gives us what

00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,309
someone else is thinking who's not our

00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:12,700
self it tells us what they're doing it

00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:17,809
helps rebuild and repair mental models

00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:20,450
it makes actions and decisions clearer

00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:23,270
helping connect cause and effect and it

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,250
exposes our thinking processes it makes

00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:30,260
them public revealing any flaws that

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:31,579
might be in them so 350 and then you'd

00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,910
know if you keep that inside your head

00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:39,380
nobody will know if you misheard 350 or

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:42,980
it was supposed to be 330 and in flight

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:48,950
4 4 7 this communication breakdown was

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:52,099
part of the cognitive breakdown and it's

00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:54,770
painful to read this because banan had

00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:57,520
been pulling back on the stick trying to

00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:00,319
climb and the other pilots didn't know

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,740
because he hadn't told them what he was

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,140
doing

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,430
robear had been put on the other side of

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,980
the cockpit robear had been pushing

00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:10,160
forward on the stick to the nose but the

00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:13,960
system was in this dual input mode where

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,450
it sums the inputs from the two sticks

00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:22,309
so they were cancelling each other out

00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:24,799
and robear had not made his own actions

00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:27,260
explicit either so nobody in the cockpit

00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:29,200
knew what the others were doing until it

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,160
was too late

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,530
and we see this all the time in

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:40,090
debugging so this is just from the

00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:43,450
Chango IRC channel the moment that

00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:45,400
he spelled out his problem the answer

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:49,390
was immediately apparent to him because

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:52,300
he spelled it out and this happens to me

00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:54,400
all the time and you don't need an IRC

00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,340
channel or a co-pilot you can just tell

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,110
it to the wall and so sometimes the act

00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:07,240
on description will turn out to be 90%

00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:11,170
of the way to the solution now stress

00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:15,610
and panic drive us into tighter loops of

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:18,490
decision of bad decision-making one of

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:20,920
the things that well the one thing that

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:23,680
aircraft do really really well is fly

00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,750
and an airliner wants only to do one

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,660
thing which is to fly level and in a

00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,700
straight line and if banan had simply

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,980
let go of the controls when the

00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,870
autopilot disengaged the plane would

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,940
have maybe moved from its course a bit

00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:39,160
or being bumped a bit about by the

00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,900
turbulence but that would have been the

00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,540
most significant outcome of the event

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,190
and at almost any point in the next few

00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,340
minutes he got to simply let go of the

00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:53,320
controls and everything would have been

00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:55,960
alright the aircraft would have

00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,540
recovered its attitude and its airspeed

00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:03,210
and they would all have lived if he had

00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,210
stopped and done nothing

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,350
don't just do something sit there

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:18,030
so simply doing nothing will allow an

00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,480
aircraft to recover and it will allow

00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:23,460
the pilot to recover - to recover from

00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,220
the cognitive breakdown and a pilot

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,960
can't do nothing indefinitely but it's

00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,930
possible for longer than you think even

00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,180
in an emergency situation and as

00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:39,540
programmers we can stop and do nothing

00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:41,730
almost indefinitely if we walk away from

00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,950
the computer and return half an hour

00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,100
later or half a week later we will find

00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:49,650
it's sitting patiently in exactly the

00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,090
same situation as we left it when it

00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,400
crashed or gave the unexpected result

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:55,560
and there's no need for us to do

00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,780
anything immediately so usually we

00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,160
shouldn't and often the best thing we

00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,630
can do is get away from the code I know

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,830
I've sold far more problems you know

00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:09,210
riding home from work on my bicycle or

00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,440
washing the dishes than I have while

00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:14,010
sitting in front of the computer and

00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,590
I've certainly caused less damage yeah

00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,420
which is you know we always think about

00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,710
what we'll achieve but we less often

00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,350
think about that how much damage we're

00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,910
going to do so we could learn to do

00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,220
these things as programmers we could

00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,110
learn to adopt checklists it wouldn't be

00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,110
very hard to devise checklists for

00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:33,030
programming and debugging we can improve

00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:36,420
the way we communicate so that we do

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:38,280
nothing and don't even think anything

00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,020
without exposing it to another person

00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,870
but you know the idea of programmers

00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,490
pair debugging you know it's like people

00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,250
just want to throw up on their own in

00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,950
private it's it's a mmmm

00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,810
programmers want to be on their own

00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,560
where the debugging and the last thing

00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,930
they want to do is communicate

00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:00,270
explicitly but we could try but we

00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:05,730
should most importantly of all is learn

00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:08,580
to stop fighting the controls these are

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,740
all ways of getting away from a failed

00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,780
failing perspective always of stepping

00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,240
outside ourselves and finding something

00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:18,460
else in the universe to stand against to

00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,710
get a grip on their ways to reset

00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,299
failed thinking and prevent bad

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,500
judgments and decisions and they can

00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:26,780
work in programming the same way they

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,339
work in aviation and they do work in

00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,440
aviation we're talking about flight four

00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:32,750
four seven because not because it's a

00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,849
good example of what happens but because

00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:38,780
it's an example of what never happens a

00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:43,280
once-in-a-lifetime event

00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:47,510
a staggering extraordinary event because

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:51,049
flying on an airliner is an

00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,569
outstandingly safe way to travel and in

00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:54,680
the meantime other disciplines like

00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:57,799
Nursing and the nuclear industry and

00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,280
surgery have started to adopt techniques

00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:03,770
and methodologies from strategies from

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,430
aviation to make their work safer and

00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:09,650
keep it safer and programmers we'd love

00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,380
to talk about programming about the

00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:14,049
theory and practice of programming and

00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,069
but we don't like to theorize about

00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:17,780
debugging the debugging part of

00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:20,510
programming as though it were indeed us

00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:27,680
slightly embarrassing private misery and

00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:31,089
I think that needs to change in an air

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:36,619
crash as I said there's the time and

00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:39,109
there's the record of the time and in

00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:41,299
aviation the record of the time is

00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:43,970
painstakingly built up and it's

00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:46,700
scrutinized and it's replayed endlessly

00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:49,460
so that it won't be repeated in another

00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,410
tragic loss and we rarely do anything

00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,390
like this in programming we have

00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:59,270
perfunctory awkward post-mortems over

00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:01,819
things that went wrong at the best so we

00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,319
don't dwell on our failures in debugging

00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:05,270
and we rarely confront them in the same

00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:07,190
way and that's really strange because

00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,589
everybody agreed that we spent so much

00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,059
time in that half of the programming

00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:16,279
cycle the debugging half the

00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:18,559
troubleshooting half so we're so often

00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:21,650
caught up in the moment in the time and

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:25,150
we pay such little attention to the

00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:27,619
record of the time but aviators do and

00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:29,890
we can learn from their lessons without

00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,850
having to pay the price that they paid

00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:35,510
to learn them and we can

00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:39,800
make use of the same techniques so we

00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:41,630
could adopt these and they work even for

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,940
people as mad and tragic as programmers

00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,380
I'm sure and so the next time you find

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,050
yourself thinking you know dammit this

00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:51,620
can't be happening you can try working

00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:53,930
your way or actually first try stop and

00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,550
then start doing some other things and

00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,470
you can even use these things when

00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:59,090
you're fruitfully to solve other

00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:02,980
problems and crises like a

00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:06,710
malfunctioning shower or relationship

00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:08,930
but these things work in aviation

00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,270
because they're built into it at every

00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,300
level not because you read about it on

00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:17,710
the web or somebody talked about it at a

00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:21,020
conference in aviation it's safety is

00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,450
and these practices are a defining part

00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,220
of the culture and processes and the

00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:28,550
truth is that as individuals we could

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,680
only ever get so far there's some only

00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,630
so much we can do as individuals whereas

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,610
in aviation everything is very

00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,610
systematic and cultural and fundamental

00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:41,600
the individual pilots use of those

00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,550
techniques works because they're part of

00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:48,500
the culture and until our debugging

00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,570
mistakes kill us and our colleagues now

00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:58,700
our customers our industry probably

00:51:50,570 --> 00:52:01,690
isn't going to change that much this is

00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:05,060
the record of the time of a

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:07,190
reconstruction of one awful moment and

00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,530
in programming we don't have the courage

00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,350
or the stomach to look back into our

00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:14,990
agonizing losses and and taste them

00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:16,700
again in the retelling and in aviation

00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:18,740
they do because they want to discover

00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:23,600
what went wrong and ensure that it shall

00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:26,030
not happen again so in in programmers

00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,570
we're like lovers who after a bitter al

00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,280
we fall into tender lovemaking because

00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,720
we want to dissolve the bitterness into

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,130
sweetness and forget it and leave it

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,880
behind and put it behind us and just

00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:40,550
move on yeah and it was bad enough to

00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:42,770
taste the bitterness in the moment but

00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:45,080
the idea of tasting and again in a

00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,630
deliberate reconstruction is

00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,320
an appalling thought so love is just

00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:55,820
like programmers are really unwilling to

00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:57,530
go back and linger there and when we

00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,510
escape the clutches of some

00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,700
endures debugging experience it feels

00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,220
you know feels like somehow being born

00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,930
again you know you've got a second

00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,800
chance you've you've got a new life

00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:12,950
starting and then we only want to live

00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,810
and move forward you know for me it

00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,300
feels like when I come out of one of

00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,280
those horrific debugging sessions that

00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,750
I've stepped onto a new road at the

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,860
start of a new day and now I just want

00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:26,570
to move forward the idea of turning

00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:31,030
round to stare back again at my knight

00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:33,770
of horrors is extremely unappealing and

00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:36,200
this is understandable but the problem

00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:39,980
is that at worst it's immature even

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:43,100
infantile because if we can only bear to

00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,600
tell and hear sweet stories we'll never

00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:48,080
learn the lessons of the the really

00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:54,770
bitter ones the ones that do hold the

00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:58,310
deepest truths and alien has the courage

00:53:54,770 --> 00:54:01,910
to return to its bitter its bitterest

00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:04,520
moments painstakingly and to recreate

00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:10,970
them it returns a thousand times to each

00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:14,000
of its deaths aviation is or aviators

00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:17,870
are more mature and courageous than

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,650
programmers or lovers I'm afraid and

00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:24,860
that's because they have to be and this

00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:28,130
is a tale of two industries because

00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:33,110
aviation paid for each of its lessons

00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:36,440
with people's lives people died to make

00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:38,570
aviation safe in aviation when you're

00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,660
flying every time you break a rule

00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:43,820
skip it something in a checklist think

00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,290
you remember something every time you do

00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,620
something a slightly different way

00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:53,110
because you happen to feel like doing it

00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:56,460
you're literally dishonouring the dead

00:54:53,110 --> 00:55:04,720
by skipping a checklist

00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:10,930
in programming and I don't think it's

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:13,140
going to change so um thank you very

00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,140
much

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,769
be very happy to have any questions

00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:33,769
about any of this and your thoughts

00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:46,680
thank you very much very very worthwhile

00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:48,269
talk thank you you have kind of covered

00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,609
this but I last asked the question

00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:51,839
Arielle wants to know you don't give

00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:53,819
much hope for this change what do you

00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:57,650
think it would take to change a short of

00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:57,650
people dying from programming errors I

00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:09,809
think the automated testing movement if

00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:11,460
you call it movement is probably the the

00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:13,589
closest thing that we have to this kind

00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:19,109
of approach a kind of safety first

00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:20,819
approach that emphasizes process rather

00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,859
than outcomes because of programs were

00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:24,660
fixated on outcomes on where we're going

00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:27,210
whereas in aviation they're really

00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,470
concerned about the processes and I

00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,650
think that's maybe something we could

00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,029
build on I don't think well so what do

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:38,849
you think it would take to convince an

00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:40,140
industry to adopt this III don't think I

00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:42,150
don't think there is anything that will

00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:45,930
honestly I think maybe in in small

00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:47,190
cultures we might be able to take steps

00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,950
in that direction and maybe that will

00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:57,720
have an effective you if you know people

00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:59,700
do it but I'm not too optimistic the

00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:05,220
same thing goes for them not just

00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:07,140
programmers but others as well in the

00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,940
DevOps movement I have a post-mortem

00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:15,539
practice do you see that as a positive

00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:18,119
sign yes although you know compared to

00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:20,970
the way that post-mortems are conducted

00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:24,420
in aviation it's still nowhere near that

00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:26,880
the depth and importance that it has in

00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,999
in aviation but again you know the the

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,980
blame free postmortem that's becoming

00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:34,109
very important in things like nursing

00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,880
and surgery where when something goes

00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:38,269
wrong it might literally be a

00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,269
post-mortem

00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:48,359
you meet to look at things in a way that

00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:52,229
will allow the the truth however bitter

00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:55,979
it is to come out so that's again

00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:59,970
another potentially hopeful angle in

00:57:55,979 --> 00:58:03,900
words to this you've talked a lot about

00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:04,799
the importance of using checklists for

00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,809
debugging

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,229
has anybody developed a good debugging

00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:12,690
checklist that's generally useful

00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:14,279
actually that's very useful and it's

00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,299
only got one item in here so far which

00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:28,589
says make sure you're in the right

00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:37,380
terminal window and the last time I had

00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:41,009
to use it I forgot to use it you know so

00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,479
even without checklists it seems to me

00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:43,859
that pair programming does at least

00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:45,989
alleviate some of these issues

00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:51,029
definitely so if you had any experience

00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:52,769
with programming a little but I think

00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:54,569
what we need is to have pair debugging

00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:56,130
what you know programming that that's

00:58:54,569 --> 00:58:57,630
great how are we the creating new thing

00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:02,249
and everyone's really excited and so on

00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:04,170
and when it gets the stage when the this

00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:05,309
thing is going wrong and they can't even

00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:09,029
bear to look each other in the eye

00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:10,170
that's when they need to do pairing you

00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:11,670
know when they want to put their

00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,039
headphones on and listen to their awful

00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:16,440
music and stare at the screen you know

00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:18,140
not not when it's at the beginning of

00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,400
the project when everything you know

00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,739
it's like setting out on on it on a

00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,940
brand new walk on a brand new day in in

00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:25,529
the moments of horror when they've got

00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:30,150
to stare into this thing and each

00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:31,979
other's faces which is very difficult so

00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,869
and I've never had experience of that

00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:34,750
because nobody will talk to me when

00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:37,080
they're debugging

00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,880
[Music]

00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,440
and like Pope Pete on that Django IRC

00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,960
you know he's been taking three hours to

00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:49,180
ask his question that just asking us

00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,599
sold it for him a checklist with one

00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,790
item

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,700
have you tried or use any other

00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:57,280
principles from aviation yourself for

00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,750
example I don't know but check this is

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,220
one but if you try to me additional

00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:03,130
things herself to try them better you

01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,840
better your quality I guess well one

01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,730
thing that the thing that has worked

01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,680
best for me is to go and ride my bicycle

01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:18,070
actually that's that is normally where

01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:21,250
things get solved checklists and and and

01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:27,010
and not staring at the code anymore

01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:36,099
really helps not a question just a quick

01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:37,540
story but in the in the 80s know at the

01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:41,140
end if it's really quick maybe you can

01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:42,730
give it here enough crowd if you're

01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,369
doing embedded programming in the

01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:47,500
medical industry you can kill people

01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:50,530
and so the therac-25 is the kind of the

01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,330
famous example of that can we borrow any

01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,490
of the practices from those fields of

01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,140
programming that are you're extremely

01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:59,320
quality focused and apply them more

01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:03,640
generally and of course we could but you

01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:05,349
know we are we're here yes this is this

01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,780
is our culture you know this is what

01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:09,400
we're doing I'm a web application

01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:13,240
programmer so I'm with the lowest of the

01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:19,570
low you know who cares if our crummy web

01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:21,700
applications crash so if something goes

01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:27,670
wrong with Facebook and embarrassment at

01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:30,849
worst so that part of the industry

01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:36,160
unlike you know software in aviation or

01:01:30,849 --> 01:01:38,080
medicine has very good reason to spend a

01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,490
huge amount of money and time doing

01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:46,200
things the right way but our world

01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,200
doesn't does not

01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:52,990
I loved seeing the the checklist from

01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,460
the a380 is to run an ops team for her

01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:56,950
for a large company and we loved our

01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,960
checklists the problem is is that when a

01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,070
checklist doesn't have an item for the

01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,650
thing that you're currently dealing with

01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,910
people become disenfranchised Oh check

01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,910
this doesn't help I'm going on my own

01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:08,320
and you build a sort of a culture of

01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:10,120
heroes that solve it without the

01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,320
checklist but writing checklist is

01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,330
really hard it requires a sort of a

01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,210
creativity that a lot of people don't

01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:17,050
have your your great comment which is

01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:20,050
why is this happening

01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:21,670
is also this couldn't possibly happen

01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,690
and you don't write a checklist work

01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,980
because of course that will never happen

01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,540
we'll never have four-engine flameouts

01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:28,960
or something like that how do you

01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:30,550
culturally encourage people to be to say

01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,570
really bluntly like more creative about

01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,720
how things can go wrong

01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:36,040
Oh I mean first I'd say that you know if

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,420
anyone's relying on me to encourage

01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,460
other programmers to do anything they

01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,930
might I'll run away out of this room

01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,050
screaming because you don't want to take

01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:50,440
any practices or advice from me that's

01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:54,730
for sure I don't you know I'm I'm not an

01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:59,020
expert on on this at all you know I'm

01:02:54,730 --> 01:03:00,550
not I can't give you my crappy little

01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:03,190
checklist that I forget to use is the

01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:06,130
best I've come to to doing anything here

01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:08,380
but I think that maybe people who are

01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:11,620
better and more experienced programmers

01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:16,330
and debuggers than I am will be able to

01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:17,740
do this because I find myself I say I

01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,630
don't have the wit or the imagination to

01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,280
come up with checklists longer than one

01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:24,790
item so far maybe if I keep working on

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,740
it but think how much time we spend it

01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:29,470
in in that part of the of the of the

01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:31,690
cycle if at least we wrote some things

01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,070
down while we were there instead of

01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,780
fighting with the controls don't forget

01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,820
you know the computer's not going to

01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,110
fall out of the sky if we stop fighting

01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,540
the controls for a second so we've got

01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:42,070
that luxury or at least maybe making a

01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:43,840
note of what happened while it's

01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:46,290
happening would be something novel for

01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,290
us for example

01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:58,770
yeah FLA is a bit unfair to the

01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:01,589
programmers because when we were in the

01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:04,320
business a lot of time we do not have

01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:06,869
controls the project manager says hey

01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,540
this got a deal that like you had to

01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:12,030
meet that so I felt like a lot of time

01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,849
we should communicate with people who

01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:17,130
don't have technical background there's

01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:18,950
a very important some of these this

01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:21,810
knowledge is shared with the

01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:23,700
non-technical people because it's really

01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:26,359
hard when you got a deadline and say hey

01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:29,400
I can move far as I have to do these

01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:30,780
yeah I don't know what that's another

01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,930
thing definitely that's something that

01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:37,130
can be learnt from aviation where one

01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:41,010
one of the deadliest things that can

01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:43,080
manifest in the cockpit is a Authority

01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:46,580
gradient where there is a senior pilot

01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:49,650
and a junior pilot and the junior pilot

01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:53,330
feels reluctant to contradict or

01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:56,040
question the actions or decisions of the

01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:59,640
senior pilot that's absolutely deadly so

01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:02,869
they've worked extremely hard to

01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:06,810
eradicate that to make it possible for

01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:09,660
any pilot to question another pilot it's

01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:12,240
been very interesting in in many Asian

01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:16,740
cultures how in the last 20 years or so

01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,770
they have transferred KL Korean Airlines

01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:24,180
has worked extremely hard on this over

01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:28,520
the last few decades and because there

01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:31,349
are cultural attitudes to Authority in

01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:33,960
some parts of the world where it's very

01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:37,320
difficult to do things like questions

01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:39,570
somebody who's senior to you but it can

01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:42,750
be done even in the face of deeply

01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:45,660
ingrained cultural expectations and

01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:47,640
values and again that's something else

01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:51,680
in in surgery and nursing where even the

01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:55,849
lowest person in the operating theater

01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:58,830
now in in in in some practices is

01:05:55,849 --> 01:06:01,619
empowered to speak up or to question and

01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:02,490
and that's that's very important and

01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:03,990
that doesn't always happen

01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,900
and it's very difficult to speak up when

01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:08,310
you know the business is on the line

01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:13,320
because something has got to be pushed

01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:15,920
out in time any more questions we got a

01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,920
couple minutes

01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:28,920
Thanks if you if you're someone who

01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:31,090
would like to help a fellow programmer

01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,770
go through the experience of debugging

01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,330
but they're not very vocal about it what

01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,920
are some of the tell-tale signs that we

01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,600
should look out for so that we're going

01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:46,840
to approach someone go you know you want

01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:51,370
to talk about this Thanks I don't know

01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:53,320
you know but all the signs that they're

01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:56,340
giving are the ones that tell you not to

01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,340
go and approach him fondly

01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:01,540
every time I see a cartoon about

01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:03,040
programmers there's somebody's draw you

01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,970
know a little cartoon it's about how

01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,700
much the programmers hate to be

01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:08,170
disturbed when they're working so

01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,370
programmers think that they're better

01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,600
off in this little world with their

01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:14,130
little mental models that they've

01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:15,910
carefully constructed for themselves

01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:20,920
we've got time for one more

01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:22,950
anybody know Thank You Daniella that was

01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,950
a

01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:35,390
that was a wonderful talk thank you very

01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:35,390
much for making the trip I'm proud of

01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,869
thanks your questions if anyone wants to

01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:44,250
talk to me about anything I've mentioned

01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:46,109
from piloting to Jango or deployment or

01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,710
Python in Africa come and talk to me

01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:48,710
