	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
this morning so a few years ago we had a

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,069
keynote at PyCon au in Brisbane where he

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,219
talked about the amazing new digital

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,170
curriculum that was going to be in

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:18,119
revolutionised but mostly modernized the

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,490
teaching of computing to school kids he

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,699
wasn't too positive about how that was

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,160
going at the time but we have had a huge

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,160
growth in efforts to improve kids

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,109
digital digital literacy and one of the

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,850
people the forefront of that is pip

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,559
Cleaves

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:44,850
please welcome pip to talk about those

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:47,460
future coders thank you just wait for

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,760
that to come through great Hey I'm pip

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,010
Cleaves and today I want to talk to you

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,780
about not so much what James Curran

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,969
spoke to you about dr. James when he was

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,399
here with you in Brisbane but the impact

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,260
of what he spoke to you about and what

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
that means to you guys as an industry

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,450
what that means to all our budding

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,310
coders in the universe so just to let

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,100
you know a little bit about me I'm the

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,170
national education manager at code club

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,259
Australia and usually I stand in front

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,330
of a room of educators today there's one

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,110
friendly face in the audience - thanks

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,630
very much and I work on the education

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,250
side code club Australia is a

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,720
not-for-profit organization that's

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,000
funded by the Telstra foundation

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,340
predominantly and we help teachers to

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,290
code we don't go in and give them the

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,180
injections and their immunizations to

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,340
tick the box to say that they're doing

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,470
coding in their school but we give

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,930
teachers the strategies and we give

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,970
students the resources so that they can

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,310
be awesome coders in your companies and

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,890
that's what drives us we're about social

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,110
impact we're not about making profit and

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,110
making things work we tend to hang out

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,229
in the hashtag get kids coding so you'll

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,420
find us there and I'm pip Cleaves on

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,960
Twitter so today what I want to talk to

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,310
you about is who are our users

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,200
what's our landscape at the moment like

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,119
what's actually happening what's the

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,830
languages that we work with the most

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,450
what are some of the gadgets and

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,210
physical computing that we're coming up

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,970
with

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,700
and what can you guys do as an industry

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,350
to help your future so the first thing I

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,830
want to dispel is this concept of

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,080
digital natives we all hear about this

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,570
that gets thrown through media every now

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,820
and then and I actually abhor this term

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,250
I don't believe that anyone is born

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,470
knowing how to do technology we all

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,260
learn technology as we go along we have

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,330
to be introduced to it and we have to be

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,150
given the tools so that we can then fly

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,490
it's the speed of that flying that is

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,000
different and a little while ago I came

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,030
across this beautiful piece in the TED

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,760
ideas and it speaks speaks about the

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,440
three types of users in the young

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,210
audience that we have around us at the

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,240
moment so when I walk into my classroom

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:04,420
or when I walk into university because I

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,250
lecture in digital technologies then I'm

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,330
going to have three types of users in

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,690
front of me and I have to work with

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,190
those guys now the first of those just

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,200
going to talk about those three to set

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,320
the scene the first of these guys are

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,870
the orphans and the orphans are given

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,940
the devices by mums and dads and they're

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,380
left to struggle on their own they're

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,290
given the iPads to keep them quiet

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,850
during dinner they're given the diet

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,280
devices and they find their way to

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:33,640
social media pretty quickly they find

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,980
their way to to survive and consume and

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,470
suck the life out of the internet and

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,780
troll and do it there they're not

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,190
they're not producers on the internet

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,290
they don't give back they just keep

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,680
sucking and they're they're orphans and

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,110
we need to be thinking about those guys

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,610
we then have the exiles and the exiles

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,770
are the guys at mums and dads are gonna

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,500
I don't want them touching this

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,960
technology until they're teenagers

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,030
so they pull it away from them

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,770
completely these guys don't have a

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,440
narrative to talk with their peers about

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,300
they're not gamers they're not they're

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,490
not building these computational

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,830
thinking skills they're not problem

00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,840
solvers they're scared of technology

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,790
when they step in front of it we have to

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,620
work with them they're in our classroom

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,470
and we have to be aware of them they're

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,090
sitting next to the orphans now

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,820
unfortunately when these guys jump on

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,290
board they go crazy they got no skills

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,930
they got no social

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,450
they don't know what to do so they're

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,640
pretty scary when they're online and

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,650
then our last crew and I'd say this is

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,320
you guys and every single child that you

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,180
work with is an air these are the guys

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,170
whose parents are working with them

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,560
they're specifically teaching them so I

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,570
have three children myself my 16 year

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,270
old unfortunately had the year that I

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,210
banned filters on Instagram and she had

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,610
to use Photoshop so now she knows how to

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,870
do these things so I'm hoping that yeah

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,120
yep

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,130
she hated me for a little while but now

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,070
she's doing graphic design and she loves

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,170
it because she was introduced and shown

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,970
opportunity so the heirs are the ones

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,060
that we're working with from an early

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,950
age every child shall be an heir every

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,360
student from kindergarten this is what

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,010
the new technologies curriculum is

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,640
telling us every student from

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,350
kindergarten should be an heir so a we

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,810
have to work with parents right that's

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,280
the scary bit second thing we're going

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,130
to with so let's keep in mind our

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,410
orphans our ears and our exiles if you

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,910
by the way I'm sharing this deck at the

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,430
end of the thing so you can jump on

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,170
board but that is from a blog TED ideas

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,040
and if I remember the name it's Alex

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,290
Samuels maybe so let's then move on to

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,090
we've got our users let's move on to the

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,650
landscape so dr. James spoke about this

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,540
new curriculum that was coming dr.

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,570
Curran let's actually talk about what it

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,640
is so the Australian National Curriculum

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,290
technologies syllabus is the official

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,760
language that you guys can forget about

00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,590
the minute you walk out of here time to

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,600
go with that and it's about creating

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,850
preferred futures through Design

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,370
Thinking and Technology stitute

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,590
solutions Eaton's not just about coding

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,280
and this is one of the most exciting

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,900
things I think as a teacher who's been

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,080
doing design thinking in my classroom

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,780
for a while this is absolutely fantastic

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,960
so our National Curriculum it says that

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,480
from f28 so kindergarten four year olds

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,200
through to 13 year olds 14 year olds

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,290
must learn coding must have a continuum

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,310
of coding must learn a whole heap of

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,590
things I'm going to talk about in a

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,000
second and they're new 9 and 10 if

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,790
you're thinking you're going to head

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,890
into that space the elective is for you

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,900
so all of a sudden we have students up

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,240
to the age of 14 doing some pretty

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,210
hardcore things so the curriculum itself

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,350
is split into two separate areas we have

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,840
bear with me

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,600
our digital technologies which is

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,930
looking at digital systems so this isn't

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,400
just this is the concept that to do

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,020
stuff we have to plug things into a

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,490
computer now bear with me if I get

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,030
really simple okay I'm the education

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,130
side not the techie side so we have to

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,780
plug things into a computer a tablets

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,310
not going to do everything and if we

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,320
think about our orphans that's really

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,910
important for them to understand then if

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,230
I want to grab a digital microscope and

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,610
I want to really zoom into something

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,620
then I've got to plug something in

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,700
somewhere yeah and it's about knowing

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,990
that if I want to take really good

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,180
photos I'm going to use a proper camera

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,880
for it we don't do everything on one

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,920
device so that's the digital systems the

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,230
representation of data so from

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,800
kindergarten we're looking at how do I

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,470
collect data how do I analyze data what

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,080
can I do with it in order to form some

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,540
decisions moving forward this is very

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,270
powerful coming year 9 and 10 and then

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,090
creating digital solutions is of course

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,100
that focus around coding process and

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,930
production skills hello

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,940
we're finally looking at project

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,280
management and we're looking at that

00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,960
from a very young age so the nuts and

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,210
bolts of this area the digital

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,160
technologies we'll look at data we're

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,170
looking at systems we're looking at

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,540
coding and we're looking at project

00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,220
management and the foundation for young

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,320
Australians put out a beautiful report

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,840
about a week ago about the skills we

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,250
need in 2030 and they really all of

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,590
these just get sucked into that

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,330
beautifully so I'm really excited by

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,430
this now I need to put a little bit of a

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,080
cursor on this at New South Wales is not

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,920
implementing at this stage all other

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,020
states are implementing strongly and New

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,810
South Wales is in a draft format through

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,710
our NASA Association we will get there

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:40,300
but not quite there at the moment so

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,650
just know if you are New South Wales

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,229
based it's a slightly different

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,690
discussion now the digital technology is

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,150
running parallel to that inside this big

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,820
curriculum is the design and Technology

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,380
space and this is a space where we help

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,810
kids to solve

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,930
two problems and we start moving into

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,030
things like sustainable food production

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:04,060
we start moving into machinery

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:06,730
production and engineering concepts so

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,770
this side takes a kind of the coding

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,650
kind of sets off to the side and we're

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,990
looking at solving problems using design

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,810
thinking to solve problems pulling aside

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,330
that project management to work through

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,760
so that we're helping students to think

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,160
that they not think to help them believe

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,920
that they can make an impact on the

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,290
future through using their technology to

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,930
do that that's the big concept that

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,050
we're working with and you'll see these

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,480
technologies context contexts down the

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,340
bottom I love engineering principles and

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,530
systems so they're going to look at

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,190
machines and the robotics that pops into

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,200
here right food and fiber production so

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,590
this has been labeled as something that

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,540
we need to work with imagine students

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,760
coming out of school with technology and

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,770
a knowledge in this space that's where

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,120
we innovate and that's where we move

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,980
forward as a nation food specializations

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,340
materials and technology specializations

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,860
so it's a very interesting area to think

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,230
that we're moving in those context areas

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,270
design thinking knowledge and

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,210
understanding and processes and

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,450
production skills they all come together

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:21,450
running parallel to our technologies to

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,860
give students a really good

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,870
understanding of how they can make an

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,080
impact and how they can be future

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,570
focused workplace people but what does

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,670
this actually mean at the various levels

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,440
so let's have a little bit of a look out

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,600
so in kindergarten what is all that

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,420
stuff me and what I'd actually do what

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,010
are the outcomes that we have to know so

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,230
I'm just going to run through what

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,730
students have to do at each level so by

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,530
the age of year two so that's like eight

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,560
students should be able to choose the

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,790
right system to suit the task at hand so

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,110
they should be able to know if I want to

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,390
take a photo I've got to go get a camera

00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,980
if I want to print a piece of paper I've

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,540
got to plug in a printer or not

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,850
necessary plug it in but I will use a

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,310
printer for that so they start that

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,329
understanding next step they're going to

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,290
use robotic

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:14,230
is to navigate a map yeah very basic

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,449
algorithms where we're going to say walk

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,509
forward three turn right

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,759
walk forward one turn left walk forward

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,730
to so we're starting to do things that

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:27,759
are like let's turn you know the Hungry

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:32,649
Hungry Caterpillar book yeah turn that

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:35,079
into a robotic map on the ground put the

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,749
fruit in order and the students have to

00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,399
create the map to go through that now

00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,110
you and I and everyone else knows this

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,529
works beautifully for English as well

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,410
right

00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,509
literacy being able to create procedures

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,129
and the flow of language and be able to

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,139
explain first we're going to go here and

00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,449
then I'm going to turn right so we start

00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:55,809
to see this computational thinking

00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:59,259
coming into the regular classroom coming

00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:01,389
into science English maths move forward

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:04,569
three steps turn right that sort of

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:08,139
stuff and then again creating simple

00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:10,540
algorithms for example identifying steps

00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,970
in a process or controlling robotic

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,790
devices now nowhere in here do we need

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,949
keyboards nowhere in here are we

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,480
actually talking about being on devices

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,189
we've got these great little things I've

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,699
shown a minute called be BOTS anyone

00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:26,199
seen a be BOTS little yellow ladybird

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,029
things that are about this big and

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,699
they've got arrows on the top of them

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:33,220
and they press the arrows for the number

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:36,399
of squares forward and then they press

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,139
play and it doesn't it's really cute so

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,299
from an early age we can do these

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:43,569
robotics and we don't need devices for

00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:45,699
everything that's up until you - so

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:49,179
there are little mini coders and they're

00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:51,519
very very happy excitable people in year

00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:52,629
three and four I like to call them our

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,519
energizer bunnies

00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:57,819
so you anyone got a year three or four

00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,309
student around them eight nine year old

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,470
yeah these guys are really inquisitive

00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:03,669
right they want to learn stuff they want

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,189
to get in yeah

00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:07,959
so without energizer bunnies as I like

00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,689
to call them these guys are all about

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,360
introducing coding to them starting to

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:14,919
get them hands on a keyboard starting to

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,289
get them thinking about things they can

00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,980
do so they're going to be following

00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:21,310
algorithm x' and creating branching so

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,680
they're going to

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,910
start moving into if and then we're

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,760
going to work on project management

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,490
hello a seven-year-old thinking right oh

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,770
I've been given a pretty big problem to

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,470
solve the first thing I need to do is go

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,730
and do some research and then I'm going

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,250
to try and think of a whole heap of

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,740
solutions and then I'm going to test out

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,540
a few and then I'm going to pick the

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,910
best one and then I'm going to share it

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,900
with my community so all of a sudden of

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,240
course the teachers are going to

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,740
scaffold this like nothing else there's

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,630
going to be lots of steps and lots of

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,310
you know do these do this do this but

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,279
they're starting to understand big

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,020
problem this is what I do they're going

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,760
to use things like digital microscopes

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,430
one of my best buddies shout out to

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,600
Mitch he his kids come flying in from

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,850
recess every day and they've got like

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,620
insects and they like pull the legs off

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,960
the insect and they chuck it under the

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,850
digital microscope and they like get in

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,200
there and they check it out and they all

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,940
come in on the weekends with all their

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,930
bugs to put under the microscope and

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,820
it's about one of those ones that just

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,830
like USB plugs into his computer and

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,089
they just hone in and then they talk

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,860
about it and they get really deep into

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,330
the science part of it and I think

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,430
that's really cool because the students

00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,440
are seeing technology is not just this

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,470
this thing but lots of stuff coming

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,210
together to give me understanding using

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,580
robotic toys again to navigate a map

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,380
we've been there we're doing it again

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,750
designing solutions using visual coding

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,790
languages so this is the beginning of

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,089
the scratches of the world of the block

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,980
layers of the of the I like to call them

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,350
and again remember me I'm kind of simple

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,800
in this face it's the cake the cake mix

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,050
boxes of coding yeah so I like to say

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,720
it's the two people I explained it so so

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,810
our visual coding is our cake mix that

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,490
we buy from the supermarket and Python

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,900
coding of the world is that the way that

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,370
grandma used to bake a cake and

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,680
everything from base and everything from

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,000
scratch so that's the way I describe to

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,550
teachers who are all very new to this

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,890
space right all very very new so we have

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,870
to bring them in nice and gently and so

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,110
the visual coding in the world so

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,120
scratch is a big one of course block

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,279
coding any there's 50 million of those

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,470
out there I'll show a few in a minute

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,170
kind of the main area yeah and of course

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,850
the Minecrafts of the world and then

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,280
they're going to be collecting

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,020
manipulating and interpreting data so by

00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,430
the end of you for students

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,040
you know really well how to set up a

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,070
survey how to understand how to collect

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,650
that data to look at and creating graphs

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,750
from that data and starting to pull

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,390
information out of it and I think that's

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,390
really important working in your space

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,150
yeah data is big yeah to begin to walk

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,750
understand that early on is important

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,340
year five and six is is kind of similar

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,160
in the coding space the way I've got it

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,050
in my head is that by the end of u6 a

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,450
student if you said come on let's jump

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,000
in a scratch though no I am so over

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,980
scratched I am not doing it again I've

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,660
got this visual coding done go away

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,630
leave me alone I want to do the next bit

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,390
so that to me is our benchmark for the

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:23,470
end of primary school so we're also

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,600
talking UX design to them so we have to

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,280
talk it to educators as well and we have

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,500
to work in that space and use the

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,090
language that you guys use we have to

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,280
talk prototyping we have to do

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,560
prototyping more and more schools are

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,050
creating little makerspace zones where

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,640
teachers will take their students when

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,460
they're doing some rapid prototyping

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,810
when they're thinking about this space

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,510
collaborative project management so

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,520
we're moving from students doing project

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,970
management on their own and being

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,640
scaffolded to working in a team so last

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,370
year I'm actually a Japanese teacher is

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,560
my basic teaching area and I was in the

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,850
classroom for two years China checking

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,240
that my head space around this

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,520
technology is what's actually real and

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,740
and I might write guys you're going to

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,709
create we're going to 3d print some

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,000
pokemons and then you're going to create

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,140
stop-motion animation with a Pokemon

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,820
battle and we're going to choose which

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,230
is the best Pokemon and we're going to

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,400
share it at assembly art you're going to

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,990
do that in Japanese okay no props and I

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,820
thought that was pretty weak in terms of

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,620
a hook to get them in there but they did

00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,209
they really got in there now that's not

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,100
coding but the collaborative project

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,990
management I was woefully

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,490
I'm sitting back and I'm watching them

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,380
I've given them all the tools they need

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,300
I've given them scaffolds for their

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,110
planning and they're working together a

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:45,010
week out from deadlines Me's so it's got

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,720
the file at home I'm like and you didn't

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,820
plan for the cloud you don't have access

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,820
to any cloud well yeah

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,440
well come on so they really don't know

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,170
how to work well together they don't how

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,210
to use tools to work well together we

00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,710
have to help them do that we have to

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,590
help them build those skills because you

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,120
guys know how important they are right

00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,700
they should be able to create really

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,310
good games and quizzes and interactive

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,940
stories and animations and they should

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:15,330
be really confident in this space for me

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,560
the last ones a little bit of a

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,570
beautiful bugbear something that I'm

00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,160
very passionate about is that students

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,650
should be able to use productivity suite

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,660
software really well they should know

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,390
and don't laugh at me how to insert an

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,690
image into a OneNote file without having

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:34,690
to look it up on YouTube yeah it's not

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,000
necessarily the case we have to give

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,800
them we have to expose them and teach

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,200
them how to use a productivity suite

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,510
stuff so that they can focus on the the

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,330
deeper technology later on right it's

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,930
not about word processing that's just a

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,840
skill that's just something in life and

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:55,900
we but we have to teach them we're not

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,790
digital natives no one is remember back

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,560
to those three types so that's your

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,230
sixth sense so that's up to you six

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,810
right so by the end of primary school

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,230
this is where our let's move on to high

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:10,000
school so in high school we're looking

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,670
at generous general purpose programming

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,980
so we're looking at the html's and the

00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:18,670
pythons and the the space that scares me

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,000
considerably we're looking at UX and

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,500
accessibility and design accessibility

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,240
imagine kids thinking about

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,270
accessibility when they're designing

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,890
products for their future

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,910
we know that's a really exciting space

00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,960
to be part of increasingly complex

00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,320
algorithms that allow data to be

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,880
manipulated automatically this is year

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,860
seven and eight this is still mandatory

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,420
so out sloth-like sorry you twelve year

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,040
olds and thirteen year olds that are

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,030
just you know getting through life and

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,090
chilling yeah

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,100
all of a sudden they're in there in

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,310
general-purpose programming with

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,380
increasing with automatic data

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,000
manipulation they're decomposing

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,900
problems they're creating interactive

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,270
apps

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,670
animations and solutions and their

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,520
acquiring and analyzing and evaluating

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,830
data they should be quite strong in this

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,880
space by now so an example project of a

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,610
year 7 & 8 is that they might create a a

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,150
game for their peers that teaches them

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:24,640
about some aspect of life so I might get

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,930
my Japanese students to create a game to

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,660
teach each other how to learn Japanese

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,460
and they would have to do that in a

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,790
general-purpose programming because

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,050
remember we don't talk scratching u7

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,030
it's going to take a few years to get

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,980
there I think I think if we were to

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,020
chuck this on your server now hmm we'd

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,420
lose them there'd be like anarchy in the

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,730
classroom we've got to bring them up to

00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,350
this and get them ready for it so that's

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,880
the sort of stuff we're looking at so

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,280
these guys are kind of starting to get

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,050
really bored with life we have to bored

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,790
with school life we have to make it

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:59,500
interesting then we get to year 9 and 10

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,910
now I'll be really honest and say these

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,530
probably doesn't make a lot of sense to

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,690
me but I'm sure it makes a lot of sense

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:09,130
to you guys so this is an example

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:10,960
project of an elective year 9 and 10 so

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,390
the big box at the top is the project

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,830
and the little skinny bits underneath it

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,360
are the outcomes that they're going to

00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,370
be marked on so they're going to have to

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,990
be able to do these things so students

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,930
are going to use a markup language and

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,780
style sheets to design and create a

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,180
prototype data-driven Weber to solve an

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,920
identified problem for example and apt

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,190
to locate the best surfing spots in

00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,190
Queensland I think that's pretty

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,740
exciting so if you guys can do that by

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,150
the age of 16 because that's what

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,640
they'll be when they finish this that's

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,830
pretty cool right yeah and these guys

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,690
then come out and do work experience or

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,220
they go to uni and they come in sit as

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,140
interns in your offices that's pretty

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,660
helpful yeah that they can do these

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,430
things I think so they need to in order

00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,100
to do that they have to analyze client

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,470
needs very it's very sophisticated

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,780
language right it's very much project

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,670
brief language as I see it I'm designing

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,790
complex algorithms with modular

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:09,130
functions evaluating the data-driven web

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,320
app solution against the specified

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,350
criteria to ensure it meets stakeholder

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,399
needs that's cool establishing protocols

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,940
for the system

00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:20,769
ability of knowledge vases and planning

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,019
and managing using software development

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,899
cycle theories so compared to what they

00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:28,479
do now this is next level compared to

00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,830
what is mandatory now for a student in

00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:32,619
you nine and ten doing software

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,859
development and design in New South

00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:38,259
Wales this is complete next level in

00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:40,239
order to do this we need from

00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:42,879
kindergarten to get them ready for it

00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:44,950
and it may not be every student in the

00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:46,239
school that wants to do these things but

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,369
we have to give every student the

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:52,929
opportunity to do these things and

00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:54,460
that's what drives me so if we look at

00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:56,979
all those projects and what I was

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,950
speaking about to me what it all really

00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:02,440
means is that we should be learning

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,109
through projects not learning through

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,899
computer science not learning through

00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:10,330
step by step tick boxes and move through

00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:12,369
some sort of online interface but we

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,330
should be giving them big chunky

00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:18,669
projects that exist in the world today

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:21,279
hooking them in with you guys as mentors

00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:23,589
in those projects in schools in order

00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,379
that they think wow I'm actually doing

00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,389
something real I'm not just clicking the

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,279
buttons on a keyboard here I'm doing

00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,039
something that actually makes an impact

00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,239
on the community around me and that

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,710
community maybe just something in their

00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:38,080
classroom they might make an app for

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,330
making the roll in their classroom or it

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,849
may be something bigger solving an

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,009
Australian issue and taking part in in

00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:46,450
some sort of a bigger project so I think

00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:48,609
it's really important that we need to

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,769
remember this as society we're not

00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:52,539
learning the old way tick next level

00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:54,070
tick next level we're now learning

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,649
through projects and we're learning

00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,179
through doing stuff and I call to you

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:01,029
guys to do that now I want to show you

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:03,339
an example of what this looks like so I

00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:07,139
had a student last year oh this is gonna

00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:12,359
look really bad hmm we give it a go yes

00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:16,570
so he entered a competition called the

00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:19,149
AC er video game challenge Australian

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,999
College of educational research I think

00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,429
it is anyway and he won so student in

00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:28,389
year eight made this pixel tanks game

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,700
using Python if someone really knows how

00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:30,680
to

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,210
me out here say this year I can't make

00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,600
it like fit to the screen properly

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,160
because like a 13 year old so let me

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,630
just press play here and see how we go

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,460
see how how much of the screen we can

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:51,260
see oh we're not going to see a huge

00:24:40,460 --> 00:25:02,180
amount okay hmm let's go one here we go

00:24:51,260 --> 00:25:07,490
okay one that one goes there yeah so now

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,880
I need two little it's not going let me

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,120
do it

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,860
Oh such a shame maybe I'll do it I'll

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,110
sort something a little bit later okay

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,500
let's just leave it there for that it's

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,860
what I want to I want to show you pixel

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,170
tanks give me a second maybe then I can

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,550
sort it yeah sorry about that and if

00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,620
anyone out there knows how to solve that

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:29,000
for me while I'm standing up here with

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,590
my presentation brain on there to be

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,110
great

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,510
alright so back to a project so that boy

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,070
he he was one of those quiet kids in the

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,650
classroom I'm sure you all know them or

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,570
you've been one set up the back I didn't

00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,980
really know that he had the skills and

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,780
he can't just go under and go save me so

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,060
one I'm like what you wind the max thing

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,620
cos I won that ASA thing you told me to

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,660
do no what do you mean you won that ASA

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,250
thing I told you my dad and I we worked

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,270
through it and like I said me too my

00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,100
portfolio and everything and I went and

00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,930
he did this whole portfolio with his

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,120
whole process he went through to create

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,530
the game and he won and I just think

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,600
that is awesome and he was so engaged

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,370
after that and we need to do more of

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,620
that this is that actual challenge if

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,590
you do know any people in your community

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:14,870
as you can see it's good they they get

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,820
there in that dev stage at the moment so

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,890
if you do know anyone doing this

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,440
competition lend them your knowledge

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,240
lend them your your expertise and help

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,300
them through with it it's just the ACE

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,190
our video stem or Australian stem video

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,350
game Chuck just make a video game yeah

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,290
yeah basically that's what it's all

00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,390
about so I think that's the world we

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,740
need to be working in now I've been

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,090
alluding to but let's look at the

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,090
different languages that students learn

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,830
in the continuum of coding languages

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,870
that we go through

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,070
and I'm gonna go quick here so let's

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,470
yeah

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,360
kindergarten you to you three scratch

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,710
jr. is an apple on iPads which is really

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,540
cool you don't need any language for

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,890
this it's just a drag-and-drop thing you

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,690
don't need to door you can type stuff

00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,010
you don't need to it's a really nice one

00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,960
to use I recommend if you've got some

00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,100
young people's around Chuck the app on

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,290
and do it

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,560
block Lee we've got scratch from you

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,970
three to four five to six now scratch

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,000
three will be coming out soon which is a

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,320
nice html5 that'll work on iPads and for

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,940
all those schools that have iPads out

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,190
there they'll be able to use them for

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,980
this sort of stuff and Swift is an

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,290
increasingly popular Swift playgrounds

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,680
app is increasingly popular in schools

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:27,320
at the moment it's an iOS app and it is

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,540
starting to bring in physical computing

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,010
inside that environment which makes it

00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,710
nice so some of the different websites

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,540
that we use around the place is the make

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,610
code actually the main code website I

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,380
like make code because see here this

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,420
minecraft let me just quickly show you

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,130
this so you've got its block coding

00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,650
microbead is actually probably my

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,300
favorite little physical computing tool

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,010
at the moment they're absolutely

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,540
fantastic and really cool and really

00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:58,940
cheap and really accessible for schools

00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,980
thank you this has anyone seen this

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,710
before no okay

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,020
so yeah you've seen it so it minecraft

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,300
now has an education edition which means

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,190
as a teacher when I open and it works

00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,320
your office 365 environment so you kids

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,600
just need office 365 they log in with

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,610
that I log in with that a server

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,620
automatically start when I shut down my

00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,510
computer the server shuts down perfect

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,280
right for a teacher yeah really cool I

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,670
can freeze kids and do all that sort of

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,890
stuff

00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:27,680
do Hickory really quickly but I can also

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,510
do coding so this is block coding so if

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,220
I choose my run option here and I've

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,580
turned on the little there's a code

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:38,210
connector extension then my code will

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,580
run in minecraft so I all of a sudden my

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,920
block code is moving into that well for

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,630
some students that are moving more into

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,020
that space we've got the JavaScript

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:50,450
option here so we can flip them over

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,700
start introducing JavaScript start

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,890
showing them that it's not just about

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,549
cake mix as Vaio's is actually you know

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,429
a base

00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:59,600
to this and show them that world but if

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,039
kids are about blocks they're about

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,730
blocks who cares it's about coding right

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,759
so that's a really cool space to be in

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:09,320
I'm very very very liked so it's kind of

00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,759
taking it to the next level so that make

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,559
code space keep an eye on that if you

00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,809
want some cool activities to do at home

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,989
and then of course you've got this sort

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:21,169
of girls spin the make code area your

00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:23,779
tinkerer space and code.org which has

00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:26,360
some nice activities scratch jr. and

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:28,340
codable which is the app on the right

00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,249
hand side so from the top scratch on the

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,340
top left codable so very that first

00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:36,859
level of maps basic algorithms move

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,049
forward three tune writes down to

00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:42,909
light-bot which is down on the bottom

00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:44,269
left-hand side I'm stuck at like level 5

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:46,879
yeah

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,109
don't talk to many people that and then

00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:50,809
that bottom one down there is called the

00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:52,639
Foos I don't know about the foods is

00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,200
cool it's getting people along croc

00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:56,239
learning also have some great activities

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,759
but remember at this stage it's about

00:29:56,239 --> 00:30:00,649
introduction scratch is a fantastic

00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,289
space so really enjoy scratch and I like

00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:06,529
the openness of it and then ask Swift

00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:08,989
playgrounds which is available on iOS at

00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:11,659
the moment when we head into year our

00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:15,049
older years we can start playing in HTML

00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:16,850
and Python for our for our extension

00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:20,389
kids at the end of primary school yeah

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,489
and then 7 & 8 9 and 10 for those really

00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:24,019
eager ones we can head into Ruby so some

00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,480
of those these are things that teachers

00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:28,970
use yeah we have Mozilla thimbles got a

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,489
really nice environment for kids to get

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,609
used to using HTML got some little

00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:37,519
projects there that are really cool then

00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:39,529
we've got pen G which is a nice Python

00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,230
introduction work students through that

00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:46,249
and our getting started with minecraft

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:48,769
Pais so code Club is a Raspberry Pi

00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:49,999
organization or our parent company so

00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,859
I'm actually heading over to Raspberry

00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:55,909
Pi at the end of this month in England

00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:57,710
I'm very excited sorry um so we've got

00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,999
some activities around getting started

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,440
with Minecraft pi

00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:02,749
I'll show you through our code Club

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,359
stuff very quickly in a second so these

00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:07,399
are these projects we have here have all

00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,530
the steps every student needs to get

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,350
through and get started with crazy

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,570
their own Minecraft on their little

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,010
raspberry pies and raspberry pies are

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,870
great for schools because we all know

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,740
how cheap they are and they're really

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,900
good at I'll just quickly head into the

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,560
next space and explain why I think that

00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,590
in a second

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:31,070
so at code Club we cover all these code

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,200
languages as well so we have about a

00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,300
hundred and twenty hours of resources

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,520
that are open source and therefore

00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,530
anyone in the world to use without any

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,810
sort of signing or firewall that's

00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,420
necessary so these are our coding

00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:46,340
languages we focus on so we have scratch

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,730
and we say let's do that for about six

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,640
months and then let's head into HTML and

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,020
then and our projects look a little bit

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,050
like this so whenever you go to our

00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:00,140
project page so let's head into say

00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,900
mystery letter for an HTML project you

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,780
open the project and we have what the

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,020
end result is going to be and then a

00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,510
step-by-step of what you need to do to

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,070
get started so a teacher can feel really

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,080
confident that everything a student

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,480
needs is there that they can work with

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,360
each other to do that and for the

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,100
teacher what's really cool is that the

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,540
fully worked solution is there for them

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:29,330
as well so if they don't have the if

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,260
they don't have the full confidence then

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:36,440
they can copy across remix across the

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,230
solution we we use trinket as our editor

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,360
for Python and HTML and they can remix

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,590
that and then they can open it up and

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,600
just say kids well you know you guys

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,280
problem-solve together you work together

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,930
to work out the solution to here what's

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:52,190
different between yours and this one

00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:55,240
working through so these resources let

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,800
me just go back there based we have a

00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,380
group in the UK and we have a github

00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,480
environment and anyone can create and

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,610
add to these spaces which is really

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,100
exciting so in terms of our Python

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:12,230
activities we have here and these are

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,420
you can see quickly here starting off

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,700
with an about me page papers rock

00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,860
scissors game a turtle race we're

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:22,220
heading into a team chooser secret

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,310
messages modern art and RPG games so

00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,340
straight away

00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,690
we're heading into really cool projects

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm just gonna open that for it in a

00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,900
second

00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,610
so KOCO we're there to help teachers I

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,320
run training for teachers to get them

00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,390
moving

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,980
that's the coding then I always say it's

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,960
important to take the coding and do

00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,610
something with it so these are the

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,380
little be bots I was talking about down

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,420
in the bottom left-hand side these are

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,250
the gadgets so in the early age the

00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,620
gadgets are beautiful and they're shiny

00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:54,050
shiny and you know they're nice and

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:58,740
consume our focused very block coding

00:33:54,050 --> 00:34:00,480
focused so bebot is one of those - is a

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,000
lovely that's the three sort of the blue

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,040
one and - you can code using a block

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,960
coding system or you can just drive it

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,150
round like the Sphero like a remote car

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,429
to get kind of used to that controlling

00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,770
and then start doing blocks so it works

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,450
its way around the Lego we do is very

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,240
popular as is the ozobot

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:20,700
you can draw the code and then he's seen

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,840
the ozobot before like these little

00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,520
things they're about this big right if

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,310
you can buy one for friends do it and

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,200
you get pens like any sort of tech stuff

00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,540
doesn't matter what sort and depending

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,899
on your color combination of red green

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,580
and blue it does different things so

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,480
you're kind of drawing the code right

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,520
and then it has a whole online interface

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,370
so it's got a block coding system you

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,080
block code right and then you hold the

00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,030
ozobot onto the screen and press

00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,490
download and it flushes like a crazy

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,929
person and puts the code onto the ozobot

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:54,690
and then you put on the table and it

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:56,280
does it so it's really cool and they're

00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,560
very they're like you know you can get

00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,780
that they're quite cheap to purchase as

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,880
well the little wood block this is

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,780
actually it's in the media at the moment

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,300
this is called a cubetto

00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,340
and it is for early learners so let's

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,990
say pre-kindergarten even and what you

00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,300
do with the block is you put the codes

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,520
on the block on that the the square

00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,080
board and you put the cube it over the

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,300
top and he rolls over the top of it and

00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,750
remembers that code then you put him on

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,730
the ground and he does the code and down

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,830
the bottom of that board can you see

00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,130
maybe not the last row is actually a

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,870
loop so they learn looping while they're

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,340
playing with this stuff and they're

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,620
really cool if you've got babies around

00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,960
you get one of them for them yet they're

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,830
really cool moving into

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,990
the gadgets for the let's say five and

00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:46,200
six upwards so three and four lots of

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:48,390
coding five and six building that coding

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,800
and adding more gadgets on to it let's

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,660
start hanging out with the makey makers

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,910
of the world let's start playing with

00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,580
the micro bits they're really cool the

00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,589
end box which is a nice I like the end

00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,900
bot these are still got block coding

00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,849
background or often they have a Python

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,339
option that you can work with the

00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,900
raspberry PI's and lately I've fallen a

00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:10,140
little bit in love with the Cano area

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,420
which is a really nice space 5 10 10 5

00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,480
good excellent well I'm going really

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,830
fast and beautiful so these are some of

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,470
the gadgets that we're starting to use

00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,750
in school so I would think that by high

00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:25,800
school that we're really comfortable

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:28,230
with coding different gadgets raspberry

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,050
PI's something that's maybe the higher

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,339
level I don't believe it's every child

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,570
but I believe where there are some

00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,580
students that are going through that

00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,580
elective strand who should be moving in

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,910
this space so what do I need you guys

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,380
then to do if we're working on this we

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,910
want our students to be solving the

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,010
problems in the world that we all live

00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,410
in and we're giving them the skills from

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,060
kindergarten to get there then I believe

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,950
and the teachers we haven't lived in

00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,680
this space because I've said 50 times

00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,570
I'm not one of you guys I'm an educator

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,599
person who has a real passion in this

00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:03,210
space then we need you to help us in

00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,339
schools to make it all happen and the

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,980
ways you can do that is that code club

00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,750
first one we get volunteers to match

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,630
with school so for schools doing a code

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,130
club in the afternoons and we try and

00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,170
get a volunteer to come and help that

00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,940
teacher or if libraries look at the

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,780
libraries around you they often have

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:24,359
code clubs or coder dojos you volunteer

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,280
your time to help them mentor some of

00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,380
the future coders see reach out to a

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,440
school and see if they're doing you nine

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:33,750
and ten elective courses can you mentor

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,180
those kids in some way you know you can

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,890
do this via online chatting and stuff

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,730
you can you don't have to be there all

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:43,170
the time but to connect yourselves to

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,810
those kids who are sitting in that

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:48,000
Square classroom with square lines of

00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,830
desks not really realizing what the

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,030
world's like out there they need to

00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,010
connect with you guys

00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,200
makes them the other thing we need you

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,200
to do is to make some really fun

00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,780
projects for us when we've going from

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,520
the scratches and the scratched juniors

00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,580
and the block coating there's so many

00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,260
cool bling projects there right and they

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,990
all look really fun and they're really

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,870
colorful and they're really kind of yeah

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:15,480
cool we need some nice cool Python

00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:18,180
projects too to keep that continuum so

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,100
if you can make some of those and share

00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,200
those with your community and share them

00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,600
that's a great thing that you can do to

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,030
help teachers to keep that engagement

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,160
level happening and then donate some

00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,860
resources donate the micro bits tonight

00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,750
donate things to schools to help the

00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,210
teachers to do this or to clubs or to

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,640
libraries or to the universe around you

00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,590
use your social impact area within your

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,110
company and that need to work in that

00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,910
volunteer space so tell so for example

00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:48,900
on Monday I'm going back to train some

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,970
Telstra guys Telstra donate they have a

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,450
day a year I think so if I get this

00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,680
wrong where people do volunteer day and

00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,620
they get paid for it within the

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,930
companies set up social impact time area

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,030
so we often have Telstra volunteers come

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,880
to our events and stands and stuff which

00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,470
is really fun and this may be a good

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,070
place this may be a good thing for you

00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:14,190
to whet your appetite on we are

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:16,620
currently at code club on a mission to

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:19,620
break a world record last year we had

00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:23,040
10,000 kids coding in one day and this

00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:26,130
year we've already got 20,000 students

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,340
kids registered to do our moon hack

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:32,180
challenge and our moon hat challenge is

00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:35,190
it's a global challenge this year and

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,900
we've got three projects there we've got

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,780
a scratch jr. a scratch and a Python

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,600
project and we've got other ideas for

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,340
people just to do to get kids coding to

00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,950
show them to give them a little bit of

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,600
an open up so you may like to offer to

00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,720
help at a school or run a moon hack

00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,550
session with kids in your your company

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,340
after school that day or do something

00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,500
jump in there and tell people about our

00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,750
moon hack challenge that we have at the

00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,730
moment I'm really excited by it I would

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,390
love to think that we we get up to a

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,779
really high level

00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:09,730
I don't know if we will and so the last

00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:12,990
thing I asked you to do is to help us

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:15,700
with our code club resources in our

00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,980
Python area we have as I mentioned we

00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,930
have a git github environment and we're

00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,420
always after people to help us build our

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,269
resources so if you are interested just

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,859
jump on to code club and follow the

00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:29,980
trail from there or contact me on

00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:33,549
Twitter and I can help you with that so

00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,950
I think as we're getting towards the end

00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:38,500
there might be some questions around for

00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:42,700
people if you would like to ask me any

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:45,039
questions about coding so I'm calling

00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,710
you guys to come and help us teach us to

00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:51,610
get your future workforce ready to walk

00:40:47,710 --> 00:41:00,219
into your companies and do good stuff

00:40:51,610 --> 00:41:00,219
[Applause]

00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:07,670
we we do have a few minutes if you have

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:09,710
a question I have a question I don't

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,900
need a microphone just over here if you

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,030
could or there's one here as well if you

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,610
could define the microphone I'm just

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:21,320
curious how much you've talked to folks

00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:24,140
in say the sciences who do a lot of data

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,870
work about how this is all feeding into

00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:31,580
them yeah so we've all heard the word

00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:33,890
stem a lot at the moment my belief is

00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,560
actually that every subject should have

00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,320
technology in it and that science should

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,210
be really focusing in this space so in a

00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,850
way the new digital technologies

00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,920
curriculum mandates that science is

00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,820
hooked in there as well and it opens up

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,140
an opportunity to focus in that space so

00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:57,640
teachers just in general it's part of

00:41:51,140 --> 00:42:01,280
the narrative yeah one of the things

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,400
that I noticed a couple of times in that

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,870
presentation is the increasing number of

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,540
I guess mega companies that I haven't

00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,710
seen before is that something that we

00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,320
should be worried about them trying to

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:24,370
do what I guess one in particular has

00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:24,370
done with IT education in the past I

00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:31,280
believe it and I know this is a cliche

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,390
but it takes a village to raise a child

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,250
so everybody so we have our big

00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,530
companies and they're doing good things

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,750
but we also need the small companies to

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,420
follow in from there and show

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:47,150
opportunity so we don't just think it's

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,370
one or two options that students know

00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,280
and I think the new technologies

00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:55,100
curriculum the fact that he knew seven

00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:59,060
and eight it's mandatory for every

00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:03,110
student in Australia in a few years to

00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:05,240
learn a base coding language so that's

00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,570
really good right that's going to keep

00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,820
us thinking outside just a narrow field

00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,820
of options does that make sense

00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,970
I think it's in the right space moving

00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:21,800
forward to keep people broad and keep

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:23,660
people looking around the place thank

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,480
you for the talk so it seems like

00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,160
there's potential here to reach beyond

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,380
just the traditional startup tech

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,480
industry and push project engine skills

00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,290
that have come out of that area into

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,570
large traditional firms what do you see

00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,060
as being critical to actually getting

00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,310
that on-ramp connected so that the new

00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,600
generation kind of is arter these skills

00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,760
and doesn't just crash headlong into

00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,320
people who are 50 and think that

00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,090
waterfall is still good way of doing

00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:55,040
things and that there's no place for a

00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:57,260
new technology I think confidence from

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,630
young children so that that young young

00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,640
work people from the work place so they

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,200
come to you guys and they've got this

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,670
confidence that they know what to do

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,800
when they're doing a project or they

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,110
know that data is important or they've

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,220
got some skills under their belt so then

00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:15,260
they're ready to kind of fight the fight

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,120
the gates in front of me with them if

00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,500
that makes sense if they're I know what

00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,210
I'm doing and they got a little not too

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,720
much of course that's a struggle to

00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:26,210
write by they know and they've got

00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,520
confidence to say no we know we can do

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,840
this we're right and not just go yeah I

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,910
don't know anything I better do it the

00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,380
way that it's always been done yet so I

00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,380
think that's really important for us

00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:43,430
thanks very much for that and I'm really

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,860
interested to see all these different

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:48,950
devices and different opportunities ways

00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:51,110
of getting kids interested from a really

00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:55,040
young age but the thing that struck me

00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:58,190
was it felt like a lot of the things the

00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,070
ideas you're talking about and the ways

00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:04,820
that kids would get interested in apply

00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:07,310
a lot to your ears yes that you talked

00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,590
about I guess what I'm interested in is

00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:12,620
what's your experience with the orphans

00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:14,000
and the exiled dealing getting

00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,760
interested because if they're not

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,960
interested yeah then they fall behind

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,390
absolutely how do you sort of catch that

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,690
so I actually think in going back to

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,920
those bling sites going back to those

00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,800
majors

00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,780
they're gonna pull the orphans and the

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,780
exiles in because they set up for

00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,030
instant success they set up to look good

00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,160
they set up to connect with the social

00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,440
space so if we think of those orphans

00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,960
and exiles who come late they jump on

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,300
board they consume things then by

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,740
getting into the different big platforms

00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,540
that have got their block codes let's

00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,640
talk about the made with code sight for

00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,160
example I've seen girls that have no

00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,080
confidence whatsoever that are exiles

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,849
but they want to see what this is about

00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,950
coming and they make stuff within ten

00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:00,590
minutes and they're like wow I can do

00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:03,290
this and that builds that intrinsic

00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:05,119
motivation to move forward and it gives

00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,859
them a little bit of an extrinsic tick

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,050
the box and keep moving forward

00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:11,960
so I think they're really important

00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,340
while the airs they do that in two

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,140
seconds and move on to the next thing

00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,940
right and they're already into the

00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,609
physical computing and they're they're

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,760
making the projects then these guys are

00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:24,440
building their confidence through those

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,740
larger platforms that are out there does

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,740
that make sense

00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,240
we have so thank you again

00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,360
now they're all the stickers get these

00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,649
protects just

00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,649
