coming back for our final talk of the

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,240
day it's my pleasure to introduce Josh

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,309
Simmons Josh describes himself as a

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,010
recovering web developer and open-source

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,900
advocate with a penchant for armchair

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,490
philosophy who's spoken at conferences

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,970
around the world on community open

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:22,380
source and web technology so he's now a

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,390
member of the Google open source

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,099
outreach team where he manages the

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,000
Google open source blog and automates

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,470
all the things he's also a volunteer

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,450
chief financial officer and board member

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,010
for the open source initiative and he's

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,140
here to speak about it speak to us about

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:43,739
getting students into free and open

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:46,020
source software thank you for the

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,309
introduction and thank you all for

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,800
sticking around

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,750
I realize it's probably been a long day

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,829
your brains are probably quite full at

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,690
this point so I will make this as fast

00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,120
useful and painless as possible and

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,680
please forgive me if I'm a bit nervous I

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,470
was never a good student so being around

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,000
educators so yes my name is Josh I'm

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,790
with the Google open source outreach

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,729
team and part of what I'm here to talk

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,710
to you about today is Google's student

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,720
programs for getting students into free

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,369
and open source software but bigger than

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,700
that what other resources are there for

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,270
getting students to learn by

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,180
contributing to open source software so

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:33,119
I will briefly talk about why I will

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,829
discuss Google student programs I will

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
acknowledge an elephant in the room and

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,909
I'll explain that later and then I'll

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,090
spend the rest of the talk talking

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,850
covering a host of other resources but

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,799
first a little housekeeping I've planned

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,409
for questions at the end so as they come

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
up please write them down we'll see how

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,100
many questions we get to if you have

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,290
questions that we don't answer that I'm

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,509
not able to answer on the moment or

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,600
questions that come up later feel free

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,380
to tweet at me you know me find me

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,549
around the conference if you're

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,030
happening just if you happen to stick

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,450
around and to be clear I've worn many

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,080
hats

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,120
I still wear quite a few today right now

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
I'm wearing the Hat of the individual

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Joshua Simmons

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
Foss advocate that's to say my opinions

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,430
don't represent my employer's past

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,409
present future though it is very

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,069
relevant what I'm saying is very

00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:29,349
relevant to my work and lastly my slides

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:33,159
won't be available afterwards you're not

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:36,879
missing out the video certainly will be

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,750
available and I will be tweeting all of

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,769
the links on the teaching Foss hashtag

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,420
unpure a couple of them have already

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,859
gone out so they're pretty scheduled you

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,650
don't have to be a Twitter user to be

00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:52,030
able to search and find those links so

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,680
enough preamble let's dive in why should

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,689
students contribute to free and open

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,909
source software why is it a valuable

00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:00,489
experience for them I'll tell you what

00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:04,659
we at Google say and then I will tell

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:07,629
you what students say first they get

00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,329
real-world experience they work on teams

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,540
they communicate with people across time

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,030
zones and cultures communicate across

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,280
different mediums they have to learn

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,720
testing they have to ship tests with a

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,849
software they build they have to use

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,239
version control therefore all the

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,470
students that are out there that may be

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,669
fiddling around with code or building

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,680
things it's not often that they actually

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,799
do a proper development workflow and so

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,970
working with Foss is a way to get them

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,379
ramped up on these tools that are

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,659
critical when they get into industry

00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,970
they create visible work artifacts which

00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:49,900
is to say when a student contributes to

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,459
Foss there is code in the open because

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,040
it's open source so that they can point

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,129
to and say I did that

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,439
this is really I can't overstate this I

00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:02,949
spent over a decade doing work for hire

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,139
as a web developer and that was all

00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,970
proprietary and most of those websites

00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,260
have rotted are no longer online so I

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,419
don't really have a whole lot to show

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,889
for that time so anytime a student can

00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:16,209
contribute to open source software

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:19,989
that's creating a work history that they

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,789
can always point back to they build

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,250
their network which we all know is

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,050
important students get acquainted with

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,160
other students other contributors on the

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,110
projects

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,730
they're often working they are often

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,200
working with mentors in these open

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,090
source projects who will write them

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,190
letters of recommendation who will be

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,660
there for four years

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,290
sometimes further parity of their

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:46,120
careers to help them navigate their own

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,100
career and of course while they're

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,480
learning by contributing to Foss they're

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,820
contributing to the common good

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,220
something that we're all benefiting from

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,480
they're contributing to the Commons

00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,980
which is good in and of itself they also

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,590
learn about licensing and ownership

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,930
which is kind of an arcane topic that

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,400
not a lot of people get exposed to but

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,160
it's really really critical and

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,950
electoral property is not fun for most

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,790
people but it's important and

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,550
contributing to open source software

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,530
they're going to by osmosis get a sense

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,360
of what licensing means what

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,410
intellectual property is why it's

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,180
important so that's all well and good

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,330
but how about a little perspective what

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,160
what do the students say some of the

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,170
themes I see these are quotes from

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,690
people who've contributed participated

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,480
in Google student programs and there's a

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,220
theme of realizing how much there is to

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,500
learn a little bit of intellectual

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,900
humility especially the students who

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,940
comment on realizing that the active

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,440
testing and version control you know

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,600
they can be whiz-bang building in their

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,420
sandbox but suddenly in an environment

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,490
where there are these new new

00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,990
expectations they realized ok there's a

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,540
whole world out there that I still have

00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,800
to learn about they realize that there

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,850
are some life skills as well that they

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,280
learn in the process they're engaged and

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:10,750
motivated by working on things that

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,000
people use and find useful again

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,830
speaking to real-world problems this is

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,040
a recurring theme and it's one that

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,760
resonates with me I mentioned that I was

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:25,390
a terrible student I skated by on good

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,240
exams and most of my time was spent at

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,540
home working on a computer building

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,090
whatever I found interesting and I found

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,460
it fun and really motivating to be

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,540
building things that people would use

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,710
you know I would launch a website and

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,640
maybe they're only ten people using it

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:46,400
or people using it this is contrasted

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,700
for me against things like worksheets

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:56,360
which although critical are not terribly

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:58,100
motivating so that's the why and I think

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,600
this is but frankly it's preaching to

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,680
the choir you're here at a pike on a you

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,200
let me tell you a little bit about

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,690
Google's open source programs we have

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,300
two programs to help students get into

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,760
Foss first is Google Summer of Code and

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,740
Google coding in this picture you'll see

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,230
some of the winners from this last

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,580
year's Google Google coding these are

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,970
students from all over the world that we

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,500
flew out to to San Francisco including

00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,750
some of my teammates who actually run

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,550
the programs so Google Summer of Code or

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,920
gsok for short it was founded thirteen

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,190
years ago at the behest of Google

00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,570
founder Larry page's complained he

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,050
complained that there were so many

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,240
students in university who were working

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,600
in CS programs and then during the

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,100
summer they would get some some sort of

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,330
job flipping burgers manual labor

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,950
whatever it is something that's not

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,020
contributing to the advancement of their

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,280
career they might have been internet

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,660
earning an income but they weren't

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,330
furthering their education or their

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:04,460
career so he threw some money my team at

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,920
specifically at Google director of open

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,350
source Chris DiBona and thus Google

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,020
Summer of Code this program pays

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:18,370
students to work on free and open source

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:20,810
software so how does it work

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:26,030
open source projects applied to

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:27,710
participate they muster mentors who are

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,920
at the ready to support students

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,530
throughout the program and they also

00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,220
come up with project ideas for students

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,020
to work on so those might be major might

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,060
be small features or major bug fixes

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,040
things that they think are useful for

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,540
the project but also achievable by a

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,800
student we announced projects students

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,020
look at the projects that they're

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,660
interested in they write proposals for

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,320
those applicants

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,630
for those projects and then the projects

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,130
do a selection they look at the project

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,040
applications and then they choose

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,130
students those students then have about

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,360
four months to work on this in May is

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,100
what we call the community bonding

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,600
period that's a time for the student to

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,850
get acquainted with the community with

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,640
the codebase learn the norms learn the

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,310
etiquette and get prepared for three

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,280
months of development lots and lots of

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:24,010
development there are evaluations

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,390
throughout the process that students can

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,310
either pass or fail in those evaluations

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,140
the mentors basically say is the student

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,360
keeping up with what they said they

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,010
would now the mentors aren't there to

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,990
penalize the student if maybe there was

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,300
some unexpected complexity that they

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,980
discovered in their project that happens

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,890
in software and software development

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,740
what the mentor is judging the student

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,950
on is based on the the communication and

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,990
the planning do they realize when

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,970
they've encountered something that will

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,760
change the timeline timeline at their

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,610
project are they communicating on a

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,900
daily weekly basis and in keeping up so

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,280
these are the evaluations the student

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,090
has to pass to get to the end and

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,310
students are paid based on where they

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,460
live and how many evaluations they pass

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,750
so for instance an Australian student

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,350
participating in google Summer of Code

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:24,490
2017 who completes the program is paid

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,040
six thousand US dollars but what about

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,630
younger students right so that's google

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,480
Summer of Code that's for university

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:34,270
students who are aged 18 and up about

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,260
seven years ago google code-in was

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,850
founded google code-in is really part of

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,650
this major push that we're seeing to

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,610
teach students computer literacy and

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,230
software development and I guess our

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,850
team figured why not teach them through

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,820
open source contributions we're already

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:55,750
doing that through google Summer of Code

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,120
so GCI differs from gsok pardon the

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,430
shorthand differs differs from them in a

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,130
few critical ways it's very younger

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,800
younger students it doesn't involve an

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,490
application process it's an open open

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
contest

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,100
where

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,660
there are tasks that students claim and

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,029
we don't pay the students instead we

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,620
reward them with prizes it runs during

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,839
the Northern Hemisphere's winter break

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,860
rather than over the summer and is

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,860
measured in weeks rather than months so

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,500
Enfamil how does GCI Work Projects apply

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,839
to participate and we require that the

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,820
GCI projects have already participated

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,640
in google Summer of Code suffice it to

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,170
say working with young students is even

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,209
more challenging than working with

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,860
University students and so we want to

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,690
know that the organization the

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,029
open-source project is mature enough to

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,760
be there and provide the support that

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,709
these students need so the project's

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,170
apply we accept them and then they

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,779
create an array of tasks from various

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,690
difficulty levels including tasks that

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,690
are repeatable like install docker or

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:02,060
install Linux you know things that are

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,440
necessary for them to do the more

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,579
advanced tests maybe it's just setting

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,290
up the in development development

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,589
environment just setting up the

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,680
development environment the tasks also

00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:14,570
arranged in an area so their coding

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,610
tasks their documentation there's

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,029
training outreach research Quality

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,320
Assurance and user interface design so

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,170
there are array of things that students

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,540
can do and the students claim one task

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,700
at a time and the tasks are they're

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,320
either given three days or seven days to

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,880
work on that task with the support of

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,110
mentors in both G sock and GCI

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,970
participants get some level of like swag

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,829
and prizes for for completing these

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:46,220
tasks for each project that participates

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:48,649
in Google coding there is one finalist

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,540
chosen and two grand prize winners who

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,360
are chosen and the project chooses those

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,410
those are that's not our team those are

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,120
the people that we saw in that photo

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,529
earlier we fly them out wherever they

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,529
are in the world we fly them to San

00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:02,860
Francisco for for a few days and they

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,810
meet Google engineers they meet people

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,720
Google engineers from their country we

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,370
show them San Francisco and many many of

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,899
these people it's either the first time

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,790
on an airplane or the first time in the

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,949
US or their first time in San Francisco

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,850
and it's an incredible experience seeing

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:23,480
what seeing what it means to these two

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,709
I have to go through this so what do

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
what do these that students actually

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,980
work on I've been talking about this

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,420
really into abstract and mechanically

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:35,329
like what are the projects so here we

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,980
see a sampling of the projects that

00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,329
participate in our pictures

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,089
participating in this year's Google

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:43,730
Summer of Code last year we had 17

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,560
projects in GCI this year we have 201

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,230
projects in G Sauk some of those

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,000
projects represent sub projects for

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,670
instance the Python Software Foundation

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,550
represents many many sub projects that

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,410
use Python the project's range from

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,470
operating systems to 3d modeling

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,690
robotics gaming there are humanitarian

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,850
projects like openmrs and libre health

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,170
and my false initiative and there are

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,750
also projects at aligned with other

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,769
subjects that they could be learning

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:14,449
chemistry mathematics astronomy etc so

00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,130
the bold names on this list are projects

00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:20,149
that explicitly involve some sort of

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:23,029
python the projects that are dark in a

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,949
dark color there are projects well there

00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,399
are people from those projects here at

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:30,470
PyCon AU and specifically beware and ten

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,420
videos they're going to be part going to

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,980
be participating in the sprints at the

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,449
end of this conference so if you're

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,529
sticking around for the conference or

00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:39,410
even if you're not and you're still in

00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:40,730
town I encourage you to go to the

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,819
sprints and talk to the people behind

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,000
those projects because they are projects

00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:51,949
that are are very welcoming and are

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,019
great for getting students on board so

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,110
as I mentioned for a google Summer of

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,970
Code it requires students to apply and

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,740
that require some elbow grease and a

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,970
little luck it's it's a little little

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,880
competitive

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,310
now while google code-in doesn't require

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,959
applications there are certainly ways to

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,430
prepare for the program and so I'm going

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,920
to briefly talk about what it means to

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,360
get prepared for Google Summer of Code

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,649
knowing that a subset of this is useful

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,630
for a GCI as well so not every project

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,790
participates every year but most come

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,009
back so looking at who has participated

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,040
is a good way to gauge who is going to

00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:29,689
participate again a student should look

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,540
at the projects that are interesting to

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:34,970
them and are

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,670
using technologies that they have some

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,950
experience with the most successful

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,330
students explore code bases and get

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,760
acquainted with the project communities

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:47,060
via issue tracker is via IRC slack

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,020
whatever it is when the projects are

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,340
announced the ones that are

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,420
participating for the current year

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:55,580
they'll provide those project ideas and

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,840
at that point is when projects can when

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,020
students can really start working on

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,790
their proposals now students don't need

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,720
to write their proposals based on the

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,950
projects that the organ organizations

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,410
suggest they can write their own

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,910
proposals in that case it's particularly

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,350
important for them to talk to the

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,510
mentors and the people behind the

00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,220
project so that they can help refine

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,870
that proposal to make sure that it's a

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:23,570
reasonable scope something that's useful

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:25,400
something that they can support we again

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,780
encourage students to communicate with

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,880
the project's through this process and

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:36,710
we list the project's contact info on

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:38,180
the website and then hope so I told you

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,390
I was going to address an elephant in

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,240
the room and this is that moment gee

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,280
sock and GCI are timed to coincide with

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,730
summer and winter breaks in the northern

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,410
hemisphere this means students in the

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,940
southern hemisphere might find that gee

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,920
sock and gcci fault partially or

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,080
completely on top of their school year

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,970
so while this doesn't dissuade students

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,640
we have countless students who

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,410
participate from India who do it on top

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,870
of school it does make things more

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,850
difficult that's why I'm going to spend

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,410
the rest of this talk sharing with you

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,750
other resources for getting students

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,410
into false

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,390
sofirst resources for instructors again

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,370
these links are all being tweeted search

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,160
that hashtag to find it all teaching

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,829
open source org is a hub of useful

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,800
information on the why how and what

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,780
other people are doing to get students

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,600
into Faust's that's a great jumping-off

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,360
point Posse professors open-source

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,400
software experience is a workshop run in

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,980
the US and Europe for uni instructors

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,240
who are creating curriculum that gets

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,640
their students to contribute to

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,360
humanitarian free open-source project

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,280
software projects

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,559
hasn't been running in Australia or New

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,179
Zealand yet and so if there's anybody

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,710
who's interested in helping it helping

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,330
to bring it here please let me know

00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,230
because I would love to put them over

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,750
there's a organisers in touch with you

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:05,429
similarly floss tux desktops for kids is

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:07,590
not run here yet that is a program that

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,150
refurbished refurbishes desktop

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,650
computers to help schools that don't

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,320
even have the hardware for students to

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,150
learn on and they install open-source

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,390
software on those machines such that

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,610
there are no licensing fees etc that's

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,370
only in the US but I know the man who

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,290
runs that program and Patrick and he

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,460
would love to expand that to Australia

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,919
and New Zealand so again if you're

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,630
interested you know schools that need

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,570
that kind of thing please let me know

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,640
and we'd love to put something together

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,320
open-source guide is a project recently

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,750
launched by github

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,580
it contains useful information like how

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,280
to contribute to open source or how to

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,559
create an open source project open

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,630
source way also known as open source com

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,820
is a community news website run by

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,770
redhack which contains a lot of useful

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,110
information there are two articles in

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:59,700
particular that I just tweeted so I

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,290
encourage you to take a look at that is

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,559
of course sponsored by Red Hat and Red

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:06,419
Hat has their own host of resources for

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,270
educators who want to get their students

00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:12,360
into Foss and I encourage you to explore

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,370
all of those things ok so let's talk

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,410
about what's the student facing things

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:21,360
here coderdojo

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:24,090
is a worldwide volunteer run network of

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,040
of clubs for some student for young

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,900
people who want to learn and work with

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,309
technology and particular open-source

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,410
technology there are over a hundred

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:34,440
clubs in Australia so this is not one of

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,650
those us-centric things outreaching is

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,030
like google Summer of Code but

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,700
specifically for people who are

00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,770
underrepresented in the tech industry

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,480
like women and ethnic minorities this

00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:50,790
lit this year's Linux coffee a you

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,460
raised 20 upwards of $29,000 to place

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,840
three interns for that program it's a

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,669
wonderful program and I encourage people

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,679
to check it out

00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:59,250
rails girls Summer of Code like outreach

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,670
e is

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,370
four caters to women who are

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,380
underrepresented in the tech industry

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,820
it's not just for rails and it's

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,280
different from outreaching and gsok

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,760
insofar as you apply as a team and not

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,650
as an individual season of KDE is an

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,120
open source is an example of an open

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,360
source project who has created their own

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,210
GE sock-like thing and then there's of

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,580
course the X org endless vacation of

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,860
code which has an excellent name there's

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,410
also the European Space Agency's Summer

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,880
of Code in space I didn't list them here

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,930
because their websites down right now

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,670
but I'm pretty sure they're still active

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,080
so there are there those programs and

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,250
then there are self-guided options for

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,240
students you might want to do this on

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:47,130
their own time there are one of the

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,700
great ways to get started is look at

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,710
issue tags there's been a initiative

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,570
issue tags being the tags that one would

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,150
use on an issue tracker or on a website

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,910
like github to describe the nature of an

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:04,950
issue and projects are increasingly

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:06,600
using tags to identify projects or tasks

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,300
that would be useful for someone or

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,220
approachable for someone who is new to

00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,190
open-source development or development

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,380
in general there are a couple twitter

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,760
handles and websites that aggregate this

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,730
stuff so students don't actually have to

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,860
search all that hard for it the ones on

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:27,930
the right there are those handles and

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,850
websites some other self get adoptions

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,880
are just to approach a project that is

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,710
known as newbie friendly some open

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,320
source projects are more welcoming

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,030
communities than others some open source

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,400
projects have done a better job of

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:44,390
building on ramps for newcomers than

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,260
others and these four are outstanding

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,060
beware mentioned earlier which is

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,620
present at this conference is a

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,720
collection of projects that enable

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,910
Python developers to build websites and

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,530
native desktop and mobile apps using

00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:00,090
Python it's kind of magical and it's a

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:03,030
great project that's very very welcoming

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,950
habiddig a role-playing game that helps

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,590
people build good habits and fight

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,990
procrastination so being that it's a

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,420
game for good cause it's kind of a fun

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,340
thing to contribute to you

00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,930
hoody is a project that helps developers

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,020
build websites and applications that

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,280
work offline and public lab personal

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,380
favorite of mine is a community that

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,720
develops open-source tools for

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,180
environmental science and citizen

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,770
science but there are a lot more than

00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,290
just these four projects that people can

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,420
check out for instance even if a student

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,630
can't participate in google Summer of

00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,010
Code or Google Code in the projects that

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,110
do participate in those in our programs

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,870
necessarily structure themselves so that

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,610
there are on ramps for newcomers right

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,200
if they haven't built those on ramps by

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,030
the time they start the program they

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,860
certainly have by the end what that

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,470
means is having decent documentation

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,660
having mentorship having a culture that

00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,390
doesn't say you know doesn't just tell a

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:04,490
student to heart tfn and you know these

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,780
are these are projects that you can find

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,740
that are almost guaranteed to be a good

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,210
environment for people so we talked

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,030
about why contributing to open source is

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:18,210
a great way to learn we discussed the

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,680
Google programs ji-suk and GCI and we

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,570
covered a bunch of other resources for

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,050
for you as instructors and also for

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,390
students to get started we will be

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,550
announcing dates for the next to Google

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,940
programs the next four weeks you can

00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:36,360
find that information on those websites

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,790
my hope my hope is that you will

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,100
incorporate contributions to open source

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,530
into your curriculum as much as you can

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,370
insofar as it's valuable for the student

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,110
and valuable for the greater community

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,150
so I'll say it one last time

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,950
I have tweeted a whole lot of links

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,390
using that hashtag you don't have to be

00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,590
a Twitter user so just search those

00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:02,660
things you'll find all of those

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:02,660
references with that questions

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:12,890
Thank You Josh raise hands and I'll

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,270
bring the mic over so I don't know how

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,059
easily you're gonna be able to address

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,830
this one Josh but we've got working with

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,120
kids and letting them interact with

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,360
people outside of schools is really

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,460
problematic here in Australia you know

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,890
just to tutor people in an online forum

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,600
requires every person involved to have

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,370
some kind of working with children

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,190
check-in their relevant state or

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,500
territory so you're saying here get

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,940
involved in open-source that's gonna be

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,100
interacting with a lot of people who

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,520
maybe don't hold those qualifications

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,290
Howard teachers deal with that issue if

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,720
they're trying to sell this to school

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,240
leadership or to approach these groups

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,860
to say hey we want to get involved but

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,390
you need every single person who works

00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,910
on your project to get a working with

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,170
children check right right that is a

00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,910
very good question and as you

00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,220
anticipated not one I'm actually all

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,240
that prepared to answer but that's

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,360
something that I would be happy to

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,970
follow up on because I know that there

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,320
are I know that it's happening and I

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,570
think for instance that teaching open

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,840
source org is something that covers it

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,820
pretty pretty thoroughly if you come up

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,110
to me afterwards I'd love to get your

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:24,550
contact information so I could follow up

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,550
with you on that any further questions

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,710
thank you for your talk I wanted to ask

00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:41,809
if is it floss for floss desktop for

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,379
kids do you know if they would be

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,249
interested in expand to Africa

00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:48,710
absolutely yes

00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:51,049
floss test stop for kids is a program of

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,090
the open source initiative and I know

00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,070
that one of one of that organization's

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:57,470
priorities this year in fact has been

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,599
expanding becoming more of an

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,379
international organization Africa
