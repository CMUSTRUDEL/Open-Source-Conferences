Title: Panel: Python in the webs
Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	This will be a panel discussion wherein we wax philosophical about the state of web frameworks in
Python - talking about invention, reinvention, multitudes of choice, how all of them suck, etc. Panelists will include Dylan Jay, Malcolm Tredinnick, Russell Keith-Magee and Richard Jones.

hey right sorry was it your turn yes

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,460
it's my turn now so yes I'm Malcolm

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,080
shidduch and I'm everyone else took a

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,969
step back when we decided who was going

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,559
to moderate this panel I wasn't fast

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,120
enough so i'm stuck doing the moderation

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,199
but i also have opinions i'll be

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
answering some questions so yeah

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,189
nominally this is a panel on web

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,630
frameworks in general it may be the

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,519
least prepared panel you've ever seen in

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,679
your life so we'll see how it goes all

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,059
right so I thought start off with run

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,950
down the table I don't care if Richard

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,280
goes first to Russell goes first who are

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,960
you and what's your involvement with

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,579
with what web frameworks do you use

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,430
generally what's your involvement here

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,469
why are you here all right I'll go think

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,989
I mean I you may have just i just

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,879
presented a frame a talk on micro

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,210
frameworks which is my primary use of

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,430
web stuff i also developed sopot work

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,609
and i've written a bunch of web

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,079
frameworks the python package index or

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,210
cheese shop i mean that's one of the web

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,700
frameworks i've written that I'm quite

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,590
embarrassed about so yeah I'm a more of

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,119
a getting and do it myself although i

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,380
have used django and Django is awesome

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,520
but I haven't contributed any code or

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,430
anything so my name is Dylan Jay I run a

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,110
company and we do CMS development so we

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,759
use plone which is the largest o largest

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,890
most active python CMS and is used by a

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,850
lot of sites out there in the world like

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,490
CIA FBI it's incredibly secure we also

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,000
do some pyramid stuff and of course plan

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,860
is built on so too and I'm Russell pte

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm a django core developer and

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,560
president of the Django Software

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,760
Foundation which is the IP and

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,190
fundraising arm of Django

00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,410
I have gone through a series of jobs

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,360
essentially building Django websites

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,480
except not you know not in the usual

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,800
capacity of a web development shop where

00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,390
someone comes to you as a customer and

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,810
what's their website in your product it

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,030
tends to be building a an application

00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,490
that is on the web that then it becomes

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,020
a product that it sold so by volume by

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,970
number of websites I haven't actually

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,230
built that many but the ones that I've

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,610
built have ended up being very very

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,930
large and complicated and lots of

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,240
foreign processing and security issues

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,550
and what have you so my interest in

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,040
engine being involved in Django is

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,050
mostly to support my web based

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,140
application stuff that I am man have

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,400
previously built and I've done a lot of

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,680
Django work as well over the years

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,630
mostly I don't like the web very much so

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,310
I mostly focus on back in the middle

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,470
layer stuff that I have work for

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,540
websites that have had over 100 million

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,950
users and microphone doesn't seem to be

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,980
working very well and so yeah yeah I

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,480
have some user base experience as well

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,110
i'm tempted to claim citation needed on

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,500
this plane is the most popular CMS and

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,340
of course produce the evidence for that

00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,570
okay so pick someone at random Dylan

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,340
maybe what do you look for when you're

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,220
choosing a framework beyond I only work

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,600
with clone I mean how do you do look

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,040
around at other frameworks from time to

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,350
time and say you know am I still making

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,940
the right choice or is or what can I

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,660
steal from them how do you approach that

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,920
a problem um I mean when you talk about

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,330
frameworks it's kind of interesting

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
because this is something I try and put

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,750
in the front of each of my slides is

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,170
that there's a difference between a CMS

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,530
and a web framework so a CMS is kind of

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,540
like batteries included and if you want

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,260
CMS's in the world people know about

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,920
this there's the triples the Juma's the

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,560
WordPress and all the other PHP ones and

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,950
the rest of the world and there's a few

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,120
other ones in different languages but in

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,370
terms of you know maturity clone is it

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,600
in terms of features and and everything

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,490
like that for the lightweight stuff

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,530
you know I'd give a talk on pyramid I

00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,660
think that is a natural choice for

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,190
people who come from those oak world and

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:07,010
the plone world because it uses a lot of

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:10,100
the same idioms and yeah I mean I've

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,810
used I've used tornado as well and G

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,200
event and played around with stuff like

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,130
that but I think the biggest problem of

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,410
all these things as there's so many

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,580
frameworks unless you're Richard and sit

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,560
down and play with all of them most

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:25,010
people i gotta pick one and go for it

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,550
and and and learn it well and if I might

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,620
add that yes the it was interesting

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,140
writing that talk about the frameworks

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,490
because in the end I evaluated something

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:40,600
like 14 micro frameworks only ten of

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,580
which actually made it into the talk but

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,890
before I did that I had actually done

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,900
some work using one of them thinking it

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,850
was the best solution for what I was

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,910
doing but as it turns out there was

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,180
something better and now i'm using that

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,610
so it's really hard to unless you're

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,490
going to spend a considerable amount of

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,810
effort it's hard to exactly to actually

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,870
analyze these things and figure out

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,730
which one's the best even given the

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,100
rather enormous amount of information

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:14,270
that's out there for each of you know

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,880
the mega frameworks my backstory is

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,950
vaguely relevant here by I came to

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,470
django by virtue of some tinkering i

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,720
have enjoyed in programming in python

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,940
but was never doing it commercially the

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,530
reason i got to django as a cord way

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,120
home became a core developer was that I

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,100
had an idea of this thing I was

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,980
tinkering with and figured hey the web

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,480
is a way of making it happen and looked

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,920
around at a bunch of options this was

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,720
sort of the time when Ruby on Rails was

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,300
just starting to get a lot of press soap

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,940
was around and was that was how you do

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,130
it in Python at the time and this Jango

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,810
things started up and I tried cherry pie

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,050
and I tried Ruby on Rails and none of

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,060
them really stuck just the mental model

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,770
just didn't quite work would I didn't

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,120
quite get where it came from or what

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,640
were they were trying to do what they

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,390
were doing and then Django had

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,410
extraordinarily good documentation

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,930
extraordinarily good at the time it's

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,040
still good could be better there are

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,370
some for areas where it's fallen down

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,620
but still very good documentation and it

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,560
made sense when I sat down to try and do

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,210
it it made sense and as a result of that

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I've got more involved in submitted

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,990
patches and became a core developer and

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,320
rest is history in terms of looking

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,910
around other options I haven't I used to

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,560
spend a lot more time looking at other

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,430
other frameworks to see what else can

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,600
what ideas can be steel type stuff

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,340
honestly I haven't spent a lot of time

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,930
doing that of light in the last couple

00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,910
of years mostly because of available

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,040
time but also because Django's doing

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,260
everything that I need it to do there is

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,270
a bit of a gap emerging where I'm kind

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,590
of wondering think things like all this

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:51,460
of a long pole request dynamic dynamic

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,479
content by genomic content stuff that

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,979
Django doesn't have a really good story

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,750
for that I'm you know but i also don't

00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:58,460
have a personal need to pursue yet i

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,620
imagine though if i needed to actually

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,810
build it like John asked Alex how to do

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,280
it sorry Alex Kane and other cool

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,820
developer has done a bunch of this sort

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,260
of stuff and find out you can we do that

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,280
in Django should be we do Eazy another

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,720
framework and that would be the time

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,960
which I start looking looking at other

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,850
options one more perspective on that as

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,430
a business owner there's another aspect

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,470
to picking technology and I think in the

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,560
Python world where where people who like

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,479
aesthetics and like to find the best you

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,890
know possible frame 0 at the end of the

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,890
day you've got to employ people to

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,419
create those applications and the skills

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,610
that are out there actually has an

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,229
influence as well and I think that the

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,390
fact that Django is so popular is is

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,580
incredibly good because that means that

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,840
you can go out I know that a lot of

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,070
people going out to the market trying to

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,020
get Django people where maybe not

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,000
getting at the moment but that's going

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,100
to create more Django people you will

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,250
find lots and lots of Django developers

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,560
and that is a really good thing a reason

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,390
to pick Django if you're doing a side

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
project or something like that great to

00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,819
experiment and try

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,919
the things unfortunately the you know

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,090
the the logical extension of that

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,199
argument is that we should all be doing

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:11,639
PHP so the Wonder colludes me um

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,560
something specifically I guess for

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,990
Richard but I'll throw some commentary

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,909
another start when I'm using Django and

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,889
when I'm using frameworks and other

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,270
languages the ones that stick with me

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:22,830
the most are the ones that actually I

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,139
can use them as a library rather than a

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,449
framework in that I call them rather

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,210
they call me so sort of Western world

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,039
versus soviet russia or something and

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,510
something like Django is you know

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,159
probably ten percent framework there's

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,959
very few bits actually call into your

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,529
code and most the time you're calling

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,579
Jenga so that means the Django library

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,620
Richard you're the one with the sort of

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:45,720
most most experienced together table

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,310
running around with different different

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,870
ones of these things you're having

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,209
evaluated for example the micro

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,990
frameworks do you get the feeling that

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,430
that's a some kind of discriminator or

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,380
quality indication or something how much

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,850
the framework bottles you up inside what

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,630
the framework wants to do versus how

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:08,399
much you can absolutely absolutely we

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,839
have one system at our work where it

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,760
should have been implemented behind a

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,820
micro framework but unfortunately it was

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,430
implemented by as a turbo gears

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,649
application and so it's structured in

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,089
the turbo gears way which isn't actually

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,890
that bad but there's a whole lot of

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,050
additional baggage around at about

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,550
configuration files and the way to have

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,649
0 gears does things i'm not saying to

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,839
vicky's is bad it's just that it turns

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,540
what should be a very simple and

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,579
straightforward application with obvious

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,620
entry points and so forth into something

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,790
that's not as obvious and not a

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,290
straightforward and so I this is why in

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,060
my talk today I didn't really talk about

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,970
I didn't explicitly didn't talk about

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,040
the mega frameworks because they in all

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,660
all of them in their own ways they

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,250
dictate what your application is going

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,980
to look like whereas with the micro

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,720
frameworks you're pretty much opened us

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,390
to say look here's a callable thing

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,170
publish it to the web and it doesn't

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,670
really matter where that

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,399
ball thing comes from inside your

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,139
application and you know that gives you

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,300
so much flexibility career as a

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,410
corollary of that if I could that

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,600
question that I've sort of wanted to ask

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,610
them by new this panel is coming the

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,769
thing that's weird for me as a django

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,660
core developer is everyone coming up and

00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,190
talking about these micro frameworks and

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,130
these micro frameworks are really great

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,540
because they are so lightweight the

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,060
weird thing is for me i look at django

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,560
and i think is a micro framework but i

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,149
appreciate their our axis on which it

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,139
isn't because it is a large download and

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:35,670
it does a lot of stuff but the this sort

00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,440
of generation and by this generation I

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,899
mean the Ruby on Rails Django to evoke

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,240
is not special to Vegas maybe but their

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,940
possibilities really there there are

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,920
mechanism for translating a request to a

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,209
function that returns a response and

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,560
there's a lot of other stuff around the

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,720
outside of that it is necessary but

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,139
what's in your mighty to you having used

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,970
micro frameworks both in action and that

00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,279
twit what's what's the line that

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,110
separates the mega framework that is

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,420
Django from the micro framework that is

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,130
flask or bottle law well it's a pretty

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,370
simple distinction can the application

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,190
be developed in one file and none of the

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,560
mega frameworks will let you do that

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,779
there's always or and in fact in some

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,260
cases they may but you have to do some

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:21,089
fun tricks to define these new data

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,800
structures inside your one file that

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,070
have nothing to do with the application

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,589
to make the application work and so that

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,120
you know that additional overhead that

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,250
additional burden means that it's not

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,410
lightweight anymore okay how often do

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,570
you building web applications that are

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,820
really sensibly only one file look all

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:44,160
the time a simple example would be I

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:49,140
have an application so actually one of

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,199
the telco ones but it it we have a whole

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,899
lot of log files around you know two

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,940
dozen or so systems we aggregate them in

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,680
a central point we index them using that

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,120
awesome awesome indexer that I've

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,889
forgotten the name of the pure python

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,339
one it's so awesome it doesn't have a

00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,980
name

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,990
it'll be 19 wood though it'll come to me

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,629
another one um it's really cool do you

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:13,050
buy wood sorry would your wash wash

00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,910
which is awesome and so they indexes

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,370
those things and the web interface for

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:20,009
that is a single file because it doesn't

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,259
do much it handles a post and renders a

00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,999
response and it's all in the one place

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,709
you want to know how the web framework

00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:28,559
if web interface works your look in a

00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,970
single file and that's nice I think the

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,769
other aspect to it is learning curve

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,449
it's like you know you take something

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,850
like blown and you can do lightweight

00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:37,290
start with it but there's loads and

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,389
loads of documentation of all the other

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,920
stuff it can do and and Django probably

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,389
sits halfway in between you know as

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,410
there are on lever and stuff like that

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:49,230
so there are all these distractions of

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,449
learning what not to use about a mega

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,889
framework and the CMS is essentially a

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,350
mega-mega framework you know it's very

00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:57,809
opinionated I think the one other aspect

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,939
I want to talk about is that there's a

00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,370
trade-off because what you get with

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,100
Django to some extent and things like

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,559
playing even more is that you get to

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,699
reuse a more bits of code you know

00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,519
something like phone has a plug-in

00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:13,290
architecture so you can plug in a

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,749
mailing list manager or you can plug in

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,300
a an e-commerce framework because it

00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,769
knows whether users are with the content

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,559
is its opinionated about all those

00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:25,439
different things so you get a massive

00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,439
amount of innovation and functionality

00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:29,699
around that but in order to create those

00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:33,240
things and learn those things you've got

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,009
to learn more framework so the CMS is

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,749
are good for people building sites for

00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,339
other people on a really rather basis

00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,749
because I will have to train someone up

00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,149
for six months to get up to the level

00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:44,790
where they can you know do productive

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:46,920
things things like microphones and stuff

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,920
like that you can learn in AH you know

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,470
half a day oh yeah bottle you can learn

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,399
in like half an hour following on from

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,170
that Django is always at this tag line

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,329
of thought perfectionist with deadlines

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,649
and I've been known to shadow people in

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,120
capital letters our mailing list that it

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,420
doesn't say for beginners with deadlines

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,949
what about this learning curve versus

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,079
allocating because there is this sort of

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,850
beginner entry-level stuff but nobody

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,649
stays a beginner forever you do actually

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,779
move up the curve and maybe you hit the

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,710
clear for maybe you fall off the cliff

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,600
do you think we're kind of getting the

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,200
balance right there with the larger

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,279
frameworks versus the smaller ones we're

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,850
definitely doing better than zope two

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,200
damning with friends but and as you got

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,670
there's something I think there is one

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,350
look from an educational perspective I

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,839
think there is one really big benefit to

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,839
the micro frameworks in that they force

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,060
you to understand what HTTP is I mean

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,010
these are there is a consistent refrain

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,680
on the Django users mailing list of I

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,110
want to do this thing and I want to call

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,779
off a fork in the middle of my request

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,370
and run this half hour process it

00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,920
doesn't seem to be working right and

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,360
it's locking up my web server well yeah

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,400
cuz that's what's going to happen that's

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,830
not how HTTP works and there's there is

00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,060
a and this is part of my my undergrad

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,650
degrees in physics I came through

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,040
artificial intelligence and landed in

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:13,210
software engineering I've never formally

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,740
studied HTTP and it wasn't until like

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,960
essentially wasn't until I got Django in

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,210
my hands I really got a feel for old

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,830
this is what the HTTP spec is all about

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,230
now I get what you're doing the micro

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,640
the microphone works are so close to the

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,680
metal they do force you to realize that

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,839
it is just this pipeline of function in

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,250
requesting response out and you can't

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,050
have a long live thing and it can't

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,150
consume lots of resources and that's

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:41,050
that's a valuable education exercise in

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,520
itself Django then it has a bunch of

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,790
stuff that's on top of that but still

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,930
exposes it to you with some levels so

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,390
yeah but do you think we're maybe

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,490
putting too much or too little emphasis

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,260
on the entry level side of things as

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,029
opposed to the power user like everyone

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,070
on this stage is reasonably power user

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,040
of the things we use and could probably

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,260
pick up most things fairly quickly but

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,300
I'm not a power user of Django but I can

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,770
pick it up in no time I mean actual

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,660
values are many other by I am yes but

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,029
they don't translate I'm a power user of

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,320
soap too and that that infects your head

00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:15,490
I mean that changes the way you think

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,209
about that

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,440
um me they had the therapy good look at

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:26,200
me I'm an example but have it I can I've

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,029
developed a couple of very simple apple

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,770
websites in Django but I do not consider

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,959
myself an expert in fact I've developed

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,610
in point nine point like the point nine

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,490
one or something so most of the stuff I

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,560
learned is no longer valid but I know

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,720
that I can pick it up again relatively

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,140
easy because the documentation is is

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,790
well laid out for a beginner so it does

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,190
there's really very little curve there

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,120
for the learning did you put this also I

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,149
mean there's a there's a there's a

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,700
matter about sensible defaults know the

00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,410
the obvious way to do it is the sensible

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,970
default way to do it and you don't need

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,190
a great deal of extra bottle no extra

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,689
boilerplate around the outside of that

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,949
Django then gives you all sorts of other

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,300
ways that you can plug in your own

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,920
template language and your own forms

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,760
library and get into the internals of

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,860
any any line forms it and tweak all that

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,360
so it's it's a matter of having an API

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,720
that's rich enough to let you get in

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,059
there and do the hard stuff but the

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,760
default version of just rendered this

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:28,420
form dammit works and protects you from

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,690
CSS and access it yes sir how much does

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,160
the easy low barrier to entry interfere

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,429
with when you then want to go and do

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,420
power stuff oh just before you go on to

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:39,160
the next which I think the other thing

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,080
to think about is that I don't think we

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,809
can have enough of the beginner stuff I

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,270
mean because so many people come to

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,830
programming from PHP you know they

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,500
that's the first bit of programming they

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,850
do people are exposed to the web people

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,929
want to create their own website and

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,900
then want a little bit add a bit of

00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:58,330
dynamic stuff to it the more we have the

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,700
ability to create really easy Python

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,160
stuff the less they can go through

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,420
having to touch PHP and that's a good

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,740
thing

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,830
it's late for me we have to undo the

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,540
right all right so we got about 10

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,550
minutes left eight minutes left but we

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,350
might open it up for questions on the

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,060
floor remember question is a sentence it

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,680
ends in a question mark so if you start

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,010
with I have a comment that's not a good

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:27,010
start microphone over here so stick your

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:33,650
hand up if you have a question oh pardon

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:36,140
my last question yes does so so yes are

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,370
we I mean I think it's sort of I'm

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,870
getting the feeling of what the answer

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,570
is but yes I was wondering if anyone

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,100
thought we were making it I definitely

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,450
agree with you know we can't have too

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,220
much beginner stuff but the same time

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,540
you shouldn't then get to the point of I

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,520
want to do something really difficult

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,470
and I can't do it because stop holding

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,060
my hand damn it I'm actually you know

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,950
I'm allowed to take the training wheels

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,650
off Python for consenting adults type of

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,720
stuff oh yeah i don't know but i don't

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,970
think that the two unnecessarily

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,720
mutually exclusive good good API design

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,340
allows altered but and diamond there

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,080
sure there are areas in Django's API

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,250
where we don't do a great job at it but

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,690
i'm sure that's true of any framework

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,160
that's evolved over a period of you know

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,700
what I years or something at this point

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,370
so you know good API design I don't

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,380
think precludes having both having both

00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,270
beginners with easy defaults and experts

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,170
being able to manage the internal to the

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,170
point you don't really doesn't

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,940
extensibility of multiple levels yes I

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,680
mean I think I tried to sort of

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,030
emphasize that a little bit in and the

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,180
pyramid talk yesterday is that you can

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,500
do it in one file you can have something

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,450
very simple but it has so much

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,370
extensibility and that is you know

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,870
learning the lessons of other things

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,550
that needed to be extended in different

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,230
ways and building the framework with

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:49,340
that in mind and it's not necessarily

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,990
mutually exclusive but dr. sybers

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,220
question as well yeah we haven't quite

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,420
learned from the clouds okay so

00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,080
independent of micro frameworks or mega

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,840
frameworks or Jurassic frameworks all

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,120
you want to call them one of the things

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,730
that Malcolm mentioned earlier was you i

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,070
think was PHP do you think the

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,260
predominance of people or PHP on hosting

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,520
servers and cloud and all that sort of

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,650
stuff is holding people learning

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,830
right way on with Python and the

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:23,460
difficulty of hosting that is holding

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:25,650
Python back independent of whatever yes

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,090
i agree i think it does i think there is

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,940
something as a community that we need to

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,070
have a very long hard talk amongst us

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,710
and all the other guys we manage these

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,300
projects about coming up with a solid

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,910
story that we can sell to hosting

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,590
providers about if you put product X on

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,390
your website we will send your customers

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,980
and all they will need to do is give you

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,870
a blob and the blob will run on the on

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,590
the website in the same way that you

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,410
send you a PHP file and it just runs

00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:55,020
though the model that it's vaguely

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,840
applicable as kind of the Java been

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,490
thinking you someone's got a j2ee

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,740
container you give them the V nor the

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,300
war file and it goes off jungle and

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,950
Jason was actually a good example where

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,440
you could package up Django as a war

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,940
file and it would run late literally

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,760
they would just drop it into tom cat and

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,650
it would run yeah and I whiskey gets one

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,230
part of that picture in terms of here is

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,640
an API that lets us all agree that you

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,560
could plug it into Apache or any other

00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,780
whiskey compliant container but it

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,000
doesn't cover where the whiskey file is

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,490
in the in the zip or in there in the

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,530
collection of code and it doesn't cover

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,590
where do I put my static files and how

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,000
do i define the dependencies now I hope

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,040
we haven't missed the boat on this

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,770
because we have got particularly in the

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:42,210
Django pseudo Django community things

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:45,600
like Gondor and EPO and anglers resume

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,280
that are commercial companies that are

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,040
realizing people want to launch their

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,570
Django website easily in case of epo it

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,010
really is just whiskey but you know that

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,260
Django is obviously a big thing because

00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:00,120
andrew is a django core developer i

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,400
would i hope that before these guys get

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,810
too entrenched and have their own market

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,970
shares that we actually find out what

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,970
lingua franca is work out what the set

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,530
of specifications are and they all agree

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,760
on a spec that we can then publicize

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,410
their something that anyone can

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,560
implement come up with the way of we can

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,500
we can ship that and product eyes Django

00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,120
deployment or Python web deployment as a

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,280
as a thing in the same way with PHP

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,970
makes it easy I mean anything from the

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,400
CMS world you know

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,370
drupal joomla wordpress are so

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,929
incredibly popular and because you can

00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,460
run them on you know you can go to

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,559
cpanel on any you know seven dollar a

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,640
year poster and click and go drupal

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,710
instance installing plan is is a really

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,510
easy using easy install you know you

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,570
just go easy install plan on or build

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,100
out or whatever but that's just too hard

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,260
that's the thing it's like I think we're

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,539
a little bit of a suffer from the fact

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,520
that we're all a bit of the Linux nerd

00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,350
you know we kind of used to command

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,909
minds and things like that and there's a

00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,340
whole bunch of talented program is out

00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,539
there who are you know we can't be too

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,190
snobby about this we have to create

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,470
easier ways to do hosting and lisanna

00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,330
I'll also say the dark side of the PHP

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,970
easy to install joomla or wordpress

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,679
particularly is shared hosting providers

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,510
are very happy to do that right up until

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,520
the point it's us using lots of memory

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,690
or bandwidth or database at which point

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,760
this and please take your wordpress

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,200
install somewhere else and you're really

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,520
as well at this point because you've now

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,080
got to learn how to migrate a database

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,880
and dump the database and put it

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,470
somewhere else but you're already pop

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,409
committed that's a thing you know yeah

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,510
that's you know it the pain point comes

00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,580
a little bit later is i've seen i also

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,500
say i take a much more commandingly

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,150
viewpoint on this of a theme my general

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,480
feeling is you must be smarter than this

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:43,210
stick to using internet and the web is a

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,600
dangerous place and if you're you know

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,610
not quite at the point that installing

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,580
you know your web framework in your

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,140
hosting account is something you can do

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,120
maybe it's time to not go and play on

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,890
the road just yet and I mean I that is a

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,179
very severe position and I think you

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,520
know there's a middle ground we had

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,799
there but there is going to be a big fat

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,110
end of let's call them stupid people who

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,580
you get something out there as this

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,169
learning about security and stuff like

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,299
that and it's gonna end it's it's the

00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,220
1990s all over again right there's so

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,289
many exploitable websites out there and

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,460
problems like this that maybe having a

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,230
little bit of a barrier to entry or

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,400
driver's license is not such a bad thing

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:23,919
here fo the problem with that argument

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,600
is that if Python takes the high ground

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,950
there they're just gonna go and use PHP

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,390
and that you know there's always going

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,400
to be someone who will sell the

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,900
unlicensed driver at the agent you can

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,030
clean up that one I mean

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,320
it's the microsoft thing of you know

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,240
let's release something that's buggy

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,820
first and then get the market share and

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,630
then fix it later you want to save the

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,760
web not the stupid people points right

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,350
okay thank one else ever touched her

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:55,540
Elena's stand there with microphones I'm

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:56,830
taking that as a note oops um just

00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,570
following on from Richard's last talk

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,820
with all those like a number of micro

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,830
frameworks um do you guys think that

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,690
it's sort of I mean looking at how many

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,130
of those are so similar do you think it

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,230
would be better to keep the diversity of

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,450
those or for those sort of things to

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,190
sort of combine together to provide like

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,860
a really solid micro framework which

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,210
could then sort of you know be a really

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,190
good sort of launching pad up into

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,680
something like Django or know that other

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,460
more sort of complicated mega frameworks

00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,960
I would love to see the core of some of

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,880
these things put into the standard

00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,280
library so that people don't have to

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,030
keep re-implementing the layer on top of

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,000
the CGI module but beyond that i'm happy

00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,650
for there to be diversity even though it

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,490
does mean that sometimes you might not

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,990
pick exactly the right thing the even

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,310
having the one that's not exactly the

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,160
right thing is still way better than

00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,510
writing itself so i'm happy for there to

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,670
be all this diversity yeah I mean

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,140
there's sort of two sides on the one

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,790
hand I agree there a diversity

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,800
particularly in the early days he's

00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,510
really valuable because you know let a

00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,950
thousand flowers bloom and you find the

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,840
one you find the good ideas they're all

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,770
skill of each other the point of which i

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,140
think that starts to become

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,910
counterproductive is after three or four

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,830
years when the ones that were never good

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,230
ideas to start with kind of died off and

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,810
you're left with two or three major

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,970
contenders who are fundamentally doing

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,680
the same thing in slightly incompatible

00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,570
ways and a bit which then means that

00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,360
you've got duck duplication duplication

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,600
of effort which is essentially what has

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,300
happened with Django terberg is pylons

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,980
like three yes they've got some

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,720
differences but the things that are

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,140
similar about those frameworks is bigger

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,450
than the things that make them different

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,790
arbic the dylan made this come he also

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,190
used the example of the pre Cambrian

00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,360
explosion in biological evolution that

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,960
there is a period there was a period in

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,970
Earth's his

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,320
we're there with the Precambrian

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,630
explosion happened there were thousands

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,910
and thousands of new species and most of

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,460
them died off and we're left with sort

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:57,040
of the 12 basic body forms all human or

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,650
all life on earth were developed during

00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,340
that pre Cambrian explosion we have been

00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:05,230
through the explosion period of the

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,970
Django turbo years era and now the micro

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,640
framework hero I think we need to start

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,450
looking at the consolidation bit and you

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,300
know there are how many how many

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,500
different ways do we need to implement a

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,660
HTTP request and a response object

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,420
before we say we're duplicating

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,820
everything I think you know the it's the

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,830
job of the core developers of Django and

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,540
and parent p removing pylons and my

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,190
daughter's or to say well yeah okay

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,140
let's see what we can share off each

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,760
other and you know yes make our routing

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,800
module something you can use and you

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,440
know make them a lot more compatible and

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,950
integrated the problem with that is it's

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,210
a great idea but who's paying for it you

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,220
know this is this is the open-source

00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,660
polymer that there is a lot of stuff

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,250
that would be really really cool to do

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,380
but I have no spare time left so unless

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,300
someone really gets in foods and drives

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,790
it and presents patches that says here

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,160
you can now deploy Django as a pyramid

00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,980
application or you know whatever it's

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,710
not going to get done because Django

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,600
works and i'm happily using it and it

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,660
would be better if it was if it's shared

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,270
code but there's no dramatic incentive

00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,640
to do it as a you know as an activity

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,840
straight off the bat i think it's a

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,200
little bit hunting to see things like

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,630
pyramid for instance which is where the

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,250
result of bfg and pylons getting

00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,780
together and saying more pylons has hit

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,120
a wall we're going to combine the two

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,790
things talk to each other and create one

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,010
thing so it does happen it's not it's

00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,860
it's not all gloom and doom that yeah

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:36,760
we're going to share stuff

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:39,220
hi I'm an end user of Jango I work

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,090
primarily with the Django web framework

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,720
and typically when I have something that

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:50,500
I can package up that might be useful to

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,049
others I know the standard way of doing

00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,510
this is to take the Python the non

00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:58,210
Django bits and create a Python package

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:00,100
and then if if and then for the rest of

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,549
it if I have something that is very

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,980
specific to you know that that involves

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:08,679
JavaScript and CSS technically I release

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,320
a django package that that has the

00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:15,820
python one as a dependency and i was

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:19,240
wondering is there um so i get a lot of

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,510
complaints about what about why why

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:26,850
can't you why isn't there more reusable

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:30,130
packages across frameworks like why um

00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,530
why do I don't want white Django's yeah

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,020
login doesn't work ramita whiskey and

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,820
it's really hard to I mean it's you

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,919
can't it's not like you can really share

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,700
these types of packages but I I was

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,350
wondering what about maybe uh would you

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:49,830
what would you think of some sort of

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,940
spec to first for a uniform interface

00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,610
III don't know if it would even be

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,559
possible but just curious it's largely a

00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,929
race to the bottom is though is the

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,460
problem because at which level do you

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:01,990
stop trying to be compatible we're

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,660
already compatible on one level which is

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:09,340
the wsgi level you're all its flaws and

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:11,110
wats and stuff but you at the point that

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,000
everything works everywhere you've just

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,679
got one print work right there's no and

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,270
I I don't agree that's time for

00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,919
consolidation everywhere for example

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,080
they're still you know differences

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,179
matter because being fully generic

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,380
trying to be every solution to every

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,790
problem accident leads to something

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,040
there's not quite the right solution for

00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,660
any problem there are arguments to

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,370
specialize I think the other thing is

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,679
that you know to do what you say which

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,720
is to have you know interfaces for each

00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,580
of the different kind of components then

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,780
you will back up the staff where ponens

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,560
which is a very very opinionated

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,940
large amount of AP is too low so the the

00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,230
problem is there's then then you're

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,700
learning all the different API us which

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,110
is fantastic for a company like mine

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,690
that's willing to put the time in and

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,430
then you can create packages that will

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,490
just work in any other plan installation

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,350
and add functionality and I know that

00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,640
Django kind of goes there's pine acts

00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,260
and things like that right where they're

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,860
trying to share bits and pieces of

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,660
features and it's hard because you've

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,270
got to have those very clear interfaces

00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,860
that say what how the features work

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,500
together or what the you know what the

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,290
schema is and so on for those are very

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,000
hard problems to deal with and and the

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,970
trade-off is the learning curve I think

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,530
and it's also you know that if you take

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,300
a problem like you know authentication

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,350
or something like a common user model so

00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,160
everybody knows how to log in well

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,140
you've got to have a database

00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
representation well okay you've just

00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,410
made a decision about whether you're

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,430
going to use the Django RM or sequel

00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:36,350
alchemy or some non-relational store so

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,760
all of a sudden you've got that that's

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,950
an axis on which there is no

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,510
compatibility by definition unless you

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,640
then have a back-end API in your

00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,660
authentication framework to allow people

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,030
to implement you know different

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,800
different storage storage engines so it

00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,300
sort of gets very very complicated

00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,360
because of the things that are just

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,310
different between frameworks that said

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,960
there are areas where I think you know

00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,430
how many like i said before how many

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,890
different implementations of a request

00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,390
and response object do we need and once

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,800
you've got that then yet anything that

00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,740
just relies upon request and response

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,570
could be shared between projects the

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,140
wizard expect and the whiskey you know

00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,670
the whiskey middlewares you can use them

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,530
in Django you can use them in pyramid

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,120
there are some efforts hopefully we'll

00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,680
get landed in drunken jenga are pretty

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,350
soon to make it obvious that you can do

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,440
that we're a lot more obvious that you

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,480
can do that so yeah there are there are

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,490
there are technical reasons why it's

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,100
difficult there are some opportunities

00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,480
for removing some of those technical

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,250
limitations but some of those

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,660
limitations will always exist it's

00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:39,890
because we are different projects so

00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,560
just the last few minutes we go about

00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,030
hitter 9 minutes left I just want to go

00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,590
back to throwing out of it I don't for a

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,080
minute the something else is sort of

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,000
flared up in this space at the I don't

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,510
know the high level or the low level is

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,080
the whole whiskey debate

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,880
kind of opened up again with Richards

00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,530
about it Petty's eyeballs here is he's

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,970
also so far back of it Phillip babies

00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,710
come out of the woodwork and say oh lag

00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,850
all this whiskey fast does not go I

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,260
don't know you guys don't understand

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,030
what i'm doing here is a micro whiskey

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,650
spec which is fully backwards compatible

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,710
with whiskey which my mind doesn't seem

00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,750
to fix the problems at that point me

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,700
make some predictions how does this sort

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,790
of thing Pat out like I have opinions

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,410
and we're not gonna say here but you

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,850
know how does this kind of thing play

00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,640
out over the next little while are we

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,470
are we stuck with whiskey is it is it

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,660
salvageable with a whiskey too or

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,180
whiskey three or whiskey 13 is that we

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,700
need a couple of parallel interfaces two

00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:39,180
things with Richard go for it your date

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,850
is either like I'm not even going to try

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,190
and predict I kind of trust that

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,630
phillippe be gets it right sometimes and

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,710
that you know I'm going to hope that he

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:52,440
gets it right this time as well whiskey

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:56,400
middleware is hard to get right it's

00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,350
really hard to get right but I don't

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,330
think it's doomed it's and the whiskey

00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,030
interface has certainly been very useful

00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,830
in unifying the interface between you

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,650
know the Python applications and the web

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:09,659
servers so it hasn't all been for naught

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,520
and even if musica middleware is given

00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,250
up on wiz gear still useful so given

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,990
that the new efforts are in cleaning

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,490
whiskey up our fully backward compatible

00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:26,389
let's see if it can give us something

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:29,010
new and something better yeah there I

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,379
take a slightly backseat approach here

00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,750
and that I I don't have enough spare

00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,840
cycles as it is so I kind of let the

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,520
whiskey debate go on over there which is

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,710
our slightly embarrassing thing to say

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,220
as a person who's a core developer on a

00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,480
web framework but it's it's a similar

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,669
sort of position to what I do with

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,350
python is a language and again it's also

00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,379
slightly embarrassing to say to say as a

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,889
maintainer of a major Python framework I

00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:57,330
treat Python as a tool I trust that the

00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:59,490
people who are managing the Python

00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,930
project they have a long history of

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,450
demonstrating they know what they're

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,579
doing

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,619
and I'm going to wait to see what comes

00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:07,359
out I don't as much as I would love to

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,980
be involved in it I just don't have

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,599
enough hours in the day as soon as

00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,030
someone invents the time machine that

00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:16,890
lets me have 27 hours of errands the

00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:18,970
time machine Oh giggles so once that

00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,920
happens then yeah sure i'll be loving to

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,579
get involved so i basically relying upon

00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,930
the people who have a vested interest

00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,460
coming up with something that works and

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,990
coming up with an implementation and

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,660
then i'll build against whatever

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,180
implantation they comin they comin for

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,560
my purposes whiskey works as it

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,839
currently stands it does everything that

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,829
I personally need it to do I appreciate

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,170
it doesn't do everything that it needs

00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:43,089
to do I'm waiting for the people who

00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,530
care about the stuff that whiskey

00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,089
doesn't currently solve to fix that

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,780
problem and then I'll do whatever they

00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:52,650
say my polite version of my thoughts

00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,480
given the code of conduct to you is that

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,250
whiskey I mean the best whiskey

00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,410
inflammation implementations around

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,210
including like mod whiskey do not just

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,220
stick to the whiskey spec they actually

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,310
implement things beyond the whiskey spec

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,950
they fill in the unspecified areas to do

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,210
something useful turns out to be useful

00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,550
you can't do certain things in the

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,230
whiskey spec via whiskey I mean you

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,869
can't be spect complying to do things

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,369
like streaming content within an

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:20,200
organization for example you know there

00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,119
are no proxies out there and you want to

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,380
do chunk transfer encoding you're not

00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,760
allowed to do it using whiskey because

00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,880
it explicitly says you can't set

00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,250
transfer headedness for example and i'm

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,640
a bit fearful at only having one gateway

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,980
interface like that is an error because

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,810
we're focusing on a particular use case

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,280
okay very well maybe eighty five percent

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,540
of the people or ninety percent of

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,790
people but it still means the other ten

00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,410
to fifteen percent exist and so in the

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,240
days where we had modern Python or I

00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,940
mean we still do some extent have fast

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,369
CGI but it kind of is ugly and not

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,990
really well supported scg is drifted out

00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,810
of the picture in the last eight or nine

00:36:52,990 --> 00:37:00,760
years it was around with the QT sort of

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:02,050
days it worries me a bit that way it's

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,579
not just we're saying you know there are

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,380
other alternatives for those other ten

00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:06,849
percent we may be saying there are no

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,990
alternative so those other ten percent

00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,010
and someone's got to someone's going to

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,060
reinvent scg I and

00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,250
two or three years out of desperation

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,260
here or something I'm particularly

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,750
thinking for internal corporate cases

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,310
not necessarily public public internet

00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,380
cases where you've got a lot more

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:26,450
control over the end-to-end stuff using

00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,710
HTTP as a restful transfer mechanism it

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,860
was a lot less controversial than your

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,600
pretty clear I got to be Richard I have

00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:37,520
emails and we will probably spend most

00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:41,620
of the panel talking about this so I am

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:46,280
wrong saw something I'm pretty much done

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:47,690
it fled briefly in our body game alright

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,560
so got time for one more question yes

00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:55,040
she gets a chance I am introduced myself

00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,970
I'm named hot cold i founded gilgit

00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,560
coffees which is trying to get the

00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:04,040
students to network with each other and

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,790
hence you will see hopefully more girls

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,560
here and a bit more to be able to chat

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:15,200
to them and have the input my what was

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,700
established this morning in a girl's

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,760
programming network because there's

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,640
basically not enough high school

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,490
teachers that know how to program and

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,080
therefore you can actually teach the

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,400
guys all the girls in high school

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,110
programming this is a bit of a concern

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,750
if you want like you know more girls

00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:38,270
around one of the things that they do

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:41,270
kind of this seems a bit more bit more

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,040
of a movement towards a web so girls

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,150
might actually pick up weds bit more

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:51,110
socially acceptable my my question is

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:54,140
about if you can use do more funky

00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:57,580
things with Python in the web you know

00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:00,500
how can we actually use that to actually

00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:04,190
you know as a plug and play so that they

00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:09,110
can scale up in that area in programming

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:10,610
so I may I have two more what my mother

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,860
and my mother and Laura both teachers so

00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,440
I kind of my my my answer here is

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,790
slightly tinted by what I know they were

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,830
what I suspect they would probably tell

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,240
me if I asked is that they need the

00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,700
teaching materials to tell them how to

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,530
do it

00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,780
like what they actually need to be

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,579
taught trained how to do it and then

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,700
they need the syllabus and the the

00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:32,130
workbook and though you know the

00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,750
developing course materials is hard so

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,369
the course materials need to exist not

00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,020
necessarily just giving them a and here

00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:38,400
is the course to teach but there are the

00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,720
source materials that let them know

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,250
what's a good idea and what sort of

00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,349
projects you should do and how do you

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:49,619
break that up over a 12-week semester or

00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:51,770
whatever so and yeah and making it back

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,609
to you know the curriculum or the the

00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,140
education outcomes or whatever it is

00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:58,920
they've got a hit in order to you know

00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,660
make their their their key performance

00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,140
indicators for the further education

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,520
requirements so if essentially that is

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,020
something that that needs to be

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,760
developed I think Zed Shores got a

00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,079
really good job with learn python the

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,940
hard ways you know here is a book that

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,250
takes you from nothing to building a

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,660
really primitive website and it's cool

00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,910
you know it's like you can easily you

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,650
could give this to a student work them

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:23,520
through it and they've just built our

00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,619
website on the internets there is plenty

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,210
of room to build volume to volume three

00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,859
of that and she put it on a mobile phone

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,450
and here's your kids from playing with a

00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,609
mobile phone on the internets and you

00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,200
know it comes down to building the

00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:35,880
course materials I think and that's an

00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,260
extension of the documentation issue is

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,119
that you cannot you can never have

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,280
enough tutorials and another another

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,319
enough in-depth walkthroughs and what

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,150
have you I think something like App

00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:47,609
Engine has a huge scope of that I mean

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,900
it's it's so you know it's particularly

00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:51,569
you've got the mac install where you can

00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,940
just go green button deploy it's so

00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:55,020
immediate and then you can you've got

00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,490
all the logs and everything like that

00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,050
you can see what's going on I think

00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,420
there's a lot of scope there probably is

00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:03,329
already tutorials aimed at high school

00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,910
students around that I think it sounds

00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:09,450
more like a syllabus issue yeah chinita

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,000
demins the the easy you know the plug

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,560
and play version of them actually how

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,260
they can directly implement it in there

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,910
and the course materials and and also to

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,060
learn it themselves more importantly

00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:23,099
because then I had a program so there's

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,869
a breaking the damage due to with sort

00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,700
of anything new getting it on the radar

00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:28,410
and getting it accepted as credible and

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,940
worth the investment of time is always a

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,369
hard thing

00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,589
and so you know someone has to be brave

00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:35,210
/ stupid enough / not concentrating

00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:38,589
enough to sort of sign up and say okay

00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,660
try this out no crap it's great let's go

00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:43,520
all right so our time is up so thank you

00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,329
to the three people who SAT there and

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,329
