hey so for the people who aren't

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,580
familiar with the lightning talk format

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,350
that's pretty simple you got five

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,970
minutes to project and talk about

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,530
something that you think might be

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,059
interesting you get five minutes and

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,110
five minutes only at the end of the five

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,619
minutes it doesn't matter if you're

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,180
interesting you get stopped and if you

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,760
want to talk about it more there's beer

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,880
afterwards and there's dinner so it's

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:30,960
okay will tell you okay alright so first

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:35,989
up with zombies on maps cool all right

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,920
give me all right some I'm Saxon and I'm

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,820
going to talk a bit about class three

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,379
outbreak which is a game I've been

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,790
working on in my spare time the last

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,680
couple of years with a friend of mine so

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm the I'm the programmer and he's the

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,140
artist doing all the work live it up so

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,660
I'll start with a bit of a demo so it's

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,949
a game based on google maps and we allow

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,110
people to create their own their own

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,030
maps wherever they want in the world so

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,539
these markers show you where people have

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,160
created maps and so there's you know

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,379
obviously a bunch in the u.s. a lot of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,380
people there but i'll go over to where

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:13,229
we've got some here in sydney and we

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,880
mean so we've got this map here which is

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:22,909
just in our hard part so if i play that

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,909
one hopefully the Wi-Fi was working well

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,250
so it's basically if I click play it's

00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,649
basically an RTS a real-time strategy

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,439
game based on google maps let's turn off

00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,609
the music so you've got um civilians

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,960
running around zombies running around

00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,969
attacking the civilians and you've got a

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,659
small group of people you can can

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:44,659
control like this so if I come up here

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:58,829
put on the shotgun dispatch a few

00:01:47,729 --> 00:02:00,329
zombies so on yeah so that's pretty

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,310
simple game but anyway so that's we've

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,509
got this editor in here so people want

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,289
to create their own map they come in

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:16,530
here create their own map we can type in

00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:19,319
up the leave my mouse so this is

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,569
obviously where we are now this building

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,250
just there so I could create a map here

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,639
but instead of that ol here's one I

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,920
prepared earlier this is a map of a

00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,840
different area but basically the idea is

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,220
so do the game knows where the walls and

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,900
things are you have to use this editor

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,350
to draw and I read four walls green for

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,690
trees things like that so you know you

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,160
can draw stuff and things like that but

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,660
that's essentially it so we've we've

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
released this version with the editor

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,859
back in April and since then we've had

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,569
about 4,000 maps created by people the

00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:50,040
game itself with release versions over

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,220
the last 4 18 months has been played

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,120
about 2 million times so I guess the

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,829
question is what does this have to do

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,799
with Python so the front-end desire is

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,900
all the action script so runs in flash

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,090
but the back end of it is running on

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,980
running in Python on App Engine so so

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,120
that's what it has to do with Python so

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,889
I start I basically started learning

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,459
python about a year ago just to just to

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,500
do this so i guess the nice thing about

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,840
App Engine is it scales automatically so

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,549
we've got about six thousand fans on

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,109
Facebook and people on our forums and

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,549
blogs and so every couple of weeks had a

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,569
new update and this is an update and put

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,290
out about a week ago when I put the

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:26,819
shotguns in and you know our usual usual

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,169
average is about one request a second

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,239
and a picture about two or three

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,370
requests a second when we put that out

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,689
for her for a few days and so I don't

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,950
have to worry about scaling or anything

00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,060
like that which is a big

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,440
Francois we first released the first

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,060
version who got onto the front page of

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,739
digg back when dig was still popular in

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,209
a crashed and dedicated service so don't

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:53,310
have to worry about that stuff anymore

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:54,989
so that's cool back in April so I guess

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,280
yeah we made this version with our

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,510
Prince William and Kate Middleton in it

00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,310
released just a couple of days before

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,780
the wedding and we've got featured on

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,430
gizmodo and a bunch of other websites

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,049
and I'm I think our traffic peaked at

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,310
about five or six requests a second so

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,640
across a few days there we go about

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,110
45,000 plays of the game and yet it app

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,040
engine charges about eight dollars for

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,510
that so not too much for worry so the

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,919
one sort of 2 pi have about App Engine

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,389
is it you should expect failure so

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,470
pretty much everything should have made

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,299
that big a bit i'm pretty much

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,419
everything does fail sometimes like

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,310
whatever you trying to do and so and

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,590
often writes fail more often than reads

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,120
and all rights are also slower than

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,350
reads so as much as possible if you've

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,780
got something to write push it to a

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,820
background task but also adding things

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,590
to tasks will also sometimes fail so i

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,169
tend to use this pattern where when i

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,210
add something to a task i am you know

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,250
put it in a try catch or try except and

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,720
then if for this particular one it's not

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,860
critical so i just log a message and

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,389
then user doesn't have to care that it

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,800
actually failed and i don't care too

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,960
much if i lose a little bit of data and

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,060
a good example of this was just

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,190
happening yesterday i'm from path for

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,900
our flight here the good thing about you

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,180
know it's kind of annoying that that it

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,770
does fail sometimes but it's to be

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,600
realistic you know every software fails

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,039
and the nice thing about it is when it

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,539
does fail google fixes it i don't have

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,430
to sit there fixing a so as an example i

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,200
was on the plane when I got here I found

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,180
out that app engine had a sort of big

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,440
data store failure yesterday and by the

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,030
time I actually read about it was

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,979
already fixed so I didn't have to be

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,639
worrying about it so I'm in that's it

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,639
thank

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,210
this is awesome I've organized the

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,980
speakers so they know what they're doing

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:36,730
it's great next up we've got Oh can know

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:49,150
any software patents coalition excellent

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:51,670
I make the funny sounds I folks my

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,110
name's Ben thankfully it's that time of

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,570
day so I'm not going to tell you about

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,480
software patents because it's more time

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,000
to go to the pub apart from a couple of

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,370
things it's generally considered that

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,280
they're bad for a bad fit for software

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,090
and you guys all do software so these

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,420
affect you about a year and a half ago

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,180
in July I I'm just a software developer

00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,810
I got we were getting heckled by the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,870
Irish guy Kieran Oh reordon who does a

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,810
lot of patent work and I figured it was

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,150
time to pick this up so I am and a few

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,340
other Melbourne people started a

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,320
campaign on software patents and we've

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,350
we've done an online letter and a

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,000
petition to the federal government and

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,710
you guys are probably seen me at some

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,320
stage you're being hassled by me at a

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,440
conference or something like that it's

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,330
actually surprising how you know the the

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,520
the political process I'm not a I'm not

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,500
an activist or anything by any means but

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,200
um people are interested in listening to

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,120
what the masses actually think about

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,910
this sort of thing so we can actually

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,740
affect change here so i just wanted to

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,890
tell you about the next thing that we're

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,410
looking at doing and this is a coalition

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,930
modeled on what new zealand did to get

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,730
their successful abolition of software

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,230
patents or the legislation going up for

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:16,420
that it's a it's a coalition of people

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,740
of organizations and projects who are

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,220
interested in supporting this campaign

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,690
and being publicly seen to support it so

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,730
minimally all I'm asking for people to

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,200
do is to let me know that their

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,020
organization is happy for me to put up

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,750
their logo and their name on our website

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,830
basically because I think all we need is

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,710
to just make this tide visit

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,870
all of how much we don't like software

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,250
patents and we can actually affect some

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,730
change and I don't expect it to happen

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,430
tomorrow or in the next year or two but

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,500
it will happen after you know long-term

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,540
work on it so please come and have a

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,740
chat to me that's the website down there

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,260
and send me an email if your

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,300
organization or project is interested in

00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:33,560
participating so it'll only happened

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:41,540
with your support thanks guys this is

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:43,880
not about me yeah hi I'm Cody Lovett I'm

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:47,570
14 years old and have been programming

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,760
in Python for about three years so this

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,490
talk is going to be about pie week which

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,270
is a game programming competition that

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,750
I've been in twice so far and yeah

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,030
basically you have one week it's called

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,330
PO week and you have one week to write a

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:09,100
game in Python and to do with a topic

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:12,800
that is set by you and your competitors

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,770
so in pie week I have made a few

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,570
mistakes and I've learnt quite a bit as

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:23,480
well and so this is my first pie week so

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,060
basically you're this little blue blob

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,140
and you've just got to escape this evil

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,900
prison place thing and so some of the

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,090
problems with it was that you had to

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,720
repeatedly click the arrow keys to move

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:42,620
and so that was kinda annoying and also

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,540
when you moved I used made it wait so

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,480
that it would have a little animation of

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,820
you moving and so that meant

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,010
that when you move other objects would

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:57,220
just slow down for a while and so this

00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:01,209
one's my second one so this was in

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,320
February I think and so this time I

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:08,529
figured out how to use images in PI game

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,920
and so then I made this little guy and

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:17,350
so you basically had to move around to

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,970
go and save the princess and and so this

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,130
one I fixed the repeated key press and

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,660
so instead of having to repeatedly click

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,639
you just tailed it down and I moved

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:33,519
which was awesome and so although with

00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:39,459
this one I learned a lot which meant

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:43,600
that there were a few more errors and so

00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:48,880
basically whenever you flew this portal

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:52,000
thing started to flicker and yet that I

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,420
also still used waiting for everything

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,490
and so it was kind of slow and also

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,790
using images meant that thing's drew

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,860
over the top and everything was a bit

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,740
harder and so the next pie week is on

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,810
the 11th starts on the 11th September

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,800
and I hope to see a lot of you there

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,800
thanks

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,450
okay I can eat cheese I'm made self

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:35,210
introducing speaker yeah I'm Polly party

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,030
from our Anu I just wanted to talk about

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:42,050
what it is that I'm doing currently so

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:45,290
I'm lecturing a subject called matrix

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,030
computation at had a nu at the moment

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,890
and we've got a class of about 30

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,750
students 30 students come from a

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,810
reasonably diverse background either a

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:57,200
survey i think maybe seventy eighty

00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,900
percent of them are mathematicians or

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,380
budding mathematicians they're from

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,390
third year through two masters some of

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,770
them have very little linear algebra and

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,890
knowledge and very little mathematical

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,770
knowledge some are very oriented towards

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,560
pure mathematics some have no

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,380
programming knowledge at all some are

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,000
very very much programming oriented and

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,230
have backgrounds in multiple different

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,150
languages they're all being taught in

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,350
Python and they're all being expected to

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:33,980
write programs in in Python using numpy

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:37,160
and sci-fi and matplotlib this

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,040
environment has only really been used we

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,230
are once before in an undergraduate

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,720
course that I knew and that is in first

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,560
semester by linda's tools so it's all

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,270
very new to us the environment in which

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,410
we were programming look for the last

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,960
few years has been scilab and if you

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,960
know about celeb you know that it's a

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,510
matlab non clone it's trying to be like

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,540
MATLAB enough so that you need to know

00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,610
about matlab but not so much that you

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:12,020
can actually use matlab syntax when you

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,790
write in silo so it's a pain so i'm just

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,520
removed everything from that particular

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,800
pain to the pain of having everybody

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,280
trying to understand how to do

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,950
everything pythonic Lee and zero based

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,640
arrays when all of our text books are

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,410
written for one based matrices and

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,540
including the specific textbook that

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,440
were actually using at the moment

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,000
so the main challenges that I have

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,370
getting people on non-programmers to

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,800
think programa CLE programmatically at

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:47,810
all secondly using things like specific

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,340
programming oriented concepts such as

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:55,760
whole logic such as weakest precondition

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,250
for loop invariants those things to

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,440
analyze algorithms taking their analysis

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,720
of algorithms taking that to a level

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,610
where they can nulla understand what the

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,380
code should be doing at a computer

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,880
science law but understanding what it

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,510
should be doing in a mathematical though

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,680
being able to prove things about it

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,890
getting people to be comfortable about

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,960
both proofs and programming getting

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,870
people to be comfortable about how to

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,190
approximate things and what I ideally

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,720
like is get these people to be

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,110
comfortable about working in small

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,790
groups in a situation where met in

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,890
mathematics especially it's all

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,200
individualistic and very competition

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,210
oriented so if anybody can talk to me

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,000
about any of these topics either during

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,500
up during the pub break or dinner I'd be

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,500
very appreciative thanks very much

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,330
okay I'll introduce you this time all

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,050
right we've got Dylan talking about

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,580
plone 4.1 later a fit no it says better

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,440
faster lighter here you've got lighter

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:22,110
faster better there okay it's not right

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,520
sorry wrong taught wrong foot so my

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,160
company does a lot of playing stuff and

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,480
I was too busy doing the other talks and

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,800
I thought I well there was no other

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,360
phone talks on the things i'll do a

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,470
lightning talk unfortunately i'm using

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,480
slides from an hour long presentation

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:40,320
i'm going to try and fit that in 25

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:42,330
minutes so this one here this is a

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,770
really complicated way of saying that

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,540
CMS is are different than light wave

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,370
frameworks they have pros and cons

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,470
they're two different things if someone

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,980
says to you Django CMS and it does where

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,270
CMS is it doesn't it's different like

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,980
web frameworks are good for doing apps

00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,300
CMS is when you're going to manage a lot

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,660
of content you want to hand it over to

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:05,610
people who don't know how to program so

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,890
this is what plone looks like out of the

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,900
box so anyone who's had experience with

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,430
point before it's changed the way it

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,320
looks as a whole bunch of things have

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,440
changed so this is what plan for looks

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,180
like out of the box this is where I do a

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,510
long demo and show the features I'm

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,240
nothing to do that this is really

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,930
interesting vendor looking at all the

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,220
different vendors here's climb down you

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,500
what are interesting things about it is

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,990
that it crosses three of the different

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,320
areas and there's not many in there that

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:41,190
actually managed to do three different

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,660
aspects of CMS's in there you'll notice

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,040
that some of them across many of them

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,240
are the big vendors actually had

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,260
multiple products pointers one product

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,360
here's another way of looking employment

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,970
there's WordPress out the first insanely

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,430
popular WordPress but then if you look

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,190
at the top ten thousand sites clones

00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,630
quite fly out there it is actually very

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,630
popular some very big sites

00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:10,270
so who are these people things like

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:13,179
front page of CIA and FBI that's all

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:16,689
point 13 15 hundred site that a lot of

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:19,750
people might use that plan we're doing

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:21,579
some local government sites doing things

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,709
like Victorian AC is really good for

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:28,059
scalability intranets who knows how many

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,890
internets are out there a lot of people

00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,440
use a plan for internets we do work with

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:36,820
that because you can't measure it so

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:41,080
easily it's hard to tell I don't know

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,490
why yeah okay that's good yeah so anyway

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,630
the thing behind there is the really

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,010
really cool but I want to talk about

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,059
which is thing called planet ploughed

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,830
net now plowed net is a online SAS

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:55,210
service that you can go up and sign up

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:57,520
to a get a plain sight right now and in

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,230
fact we Adam who gave a demo earlier

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,450
about do so it says new theming

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,000
technology they include that in there

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,590
and his original demo didn't work about

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,230
an hour before the talk he signed up to

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:13,630
a ploughed dotnet he created a plone

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:16,270
instance he grabbed a copy of the pike

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,670
on website he uploaded it with a rules

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,520
file with the days 0 NE handed themed

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:26,050
version of plone running in about an

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,490
hour so plug clone does it scale one of

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,450
the cool things that's going on is

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,850
there's a lot of restructuring

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,980
underneath so there's a cool graph which

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,800
i don't have which talks about the code

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,750
count dropping in flown you know kicking

00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,070
out bits and pieces they've refactored a

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,780
lot of things what they tried to do is

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,550
go from all technology to a new

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,640
technology without changing much on the

00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,190
top most of that's done already but

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,670
anyway outer-box performance if you

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,720
don't you know optimize anything clients

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,720
pretty damn fast now

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,790
security is big thing around plane we do

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,870
a lot with government stuff you know I

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,760
mentioned a CIA and FBI before you might

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,860
have heard that they got hacked they

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,360
didn't get hacked the FBI site was

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,400
actually a wordpress site not the main

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,540
site in the CIA was a denial of service

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,760
attack so if you look back at those

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:23,890
figures there that's a little bit of a

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,510
comparison of vulnerabilities of a plone

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:30,870
versus some of the other popular CMS's

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,870
out there makes you reflect a little bit

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:39,190
so that was the days of stuff I was

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:41,110
talking about before lets you make

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,840
really nice that sites very fast and

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,910
lets you leave the theme intact so your

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,280
designer can work on the theme as HTML

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,810
and CSS and doesn't mean that you have

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,070
to take it apart and template it some

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,260
very cool things happening in plone

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,950
coming up there's things like CMS UI and

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:03,160
deco drag and drop blocks moving things

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,940
around they're pretty cool chameleons

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,160
which is very speed increases there's a

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,810
plane community it's a bit about the

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,560
plant community house Prince happen

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:16,560
there's a conference coming up yeah blah

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:26,310
oh we're hiring by the way

00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:55,269
I got to stop doing that all right sorry

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:59,289
now we're going to hear about Highsmith

00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:03,220
widow and in visual effects with Sam as

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:08,169
soon as it's Sarah it says oh it's badly

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,729
written yeah she didn't write this it's

00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:15,639
not her fault no but on the way for it

00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:17,979
it's probably horse um ok so I'm a

00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:20,529
production engineer intern at what a

00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:23,950
digital who you might know from Lord of

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:27,820
the Rings or avatar or Planet of the

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:29,139
Apes recently and I'm working as in the

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,450
production engineering department which

00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:33,879
is the pipeline so with visual effects

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,440
you have so many different layers of the

00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,440
process and just hundreds of people

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,580
working on it and our job is to be the

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,210
duct tape and the yeah but it sums it up

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,619
and so one of the things that we so I'm

00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,720
actually not a hundred percent sure what

00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:57,609
I'm allowed to tell you guys about what

00:21:49,720 --> 00:22:01,570
we do so but I I know so how many people

00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:02,950
here have used twisted ok cool so yeah

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,499
so basically all of our pipeline

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,149
engineering is in Python there's a lot

00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:10,239
of leftover pearl stuff but since I got

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,979
there we just do Python and so um just

00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:13,490
so I don't know any pearl so I'm glad

00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:15,650
but

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:19,370
so one of the things we do with twisted

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,870
is event-driven programming and if

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,850
you've never used twisted before you

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,990
know that it can be really weird or if

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,250
you have you assisted before you know

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,140
it's really weird sometimes when you get

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,370
errors you don't know like where to go

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,690
like you're just like whatever so one of

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,220
the things that we found really useful

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,960
is a unit testing and there's this

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,860
package called trial which makes it

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,470
really easy so I'm going to show you how

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,380
to write some unit tests using trap so

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,270
yeah so here's you've got your module

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,720
and then unit test that's all you got it

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:58,790
import and then so bear with me for my

00:22:50,720 --> 00:23:00,260
presentation style okay um so you can

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,480
have your setup method which is like

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,630
standard for unit testing and with

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,410
twisted you use deferred and deferred is

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:11,929
basically mean it's a deferred result so

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,130
what you're going to get it later so the

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,050
way you deal with deferred Zyzz you add

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,640
callbacks to them and then once the

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,080
wants the reactors the rafter goes and

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,300
spins and it waits for a result and then

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,520
like once it gets the result it fires

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,260
the callbacks on that result so when you

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,350
actually write your tests you have to

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,580
write them using callbacks so inside

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,590
your tests you have your callback and

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,980
then you can assert equals or whatever

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,260
and then at the end of your test you

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,000
have to add the callback to your defer

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,960
so that's all you gotta do but then

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,670
there's some cool things you can do a

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,440
trial and so like say you have your

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,580
second test and you're not really done

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,920
writing it but you know that you're

00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,240
going to want to test it at some point

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,929
so you can make it turn into what to do

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:59,870
to do or you can go gonna have to scroll

00:23:53,929 --> 00:24:01,370
down you can also say you have you don't

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,320
want the test to pass yet because maybe

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,940
you know like maybe you were you know

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,460
fear deferred doesn't return them like

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,900
your that's probably a bad example but

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,190
say you have something that if you don't

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,230
get it or it comes back as none or

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,429
something then you're going to skip this

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,190
test because otherwise this test will

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:21,410
fail and so you can add that skip test

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:23,750
and lastly oh there's just another way

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,429
to skip test so all right so that's like

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,080
your introduction to testing trial or

00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,730
testing twisted using trial and then you

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,340
just run it from the command line so you

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,980
would just say trial and then whatever

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,050
your module is or no trial and then your

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,270
test module and then I'm you get this

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,760
sort of pretty output but that is not

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,050
representative of anything because this

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:54,860
test doesn't actually test anything so

00:24:42,050 --> 00:25:00,370
there's but you'd get past this you're

00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:04,940
an excellent Oh Python and science love

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,860
so good just just before you start my

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,590
timer

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:11,080
I got a second I gotta take come on come

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:21,190
on come on all right everyone everyone

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:24,460
will everyone be awesome cool all right

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,710
python and science love so firstly some

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,450
context from a company called ccg over

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,420
in Perth it's a scent of a comparative

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,910
genomics and we do genomics analysis

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,559
assembly annotation alignment sequencing

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:39,160
metabolomics protein expression cell

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,070
biology I'm not a biologist I'm just a

00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,840
computer guy but an example research

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,910
area is like week ancestry like wheat

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,340
has a huge long ancestry and we breed

00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,799
all sorts of different types of wheat

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,890
trying to create like a super

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:56,650
Frankenstein week right and this is for

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,450
the benefit of mankind and look there's

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,070
there are many more research areas this

00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,360
is just one tiny little slice oh I'm

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,669
going really fast cuz I've got a lots of

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,250
slides but I'm a programmer I'm not a

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,340
biologist but the challenge is to do

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,330
with scientists because in the beginning

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,290
scientists the non computing type

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:17,799
they're quite unhappy and the reason is

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:19,360
firstly that is data science and this is

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,450
important right science is important

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,150
secondly they can have awesome hair like

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,910
this guy his ADA Lovelace's hair

00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,890
evolution check her out she's a program

00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:32,830
pioneer and paved the way for Star Wars

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,270
hairstyles and there's also mustaches as

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,230
well as the cheeky and the blue steals

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,230
Nikola Tesla

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,410
I can't say that the last guy is

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,490
actually scientist but is pushing the

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,590
boundaries so I'm going to include him

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,600
anyway so the third thing though about

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,400
scientists is they collect data holy

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,040
 they collect data they are freaking

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,980
experts are collecting data so why is

00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,410
this panda doing this to this kid

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:58,140
surprise it's a frickin scientist right

00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,910
so they've got a to collection King down

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,860
pat right and if you let them they will

00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,410
just collect massive amounts of data

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,430
right there's lots of fields around that

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,590
are generating huge amounts of data

00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,590
Geoscience astronomy chemistry bio for

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,090
Maddux particle physics massage science

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,230
actually they all do like just just

00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,210
anyone that you can think of that

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,120
there's lots of data in there right and

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,690
so here's another thing we know

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,670
computers this is this is not really I

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,560
don't even know what that is the other

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:31,350
thing is the other thing is super

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,940
computers never forget about those so

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,320
traditionally see this is the problem

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,240
right and it was kind of talked about

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,160
earlier and by married it scientists

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,300
will start a project PhD project and

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,590
they never let me find this often that

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,750
they want to use that they assumed

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,520
exists it doesn't exist or does exist in

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,580
it's crap so they decide to write it

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,280
themselves this is a bad move right they

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,040
did there they did that there's work in

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,780
chemistry and we did our work in in in

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,610
programming so you get the worst of both

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,770
worlds their science suffers and they

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,780
write terrible terrible software causes

00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,700
a lot of grief the point is that

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,810
scientists aren't necessarily program is

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,070
and they shouldn't have to be so

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,080
meanwhile there's programmers right

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,120
and here's the solution so we believe

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,380
where i'm from that rather than a jack

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,820
of all trades master of none yin should

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,809
be the master of your domain if you're a

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,580
signed foreperson you know what that

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,490
means it's not the master of my domain

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:21,919
name it's more like this I do what you

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,269
do and do it well so you let scientists

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,230
do science you let programs do

00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,870
programming and then we're all rock

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,970
stars so the CCG we have a seam of super

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,250
programmers we use a lot of Python and a

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,630
lot of useful tech twisted and memcache

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,519
and took your cabinet all these cool

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,500
things you can do with Python we take

00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,389
huge intimately linked data sets and we

00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,539
make them available to program to

00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:42,830
scientists in a very flexible way so we

00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,210
do a lot of things web-based we target

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,129
the web makes globally accessible very

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,960
flexible in terms of house displayed we

00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,149
have massive display walls then display

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,539
all this type of data powered by like

00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:55,909
nine projectors and in terms of Python

00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:57,379
we like Django we bred it with my co

00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,029
which is a templating system and a whole

00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,799
bunch of other customizations and we

00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:03,259
made mango and we put that uncle google

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,879
code and using that power we we can

00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,279
solve problems so a massive metabolite

00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:10,700
repository that has a large curated list

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,710
of metabolites here they are there's a

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,029
whole bunch of stuff just different

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,200
stuff that's come off a mass spec

00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,850
machine and salt in a whole big

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,230
searchable database but what the hell is

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,490
this what if you just have something you

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,529
don't even know what it is you've just

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,929
fed into a matrix mass spec machine and

00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:26,179
said tell me what this is so we had to

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,460
have an answer for that and using Django

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,980
and took a cabinet and a whole bunch of

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,169
numpy and siphon we worked out how they

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,929
can identify the mystery compounds we

00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,360
also built an end-to-end data

00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:40,879
distribution data to distributed

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,379
experimental design system and this

00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,519
allows them to do experimental design

00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:45,080
and then all their mass spec machines

00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,549
sink their data back to their website

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,049
from wherever they are and in Australia

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:49,940
but don't forget the supercomputers we

00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:51,799
have XE which has a whole bunch of cores

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,960
and disks and flops and we have epic

00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,669
which has even more this thing's massive

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,350
this is a barrier to entry though

00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,539
because the scientists need to talk

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,650
about mustaches so what we did was we

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,240
brought ya be

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,850
allows them to just drag and drop a

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,140
workflow of tools run their jobs and

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,000
let's see their result they don't have

00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,740
to do any programming at all problem

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,410
solved scientists get their stuff done

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,550
they're happy they're in love thanks

00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,550
Python and I'm done

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:48,060
that's how this works yes mom oh there

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,060
we go cool

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,620
hmm ok so I'm going to be talking about

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,480
philosophy and other related things so

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,890
this guy he is names Bobby McFerrin he

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,630
sang a song in the 80s called don't

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,220
worry be happy I think that's a pretty

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:10,350
good philosophy that's the end of my

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,390
talk no it's not a couple of months ago

00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,039
a friend of mine alerted me to the

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,429
existence of one of his albums on

00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:19,980
Twitter and as a standard computer geek

00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:22,590
when i get find something interesting I

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,600
go straight to wikipedia and and browse

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,400
things for about half an hour and there

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,370
he is he's very easy to find us went to

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,960
his Wikipedia page and I started

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,020
clicking around for about 10 minutes and

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,080
then this happened wikipedia stopped

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,470
working and zero my entire life of God

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,450
was upside down in an instant this is

00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,789
absolutely a true story it happened in

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,190
May and you can tell this is a true

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:52,740
story because two days later some other

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:54,419
nerd published a webcomic and yeah I

00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,850
thought this webcomic was good and

00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,549
there's a tooltip on it which said if

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,530
you follow the first useful link in a

00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:04,500
Wikipedia article you'll eventually come

00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:08,760
across the article on philosophy and I

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,020
thought this is interesting really um so

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,330
I pondered the bottle of mineral water

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,400
on my desk and I thought that's going to

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,520
have a Wikipedia page isn't it so I went

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,940
to that and I fired the first link which

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,419
there's brand and I that and I followed

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,549
that I went to identity and oh I got

00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,980
there in four links and this completely

00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:32,250
and utterly astonished me really is this

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,260
and so I figured it would be a good idea

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,610
to investigate this how would I go about

00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,010
doing this well I could have done a

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,159
massive amount of manual data entry or I

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,530
could code myself some Python and so I I

00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,570
got confused by trying to figure out how

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,290
to get all the data out of Wikipedia

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,640
until I discovered that Wikimedia is

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,620
Wikimedia is maintenance code and

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,030
they're bought for putting in stub

00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,530
articles and such like that is all

00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,260
written in Python and they have this

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,380
program called pay me wikipedia bot

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,140
which is a bot for getting stuff out of

00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:07,180
Wikipedia and there's a another platen

00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:10,870
library called MW live which can pass

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,700
wiki markup from from Wikimedia wikis so

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,920
basically I came up with a solution

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,780
which would be to download a page find

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,640
all the appropriate links follow the

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,710
first one and repeat this and then

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,210
produce a graph now understand that some

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,030
you have a computer science background

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,070
so this is just depth-first search you

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,480
should be able to recognize it so I

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:34,900
started with a list of completely

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:37,300
unrelated articles and I output my graph

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,880
in a format called dot which basically

00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,140
you give it this sort of data and it

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,960
produces a graph that looks like that

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,600
and there are tools out there which can

00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,670
you know take take the data and make a

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,220
graph out of it I use one called graph

00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,720
is and that article gave us something

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,400
that looked like that as you can see

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,080
it's kind of a tree it starts at the top

00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,900
and at the bottom there is our

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,420
philosophy article but there are other

00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,490
clustering points this one on science is

00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,620
apparently very important and at the top

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,169
there's this concept of a state or a

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,510
nation or something like that so I

00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:12,990
decided to start off with a list of 2300

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,760
start pages I accidentally downloaded

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:19,240
2.43 gigs worth of text that was a bit

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,129
of a mistake um and I ended up with that

00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,070
graph and you can see everything that is

00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:26,440
happening can't you there's our article

00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,530
on state and there's philosophy down

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,960
there and there's where my home broke up

00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,330
in the corner um that tree is really

00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,909
hard to read there's a another program

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,200
that comes with graphic is called nieto

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,600
which allows you to do something called

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,179
force reduce graphs which basically

00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,980
makes sub graphs of a graph cluster and

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,389
clustering points and you get something

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,369
that looks like that and there's our

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,099
state and there's our philosophy

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:55,809
and so I basically decided I'd graph it

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:59,059
and keep on adding more and more points

00:34:55,809 --> 00:35:04,789
and so that's what Wikipedia looks like

00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:08,980
guys and that's with all about all 2300

00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:08,980
links put in so thank

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,420
hi my name is Caleb Caleb often I'm from

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,569
sunshine coast originally from New

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,569
Zealand please don't hold it against me

00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:34,819
i'm working at optus which is like

00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:37,569
telecom back in New Zealand who I worked

00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:39,410
for for a little under two years doing

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:41,720
multi-million dollar projects here which

00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:44,770
is really cool rolling out a DSL to all

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:49,460
of our local town folk well and the wops

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:52,069
optus is way way bigger far more

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,819
bureaucratic which means being someone

00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:56,839
on the phone dealing with customers

00:35:54,819 --> 00:36:01,400
everything's like a programmer is

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,950
extremely painful I been there for a

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,480
little over a year and a half and

00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,700
decided that there's a lot of stuff that

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,559
can be automated so I did the really

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,079
foolish thing and talk to my teammates

00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,569
and said what's something you hate doing

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,930
and I'll try and automate it so they

00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:20,930
have this process called a Cir which is

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:26,359
a customer information report so they

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:28,369
get a PDF document which is where data

00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:32,539
goes to die not my quote someone else's

00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:34,819
and it's from a in-house tool so while

00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:38,119
they can't use something useful like XML

00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:41,750
or word or even just text I don't know

00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,910
but anyway all it's got tool tips which

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,710
they're allowed to show to the customer

00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,819
and there's lots of information in there

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,670
that they're not allowed to throw to the

00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:53,380
customer so they manually go through

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:57,410
this PDF document and cut and paste

00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,380
right so and there's about seven

00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,059
different customers that for priority

00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,440
ones they have to do priority 2 is if

00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:05,539
it's requested they have to do it and

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,890
it's things like customer names customer

00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,750
contacts phone numbers they're not

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,390
allowed to show these and there's a

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,809
specific job type which most of the time

00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:18,980
is sanitized so I went well can't you

00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:20,750
just copied that and use that and they

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,920
said yes if it's been done properly if

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,230
the users have followed the procedure

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,030
which anyone here that's programmed for

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:30,080
more than 10 minutes nose isn't the case

00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:33,560
then yes you can do that so I set myself

00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,360
this task and so far I've got a PDF

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,980
document with lots of fun information

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,020
that unfortunately I can't share hence

00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:44,510
my hoping my laptop up here I've used

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:47,380
PDF to HTML Exe because I'm running on

00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:49,340
windows for some strange reason and

00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,160
subprocess which may or may not be the

00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,130
best way to do it to convert it to a

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,740
complex xml file which gives me

00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,440
wonderful mark up with a whole bunch of

00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:03,350
location variables so I can do top a

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,900
range lookup for all of the text FG

00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:09,740
roots so all of the text items that have

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:12,380
an attribute of top being zero to one

00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,180
hundred and forty I decided which grabs

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,530
the header so I can then ignore that

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,380
when I'm searching because I know it's

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,980
going to be the same on every page where

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,880
I'm stuck at now is fudgy fudgy which is

00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,530
also kind of fuzzy fuzzy logic which is

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,420
something I've seen in other people that

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,850
do scraping so basically what i'm doing

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,470
the scraping and there's a lot of people

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,690
out there i know that work with scraping

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,220
stuff so if anyone has experience with

00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,910
scraping information from really

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,830
horrible sources I will hunt you down or

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,850
you can hunt me down please and I'll buy

00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:52,280
you a drink because you have a nice

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:54,290
beard no so I also have this really

00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,800
warped ambition of once I've got a pile

00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,020
of text stored somewhere in memory to

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,060
manipulate I would like to use and this

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,950
is how you know I've got haven't had my

00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,830
soul crushed yet I want to use the

00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:09,110
natural languaging natural language

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:13,360
processing toolkit to summarize the

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:17,240
information and actually then generate a

00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,100
document shooting for the stars fall

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,970
somewhere hopefully not in a pile of poo

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:25,460
that's this is how I do projects so

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,340
yes very ended ambitious young Python

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,920
programmer that has been a far more than

00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,500
he can chew and is interested in other

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,750
stuff as well looking possibly for

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,450
programming job but that's this is what

00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:46,730
I do i find horrible things and i try

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:48,500
and automate it so yes thank you ok now

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,850
we fund come to an interesting time

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,320
that's that's all the Lightning talks

00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,430
but don't run away just yet we've got

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,430
