Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	This talk will explore the use of python's meta-programming facilities to create a simple declarative API so that you can *say what you mean* - write code that focuses on the what and the why without being cluttered by the how.  If you've ever wondered how the Django ORM or SQLObject work their magic, this is the talk for you.
