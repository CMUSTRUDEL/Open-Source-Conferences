Title: Infinite 8-bit Platformer - Mr. Chris McCormick
Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	Infinite 8-bit Platformer is a Free Software multiplayer user-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit like a cross between a wiki and a game, because the players can also create and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development of the game over the last three years, including what has changed since PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound, graphics, and networking architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet).

Rick this is chris he describes himself

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,400
as a free software hacker musician game

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,010
developer and reasonably bearded it

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,120
should be is accurate to me so he's

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,400
going to talk about infinite 8-bit

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,680
platformer take it away I had a bit of a

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,910
shave before I came so not as beard as

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,039
normal but someone bearded last year I

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,920
spoke a bit about infinite a bit

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,470
platformer my game project and I'm now

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,820
into the nearing the end of the footwell

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,750
about the middle of the third year of

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,149
developing it so it's been a bit of a

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:42,809
labor of love to take me awhile to get

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:44,730
here these are my details so here the

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,680
most salient things about infinite a bit

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,329
platformer well I haven't written up

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,100
there that it's written in Python but

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,800
that's kind of obvious otherwise I

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,719
wouldn't be here it's free software so

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,219
we all know what the advantages and

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,879
disadvantages of going through software

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,590
are basically means that if anyone wants

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,199
to hack on it they have to give the

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,909
contributions back and they're free to

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,159
distribute it copy the binaries for

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:14,070
other people etc it's GPL version 3 it's

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,500
multiplayer that's new since last time I

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,720
spoke about it I had just got the

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,090
multiplayer code working but it wasn't

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,110
yet at the point it is now where you can

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,939
actually have multiple people playing

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,210
the game at the same time and doing all

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,360
the stuff you can do in the game it's

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,340
actually more of a virtual world than a

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,250
video game so I've said here cross

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,869
between a wiki in a world hopefully that

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,270
creates the right image in your mind of

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,680
a wiki is you know a text document that

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,060
multiple people can work on at the same

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,299
time and edit and this game is a virtual

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,920
world or a series of levels that people

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,200
collaborate on and work on at the same

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,240
time of course it uses Python and the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,390
library underlying library i'm using to

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:06,710
do that is pi game how many people here

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:09,209
have used by game okay cool great stuff

00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,679
especially the last version of pi game

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,190
it doesn't you know they don't have

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,660
releases that often i don't think

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,890
the last version put in a whole bunch of

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,590
stuff that's been very useful just

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,480
something like philosophical things here

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,940
there are no baddies in this game and no

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,580
killing it's basically an exploration

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,140
game so the idea is it's this big

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,200
virtual world that multiple people can

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,510
log into and collaborate on and there's

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,550
it's it's not it's not a competitive

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,700
game it's more of a social game it's

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,920
more of an exploitative creative game

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,230
and i purposely did that I think I think

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,970
there's there's not you know there's a

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,770
big emphasis when you're writing a game

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,040
the first thing that jumps to your mind

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,750
is make a competitive make it it's very

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,790
easy to create a shooter for example I

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,460
mean I mean easy as in coming up with

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,530
the ideas because there's so much to

00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,720
borrow from as well out there in the

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,720
world that already are based around this

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,600
idea of killing bad guys but I think

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,600
it's a maybe not such a good thing

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,630
culturally all right I'll show you a

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,459
demo so I've got it running here locally

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:21,850
on my laptop this is the server response

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,190
probably too small isn't it well

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,020
whatever i'm just running a local

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:31,450
version because i don't want the network

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:33,580
to go down or anything like that so the

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,420
server started and i'll connect to the

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,420
local host server

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,540
and here it is so basically the way you

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,390
play this is to run around collect items

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,770
and explore levels so you can do all the

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,270
normal type platform where things

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,530
jumping up and down you can collect this

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,239
little sheep here and then you have

00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,920
these things which are portals if you

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:06,130
can run into a portal and there's a new

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:08,530
level there now these levels work these

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,519
two were created by me actually I think

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,950
this one might have been something else

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
but you can click on this button here

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,890
and you get small buttons so you've got

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,650
a back button over here on the left that

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,600
just takes you back to the last teleport

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,729
portal you put it through so this is

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
when we came into the level and if you

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,450
run off it then you can go back again

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,060
and then that's taken me back to the

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,040
previous level whoops yeah this is

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,250
there's this is the whole no killing

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,810
thing it just jumps you back so you get

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,970
like a little bit of a feeling of who I

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,229
just stepped off the platform but it's

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,050
not the end of the world you can just

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,520
continue so it's very much

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:47,350
non-competitive but so what you do is

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,229
walk around exploring collecting items

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:54,100
now you also have these other icons up

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:56,080
here which are edit lock and new so this

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,490
level here is locked it's one of the

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,890
built-in levels when you first log into

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,510
the game so I locked those ones but if

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,910
you want to you can press this button

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,820
here which is new and created a

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,950
completely blank new level now it starts

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,960
you in you are in edit mode to in order

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,300
to get to that new button you had yet to

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,560
click the edit mode icon now once you're

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,110
in once you've created your own level

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,169
you can edit it as you please so that

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,120
includes things like here we've got the

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:25,690
regular type of drawing tool so you can

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,720
airbrush fill draw like a pen style draw

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:32,320
and draw line so let's just get a feel

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,729
thing here and we'll fill in let's get a

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,600
better color this one here let's make

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,560
the portal pink too we'll make this one

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,950
grey

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,310
and we'll put some of these lines around

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,310
the edges

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,879
so you can see that basically you can

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:03,449
just edit whatever graphics you like on

00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:07,169
there now once I've created this level

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:10,740
oh and one great thing to do once you've

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,990
created a block is use the clone tool

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,719
which is here so you've got clone move

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,860
and delete so move obviously you can

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,539
grab things and move them around clone

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,919
you can clone something you've

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,479
previously made now that one's really

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,509
useful for making larger levels because

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,889
you make three or four things maybe a

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,150
draw a tree or something like that and

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,219
then you can clone them and make lots of

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,639
copies of them so here I can make a more

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:40,979
complicated level by cloning things

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,939
whoops the collision detection there's

00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,279
done on a rectangle so I have to give

00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,930
them enough room to move around so but

00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,270
once you've designed your level you can

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,259
go up here to the level naming so here's

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,849
your level name at the moments just

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,919
called for ten which means it's like the

00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:58,169
four hundred and tenth level on the

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,509
server that's been created so we'll call

00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:06,210
it hello land now someone else can log

00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:07,889
in i could tell someone else go check

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,129
out my level it's called hello land and

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,810
to do that you can teleport so i'll

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:19,099
teleport to a level someone else has

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:19,099
made crystal and it crashes

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,280
let's try it out again maybe i'll

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,240
teleport to a different level I probably

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,030
left crystal unlocked and some editing

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,659
command bugger haven't fixed yet but so

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:42,389
anyway we can go down here and go

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:45,930
teleport to hello hello land and you can

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,569
see it receiving the 1004 1142 updates

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,639
and drawing the level there and so now

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:54,270
if someone else logged into this same

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
level we could see them as well running

00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,650
around and you can use the chat down

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,509
here so you can do if you use the chat

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,449
box without a ford / so the food /

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,710
commands are like forward slash teleport

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,469
food / help is another one that shows

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,289
you the website help and you can say

00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:15,900
hello and your little person there says

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:17,310
hello and anyone else who's logged in

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,120
you can see that so the standard kind of

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,529
multiplayer thing and so I'm the other

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,810
things you can do up here I create a

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:30,240
ladder you can create a ladder like this

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,690
run up it and you'd obviously use this

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,870
one here to draw in some bars so you're

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,519
actually running on something and then

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:44,399
clone this guy put it up here so then

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
you can run on okay so that's that's

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,699
basically how it works you can create

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,350
items as well fill them in you can

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:54,480
collect them yep so that's the game in

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,240
essence and the idea is that people can

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
share these levels with each other and

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,230
actually they can collaborate and create

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,760
a portal and link their portal to

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,800
someone else's portal so you'd link this

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,570
one you see the little portal icon here

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,199
you click on that and then you go to the

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,440
level that you want it to teleport to

00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:15,149
and it and then link it and then

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,410
whenever anyone's on this level they can

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,699
go through that portal to join the other

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,070
level so it's kind of like a hyperlink

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:25,339
on the web the hyperlink points at some

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,339
of the level and directly to a portal

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah so that's the that's the editing of

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,440
the game in a nutshell and when other

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,090
people come here

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,070
lock it you can lock your own level so

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,380
no one else can edit it now when they'll

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,710
just see this you know like how it looks

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,670
without any n is going to invisible

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,340
ladder there but that's what they'll see

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,530
and you can make these levels there 1024

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,940
x 1024 pixels so you can make quite a

00:09:49,530 --> 00:10:01,170
large complicated level and that's

00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:01,920
that's the game in a nutshell so I'm

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,790
just going to go through a quick

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,820
timeline of the life of this game 2010

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:13,020
it's started into early 2009 2010 2011

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,150
still going so it started life as a

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,710
little experiment called minimalist

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,050
platformer and what that basically was

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:22,140
was I just made a platform and it was

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,700
just blocks so I kind of abstracted away

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,050
that what the core concept of the game

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,270
wasn't just wrote that as a library

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,830
first so you know as a programmer you

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm always doing this too much like

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,220
abstracting everything too much but I

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,930
also wanted to get something releasable

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,240
and I wanted to make sure the build

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,650
system was able to build for all the

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,780
platforms I wanted to target in the end

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,970
so and that's what mentalist platform

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,630
did I had executables for Windows Mac

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:49,860
and Linux I just left the source code as

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:52,820
as I usually do so minimums platformer

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,710
then the first cross-platform build of

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,550
insulin platformer itself was in june

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,260
2009 just a bit of geography i was

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,510
living in london with my wife for the

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,050
first bit of the game and perth for the

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,840
second bit of the game so spread across

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,790
two locations the first contribution

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,430
from someone was in november two

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,770
thousand nine that was just as we left

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,810
London a guy from Perth actually sent me

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:22,350
a patch to fix the windows think so that

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:26,550
was really nice pre alpha testing

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,930
happened in March the first levels and

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,310
tools that someone contributor were here

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,890
my friend Crispin sent through the air

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,010
brush tool a patch for that and some

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,990
great levels as well multiplayer I first

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,880
started here and then pike on a you

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,650
happened just after that so I didn't

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,120
really have working multiplayer yet but

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,410
you can now if you download the game off

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,460
the website and you play with other

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,620
people you'll all be in

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,690
level and the editing commands all work

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,870
there as well this big gap here is where

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:56,760
my daughter was born just show a couple

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,930
of pictures of course you know I'm not

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,480
biased or anything but I think she's

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,460
giving pretty smile that I love this

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,750
photo because it basically sums up how i

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,250
want people to feel when they play in

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,930
front of platform alike just that sense

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:13,890
of joy and you know new things free

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,360
after she was born I've managed to get a

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,230
whole bunch of hacking in there in

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,200
February March and then did the release

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,680
in May 2011 so it's actually available

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:29,040
now on the website for windows linux and

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,560
mac linux users still have to download

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,910
the source but i don't really know a

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,580
good way to package up for linux i'm

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,080
sure there is one but linux users seem

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,410
to be okay generally with downloading

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,850
the source so what's next better help

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,940
and instructions lots of users have

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,370
requested that there's a guy called John

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,990
radke I think his name is pronounced who

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,400
did this message sign patch so when you

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,200
go into a level there'll be a sign there

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,470
and you can read what someone's left a

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,090
little message there avatar

00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,550
customization is a big one lots of

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,260
people have asked for so making you out

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,260
and making a little matter little dude

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,490
look what have you like and chat

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,260
improvements because at the moment the

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,550
chats kind of awkward it's on the player

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,560
there needs to be a bit of a history

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,210
happening there and an ability to tell

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,970
who's saying what gets very confusing

00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:17,280
when we were doing multiply and testing

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,020
and I'd like to set up registration in a

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,850
form on the website so when you read

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,930
when you click through on in the game

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,890
you'll be able to register your

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,330
particular copy and that means it'll

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,140
you'll take all your levels with you so

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,740
you'll always be able to authenticate

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,510
against the server so how do you

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,580
contribute if you would like to hack on

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,930
this a bit these instructions are just

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,910
directly off the website so if you go to

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,740
infinite platformer calm you can check

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,440
out these instructions but it's quite

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,570
simple i'm using bizarre to version you

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,890
check out the source code check out the

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,480
library pod 6 net and check out the pod

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,910
6 library those are libraries i

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,000
developed for building other games but i

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,550
also use them in this one here's the

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,840
dependencies pretty much pretty

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,700
straightforward and these are different

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,160
commands so you can do you can run it

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,590
normally the client normally you can run

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,220
the server here this fourth line down

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,050
here and there's this great new thing I

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,910
added recently which is the server

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,980
console which lets you actually it gives

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,810
you a live Python prompt inside the

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,340
server so you can you can do stuff like

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,700
inspect how many clients there are and

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,380
all that so I'm just going to quickly go

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,300
through the public library it's graphics

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,800
abstraction input abstraction and entity

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,210
management is basically does so it's

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,910
makes of writing games with pie game

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:36,930
easier it looks like this so you've got

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,780
an entity class and there's this thing

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,060
called concurrent which is a mix in that

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,710
allows you to it basically gives your

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,990
entities these update and draw things

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,420
that happen automatically so it's doing

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,850
a basic concurrency without having to

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,890
use threading or something like that and

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,200
it captured it catches events using this

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,150
event monitor mix in as well those

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,770
events are standard play game kind of

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,900
events like key down space so you just

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,640
create a method called key down space

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,950
and when you hit when the player hits

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,660
space it calls this function so it saves

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,600
a bit of the messing around that you

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,520
normally have to do and here's how you

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,800
manage your entities add a new entity

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,450
get rid of them on the anti's oral

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,310
hierarchical so you have these

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,470
hierarchies of entities and it draws

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,630
them so draw the parent entity first and

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,790
all their children so you can build you

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,330
know complex interfaces and stuff like

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,070
that quite easily so this is the pod

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,870
signet library which is the network

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,500
library I wrote on top of a sink or an

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,900
async chat in the in the Python standard

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,700
library and they once again are just

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,830
there to make life easier for someone

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,250
trying to write a game a Python game

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,740
network based game quite a few people

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,730
that have used this already for their

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,710
own projects there's a thing called

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:54,290
construct for windows which is like a

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:56,550
Windows game development library and

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,860
yeah some people have used this inside

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,420
construct apparently with great success

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,130
but it lets you so in your client you

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,140
you just have to do this once every

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,080
frame is

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,680
pumping and it'll automatically call

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:16,550
your methods that are named network

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,970
underscore whatever if the sender has a

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,920
key in the data it sends called action

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,560
I've actually written that wrong that

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,140
should say action hello so if someone

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,320
sends a packet of data with action hello

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:35,570
it'll call this network hello so quite

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,330
simple and this is the on the server

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,860
side you have a representation of the

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,470
client so you could this client channel

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,030
which is a representation of your client

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,710
and once again you put these named

00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,900
methods which when data comes from the

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,420
client with action hello the server will

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,580
see network hello and it's got this

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,330
basic send which you just send Python

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,940
structures so you know dictionaries or

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,010
lists or whatever this is the actual

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,810
server itself when someone connects you

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,790
get is connected and you tell it you

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,690
want to use the chat the channel class

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:10,990
you just we just saw so here you can

00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,070
throw that all together quite easily and

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,459
this is an example of running the server

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:20,750
just once per frame running this method

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,010
here so that's that's my talk and I just

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,380
want to say thanks to these people

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,600
Crispin Wellington Patrick Mullen Julian

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,740
huh Brock John rocky and Brad power and

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,660
Shannon loss and these are all people

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:34,430
with contributed code hope I didn't

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:37,840
