Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	Infinite 8-bit Platformer is a Free Software multiplayer user-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit like a cross between a wiki and a game, because the players can also create and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development of the game over the last three years, including what has changed since PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound, graphics, and networking architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet).
