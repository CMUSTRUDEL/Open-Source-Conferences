Title: Zookeepr: Home-grown conference management software - Ms. Brianna Laugher
Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	Zookeepr [http://zookeepr.org/] is a comprehensive web-based conference management system, written in Python and built on Pylons. It has an unusual development history: custom created for the annual Linux.conf.au conference, there are yearly spikes in event-focused feature development, but relatively little of the ongoing development typically seen in open source projects.

hi everyone thank you for coming this

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:10,440
morning my name is Brianna just out of

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:15,059
curiosity who here has attended an LCA

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,740
Linux conference probably about half of

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:23,640
the people and who has poked around or

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,890
contributed to the zookeeper code okay

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,779
so this is pretty much the zookeeper

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,450
road just here and one over there and I

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,079
know everyone here has gone through

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,190
using web-based conference management

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:46,110
system and basically what this talk is

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,940
is a an invitation to people to consider

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,480
contributing to this as an open source

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,899
project so it's not a technical deep

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,090
dive into this project and this might be

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,920
best suited if you had just meant the

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,710
two sessions this morning at the Python

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,250
101 plus so if you're the type of person

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,700
who has founded your own project or

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,390
projects this is probably not for you

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:17,640
that you might learn something new while

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:21,150
you're here so zookeeper is the name of

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,390
the system which is used by Linux

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,580
Australia for their annual conference

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,000
which is called winning scoffs today you

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:35,790
or LCA and Linux Australia is also

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,110
sponsoring this conference or supporting

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,140
this conference although it's not with

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,150
software and so it's really been

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,070
developed over the past four or five

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,290
years as a very LCA specific thing so

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,720
it's the classic open-source scratch

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,610
your own itch and itch is we want to run

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,290
a conference and we need some software

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,509
to get everyone registered and organize

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,850
all the papers and so we're going to add

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,390
it ourselves and it actually has a

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,390
history of um I think initially there

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,550
was some PHP scripts and then the next

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,229
year there was some pearl and then the

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,450
next year there was some Python and the

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,540
python has actually managed to stick for

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,780
a few years now which is definitely good

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,730
for stability and we've managed to

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,660
collectively resist the urge to rewrite

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,390
everything every single year so it

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,069
handles all the basic stuff that you

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,760
would expect call for papers or

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,640
presentations proposals attendee

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,160
registration invoicing people so that

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:44,849
they actually pay you and scheduling the

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:48,410
talks and it's licensed under the GPL so

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:51,840
from a Python perspective it's using the

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:55,019
pylons model-view-controller framework

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,550
which I believe is now a little bit

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,909
behind and at some point we'll have to

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,860
look at moving to pyramid so it's very

00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,480
good that later today there's a talk

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,300
about pyramid maybe there'll be some

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,650
zookeeper people zookeeper people paying

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,500
attention there you know blah blah blah

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:19,440
normal stuff this is all pretty average

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:23,330
for a web based project so the first

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,560
year it was used was in Sydney in 2007

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:30,569
and since then it's stuck in people have

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,480
just applied a different theme each year

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:37,709
but a bit each year has had a little bit

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,450
extra development added to it but you

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:44,940
can see the basic look is quite similar

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:50,849
and next next year in January it will be

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:55,049
held in Ballarat that's coming up so it

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:56,700
initially started out just with you know

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,670
the very basic stuff the stuff that you

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,680
need to get done and since then each

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,659
year a little bit more has been added to

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,060
expand it and to meet more of the needs

00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,110
and there are still I think plenty of

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,970
functionality which is missing because

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,870
LCA is a very technical conference and

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,370
is run by people who are very technical

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,229
usually they don't tend to have that

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,770
much of a problem with being told that

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,220
they should

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,840
right an SQL query to achieve something

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,789
whereas generally as a user of web-based

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,479
software I wouldn't expect that that's a

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:35,819
reasonable way to get something done and

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,830
so more and more of these things

00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:46,409
actually having a nice front end put on

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:48,560
them bigotry UML diagram I don't know I

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,720
think all this really tells you is that

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,659
it does a bit going on it i don't think

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,400
it's horrendously like there's not too

00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,949
many crossing lines that i'm too worried

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,599
about there it's kind of complicated

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,770
enough to be interesting but not so

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:06,150
complicated that you couldn't get your

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,669
head around it and so the user roles for

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,720
people who sign up to it as an

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:14,190
application look a bit like that so you

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,560
can see that some of the functionality

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,190
is quite lco specific and is not

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,469
necessarily that useful at this point to

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,360
all conferences so one of the features

00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:28,169
about LCA is that they tend to get a lot

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,479
more applications or proposals than they

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,389
actually accept and so they need to have

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,130
a quite detailed review process where

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,990
they have multiple people who are on the

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,550
paper reviewer committee putting

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,620
comments and ratings on each of the

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,289
proposals because they need to whittle

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,479
it down quite seriously I think they get

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,759
an order of five times more papers than

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,380
they actually end up accepting whereas

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,759
if you have a small conference or if

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,219
you're a small event you're just

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,000
starting out chances are you're not

00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,979
going to need that kind of

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,039
infrastructure possibly you can get away

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,680
with you know a manually updated google

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,520
doc or maybe you don't need anything at

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,250
all and the many comps are also a

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,340
feature that not all conferences have so

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,310
LCA runs with two days generally two

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,870
days of men accounts plus three days of

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,779
the regular conference so if Pikkon had

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,319
many comps it might be like Django many

00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:31,349
conf pyramid mini conf scientific

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,750
programming mini conf so they're days

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,920
where the schedule is organized by a

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,120
separate person and

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,830
they just have a narrower focus and so

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,170
many conf organizers obviously need to

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,390
be able to contribute to the schedule

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,100
and arrange their stuff as well and

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:53,370
they're kind of separate to the core

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:57,480
team so I think one of the the big

00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:00,600
features or the the areas where Zoo

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,450
keeper really stands out is in the admin

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,630
functionality and as a person who had

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,580
used it as a conference attendee and as

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,730
someone you know attending park on this

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,250
year I don't think you necessarily

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:18,150
appreciate the complexity of running a

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,150
conference so when I started to look

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,430
into the the reports that zookeeper

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,970
provides you start to see what kind of

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,070
questions the conference organizers

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,100
would have and what kind of questions

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,370
they need answers to and you know this

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,270
is just some of them and you can see

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,730
there's going to be concerns about

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,600
funding there's concerns about have

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,380
people signed up for you know actually

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,170
completed the process all the way

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,960
through or did they get stuck have the

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,970
papers being sorted out have funding

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,610
arrangements been sorted out so if

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,130
you're a conference that offers some

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,500
funding support for your speakers so

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,180
they either don't pay for they generally

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,310
don't pay for the ticket and they might

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,350
need financial assistance to attend or

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,300
accommodation assistance then you need

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,180
to manage that budget and manage those

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,880
requests as well and then even you know

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,310
during the conference you want to be

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,780
able to set up your schedule and then if

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,660
anything has changed you know you need

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,010
to be able to update that quickly and

00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,040
even after the conference when you're

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:26,220
releasing your videos you you know

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,020
there's a thing in there to say or who

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,400
didn't agree to do the video release so

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,830
that you don't accidentally publish

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:36,320
their video and who we know we need a

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,970
little xml snippet to produce for the

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,979
start caption of their video that says

00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,320
what their talk is these are just kind

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,910
of like little niceties that you could

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,410
either you could do manually depending

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,270
on the size of your conference or you

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,460
could

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,090
of whipped something up to do it like

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,890
write your own query but because the

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,130
zookeeper has now been used for quite a

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,850
few years it's just starting to create

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:08,590
these features which is a good thing for

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:11,840
the ongoing conference organizers and so

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,640
this conference is not explicitly an

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,130
open source conference there's lots of

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,670
people here who would be using Python

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:23,200
not for open source or for closed source

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,760
for their work or whatever reason but

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,100
there's still you know close association

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,270
with the open source community and I

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,130
thought it might be worth spending a

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,780
little bit of time talking about you

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,680
know why that's a good thing why it's

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,330
worth contributing to it and why this

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,190
project in particular would be a good

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:46,600
starting place if you are not already in

00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:49,250
that space so if I was thinking about

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,400
what would i look for in a project that

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,860
I was contributing to for the first time

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,630
I would think okay I wanted to be in

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,090
Python because I love writing person I

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,980
want it to be established because for a

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,930
first time are coming to these kind of

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,450
things having a blank slate is actually

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,590
can be quite a scary thing and having to

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,770
come up with all the architecture

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,570
yourself is just kind of a case of I

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,160
don't know where to start so if you come

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,080
to something that has already got that

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,020
those kind of basic building blocks in

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,690
place it can be a lot easier to see how

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,100
to combine those to produce something

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,260
produce some new feature rather than

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,710
having to come up with them all by

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,680
yourself but at the same time you want

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:37,880
something that has a decent sized user

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,670
base because I think just there's so

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,210
much satisfaction to be had from writing

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:46,910
software which actually has users like

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,520
there's so much software written that

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,850
has no users or has a user base of one

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,430
and that's you and so that can be a

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,790
drawback from doing your own thing I

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,080
mean

00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,000
it depends what you care about that i

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,740
certainly get a lot of satisfaction out

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,930
of knowing that what I write is used and

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,090
you know in this case not just use but

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,730
it's going to be used by some of the

00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,620
biggest geeks in Australia so this is a

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:16,100
photo of one of the Linux conferences

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,460
they get up to I think 700 attendees now

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,750
so they're not you know when they're

00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,990
signing up to register they're not

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,730
exactly giving you a code review but if

00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,440
you do something really stupid you get

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:32,660
it you're going to know about it and one

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,070
of the things that I think about you

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,750
know the Linux conference in this

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:41,150
conference is that we're talking all the

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:43,430
time about best practices and what are

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,980
the best ways to achieve everything and

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,380
we have all these awesome ideas but in

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,180
this particular project you know we're

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,150
not necessarily putting them all in

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,740
place and I think that's a bit of a

00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:57,740
shame and it would be really nice if

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,860
this project was like a beacon like that

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,570
this is we're doing everything the way

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,230
that we tell people that it should be

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,690
done and you know this is how you do it

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,550
and the other thing I put up there was

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,220
you can meet other developers so it's

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,440
just kind of nice actually if your other

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,350
developers in Australia you can actually

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,440
meet them on IRC at a time that is not

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,940
like 3am is actually really nice and you

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,280
can come to a conference like this or a

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,410
conference like LCA or even just a range

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,930
and meet up in your capital city and

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,940
actually meet someone face-to-face I

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,710
just appreciate the opportunity to do

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,840
that not that may not be important to

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:41,420
everyone so as I said there is quite a

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,630
bit of functionality which is available

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,960
but at the same time there are large

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,630
areas where I think it's not so

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,190
established and mature that if you jump

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,550
in you're just going to be doing trivial

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:58,130
bug fixes or stepping on anyone else's

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,860
toes there's like large areas where I

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,720
think people could make a really you

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,540
know go for broke and really put their

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,579
stamp on something to add some great new

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:13,350
functionality to it so the first

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:16,230
being testing we have some nose tests

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,799
but is generally an under loved area

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,850
that could do with a lot of work up to

00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,920
date idiomatic Python I think one of the

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,309
reasons that I really wanted to talk to

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,629
this audience about zookeepers because a

00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,639
lot of the people who have worked on

00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:36,569
zookeeper and who work on zookeeper I

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,160
like awesome hardcore developers but not

00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:40,129
wouldn't necessarily call themselves

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,739
Python esters or they're not full-time

00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:45,299
you know python junkies and so they're

00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,519
not necessarily keeping up to date with

00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,709
what is the latest best practice in

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,589
Python and so for example we're using

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,299
pylons not even version one so we need

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:55,819
to get two pylons one and then we need

00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:59,040
to get to pyramid because like

00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:01,350
apparently pylons not even used anymore

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,579
or you know it's not the way future so

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:08,339
the way of the future and so and it's

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:10,319
the same with Python language features

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,839
you know I would doubt that we're using

00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:16,559
like all the latest nice stuff in 2.7 or

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,089
three so having people who would

00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,919
consider themselves Python junkies I

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,470
think will be a really great thing for

00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:26,040
the project and you don't get a chance

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:30,179
to insert lots of nice high 30 rooms i

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,249
think uh nel CA ification as i mentioned

00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:35,579
it's very much structured around the way

00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:37,679
LCA is run and so if pycon were to adopt

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,660
it there would be several things that

00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,660
you would need to either you know make

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,919
optional strip out and there may be

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,749
other things that you would want to add

00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:51,179
instead proposal selection so there's a

00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:56,419
lot of work done around reviewing

00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:58,259
proposals and viewing the overall set of

00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:00,389
reviews that have been done in which

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,189
have been the highest rated and then

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,899
they tend to have one day which is

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:06,600
called face-to-face where they decide

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:10,649
okay what is the final list that we're

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:15,629
going to have but then you know marking

00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:17,699
those in zookeeper is not the the UI for

00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:19,529
that is not necessarily there

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,429
even you know choosing your papers is

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:25,199
not the end of the story because you

00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:27,749
still need to confirm that your speakers

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,549
are actually going to attend so there's

00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,829
a lot of confirmation that has to happen

00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:33,209
with people all along the way I think

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:37,079
there's a little bit of work still to do

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,749
there and with the scheduling so the

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,829
schedule is now as the last couple of

00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:45,329
years can be constructed in zookeeper

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:48,119
but it would be really nice to add some

00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:49,769
kind of you know drag and drop things

00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:52,109
around to move talks to different rooms

00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,279
and make sure there's no clashes and

00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:56,819
that kind of thing that would be really

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,679
nice and I kind of there's a lot of

00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:01,559
reports but it would be great to have a

00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,449
kind of visual dashboard in the way that

00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,429
you might have with nagios or something

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:08,819
it's kind of like what's the health of

00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:11,639
your conference like so how your call

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:13,799
for papers going how your sign ups going

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,859
do you need to be recruiting more people

00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,970
to do certain tasks and you could even

00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:24,299
you know be checking the I don't know

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,980
semantic analysis of tweets about your

00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:29,369
conference to see if people laughing it

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:33,600
or hating it or something so that would

00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:35,489
be really nice an integrated mobile

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,959
interface is again something that would

00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:42,239
not be very hard last year someone did

00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:46,350
one but I think they did it in Django

00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,839
and so it was not exactly integrated so

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,769
that's yeah just something that would be

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,199
really nice to have and personalized

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:57,689
schedule for attendees / presentation

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,939
feedback I think odds Khan in the US

00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:02,549
have this kind of stuff where basically

00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:04,139
you as a atender you pick out which

00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:06,449
sessions you're planning to go to and

00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:08,819
then you can you know give feedback

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,240
ratings and that would actually be super

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,220
useful to next year's review next year's

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,500
team to know which talks were actually

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,949
popular which talks which speakers were

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,740
not as good as we had hoped because at

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,809
the moment all that is basically a word

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,789
of mouth and impressionistic so if that

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,190
was actually built in it would actually

00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:31,410
be a really concrete way for your

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,180
conference to you know learn

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:38,550
from itself and improved from year to

00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:44,310
year so if you think you might like to

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:45,870
join us and be a zookeeper then you

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,020
should grab the sauce which is off get

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,070
up we just moved to github this year

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:56,520
previously using bizarre in launchpad

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:59,040
and so I don't know even if you're not a

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,150
github experienced or get experienced

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
person I don't think we're doing

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,890
anything very radical it was heaps of

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,050
tutorials that you can follow about

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,970
contributing to github we have a mailing

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,420
list to keep a developer which you

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,160
should sign up for and IRC and there's

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,140
an issue tracker if you are interested

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,490
in having a look at some of the stuff

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,420
that has been reported that's kind of

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,190
separate to my wish list there so that

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,970
could be a place to grab something small

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:30,690
and I mean certainly installing it and

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,010
getting it running on your laptop yeah I

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,200
don't think it will be hard to find

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,990
stuff be like yeah I could tweak that a

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,190
little bit and be a little bit nicer

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,050
especially if you have a bit of

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:46,560
JavaScript food I think it could be very

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:48,000
nice so I'd like to thank James who gave

00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,930
as you keep a presentation and I have

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,580
fired a little bit of his material and

00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,180
thank you for listening and I guess

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,180
we'll take any questions

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:14,730
yep are you running a sprint this

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,460
weekend oh no we're running a sprint we

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,270
might sit around and other people might

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:26,610
sit around with us how about we do that

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:29,070
yeah maybe we might have to upgrade our

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,700
Sprint's to a bigger room that's not a

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:34,530
problem listen how do you approach this

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,750
really delicate line of making something

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,880
that's suitable for LCA and that sort of

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,830
conference and making it general for

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,870
more suitable for you know smaller or

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:46,020
larger or different topic type

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,450
conferences mmhmm yeah i don't know and

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,010
i don't think the zookeeper team has an

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:56,160
especially great idea about that because

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:59,190
it's still very much LCA focused so i

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,660
think initially there's stuff that

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,310
obviously we just need to decouple a

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,440
little bit and make it really easy to

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,980
plug in for LCA but then other

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,540
conferences you know on one hand you can

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,220
say well there's all those options you

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,900
can just ignore them but it's just quite

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,100
overwhelming especially if you were to

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,930
use this for a non technical conference

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,150
you might be quite overwhelmed and so

00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,190
you should just you know be starting

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,360
with the the bare minimum which might be

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,280
like the call for papers the

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,630
registration and the schedule i would

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:38,570
say so i think we don't know the answer

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,570
to that yet all right anyone else with

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,570
questions

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,309
I think it certainly got my vote for

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,920
migrating over to zoo keeper for pike on

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,380
next year I'm sure you have a lot of

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,940
votes from the audience as well if we

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,350
migrate maybe next year someone will

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,430
give a talk well why does it keep it

00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,840
stock so to move back I'm no I spoken

00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,220
something to the guys who are running

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,470
next year and they're pretty keen move

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,910
over so that's all great to to get your

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,520
perspective I have any Anna a delightful

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,080
why can't I you mum as a token of our

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,080
appreciation and yeah thank you once
