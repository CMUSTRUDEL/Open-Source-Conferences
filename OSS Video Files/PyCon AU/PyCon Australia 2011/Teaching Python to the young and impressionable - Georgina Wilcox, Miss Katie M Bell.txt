Title: Teaching Python to the young and impressionable - Georgina Wilcox, Miss Katie M Bell
Publication date: 2011-08-22
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2011
Description: 
	We present two outreach programmes run by Sydney University for high school students: the National Computer Science School (http://www.ncss.edu.au) and the Girls' Programming Network (http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn). For the past four years we have been teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based on this experience we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the parts of it which are still difficult for students to grasp.

welcome everyone to the second morning

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,260
session Georgina and Katie are past and

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,849
present students at the University of

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,590
Sydney by day they study and work at

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,170
Google by night and at weekends they

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,640
teach small people as i call them how to

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,109
program in python and they're going to

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
tell you all about it this morning okay

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:31,080
teen Georgina thank you yeah I'm

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,120
Georgina okay so today we're going to

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,309
talk about a couple of outreach programs

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,870
that we run for high school students so

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,370
just first I'll explain briefly why I

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,280
think that we need these kinds of

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,920
programs so basically computing

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,410
education in Australia isn't in a rather

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,539
dismal state in my opinion so the

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,579
average Australian teenager is an expert

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,969
user of technology they go on Facebook

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,859
and MySpace and msn they generally are a

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,079
lot more confident with computers than

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,120
their parents unless possibly that

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,590
parent is Peter love it or something

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,720
like that but and they also generally

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,030
almost always know a lot more than their

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,220
teacher about what they're about

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,689
programming about computers and they're

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,689
more comfortable with experimenting

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:24,479
future student okay so computing in high

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,619
school is boring it was enough to turn

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,180
me off computing I well I don't need to

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,710
talk about that but basically I was

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,110
never going to do any computer science

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,090
at uni partly because of my experience

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,549
in high school so there's there's one

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,310
compulsory subject that every student in

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,250
New South Wales does in years 9 and 10 a

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,259
10 year 7 and 8 and it's basically it's

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,000
word processing power point it's like

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,450
secretary skills they even teach you to

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,119
type which is crazy you know high school

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,549
students type all the time on msn or

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,530
whatever and most schools don't even

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,860
offer that so their computing electives

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,810
they're they're often not taken by many

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,549
students there might be a you know a

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,259
small student small number of students

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,840
doing it as a blood course because you

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,400
know if you get the computer to play the

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,510
special time then the teacher thinks

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,890
it's the end of the period and you can

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,690
go

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,370
anyway so we have this graph here this

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:24,700
is the percentage of students in in New

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,640
South Wales this year who are doing one

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,740
of the two computing related subjects I

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,900
cook I say them their computing related

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,130
because if you read the syllabus

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,530
documents on the board of studies

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,270
website you'll realize that so the thin

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,890
blue wedge is software design and

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,840
development about two percent of

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,290
students in the state taught what

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,260
pseudocode is and then the the larger

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,330
one ipt that's where you learn what a

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,670
database is so in neither of these

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,640
subjects well okay and unless you're

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,660
very lucky and your teacher goes beyond

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,430
the syllabus you're not really

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,940
challenged so here we have the national

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,880
computer science school referred to

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,380
after this as ncss so mtss is a tenday

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,489
residential camp for high school

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:14,370
students generally age 16 to 18 so

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,690
they're going into your 11 or year 12

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,110
it's held at the University of Sydney

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,910
it's run by faculty and student

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,340
volunteers and also X student volunteers

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,299
such as Katie and various other in fact

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,310
there are a lot of people in the

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,709
audience I realized who are somehow

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,799
involved in at CSS so there's there's

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,750
two streams there's a the Python

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,700
programming stream and there's also a

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,580
new stream introduced over the last few

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,980
years where students learn a bit of sea

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:47,080
and work with Arduino boards and the

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,640
irobot create so if you never attended a

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,890
nerd camp like this when you're in high

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,590
school it's really very hard to undo

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:59,950
it's very hard to overestimate how

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,980
rewarding and and beneficial it is to

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,950
students so I I didn't go to ncess i

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,880
went to a similar program formats nuts

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,190
and you know for the first time you you

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,329
go to this camp in your summer holidays

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,070
because that's what you want to do

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:17,040
because you love this kind of thing and

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,140
you meet other people who also liked it

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,330
and that's that's incredibly that's

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,490
incredibly exciting and also for you

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,639
know for a student who might be the only

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,349
programmer

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,960
high school or the only person who is

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,610
interested in programming it's it's

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,990
really great to meet other people that

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,759
you know can be friends for life okay so

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,229
here's a quote from one of our students

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,669
though sometimes the level of knowledge

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,069
from some of the students can be

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,509
intimidating and discouraging it's good

00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,879
for those who are stronger to lead those

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,770
who are weak but it can be difficult at

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,389
times and comparing yourself to others

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,180
can be discouraging so we have a very

00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:58,219
wide range of abilities at ncess the

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,569
program is academically selective but

00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:03,889
there's no prior programming experience

00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:05,870
required so so there are there are

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,460
complete beginners and there are

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,840
students who have been programming since

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,960
they were you know eight and and that

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,089
can be very intimidating it turns out

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,550
that girls are less likely to have prior

00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,710
experience with programming this graph

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,089
demonstrates visually I said the little

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,189
red thing down the bottom that's the

00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,439
number of the percentage of girls doing

00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:29,509
the computing related subjects for the

00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,240
HSE it's about eight percent which

00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,129
interestingly is less than what it is in

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,110
first year uni it's more like twenty

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,849
percent so there are more people coming

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,479
in in first year who haven't done

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,870
software I think anyway so this is why

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,399
we have the goals programming network

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:51,169
katie and i and some of the other some

00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,939
other women from in and around the

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,740
university of sydney run this

00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:57,860
after-school activity once a week during

00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,439
school term so we focus on building

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,529
confidence with Python and other things

00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:06,169
so here some of these some of our girls

00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,879
are taking apart and hopefully putting

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,460
back together some computers that we

00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:14,300
gave them they did all work afterwards

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,310
it was great ok so the third program to

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,589
talk about is the ncess challenge this

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,689
is by far the largest of the of the

00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,669
outreach programs it's an online

00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:25,939
programming competition that's designed

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:30,589
to teach our teach students to program

00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:32,060
while they compete there are it runs for

00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,849
five weeks in August so this is the

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,610
third week at the moment so you know

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,080
somewhere in the state they were all

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,180
it's open to students from all over us

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,120
so all over Australia at the moment

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,770
there are about 2,000 students who are

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,680
enrolled in this and some of them will

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,240
be I don't know it possibly sitting up

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,310
the back of their classrooms pretending

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,490
to I don't know do whatever but they're

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,069
working on this okay so they submit

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,419
their code to our system Tim we'll talk

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:03,289
about this later in the next talk

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,300
there's Tim and in addition to automatic

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,949
feedback so the system says right wrong

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,469
paths failed you passed some of the

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,539
tests or whatever students can also ask

00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:14,270
for help in forums or they can message

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:18,770
tutors through the site so the tutors

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:22,280
are generally volunteer uni students and

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,810
some of them are here now ok so Katie

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,050
will talk about why we want to use

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:33,560
Python I think as a as a teaching

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:36,080
language ok um yeah so I'm going to go

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,849
through why we chose Python to be the

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,069
primary teaching language of all three

00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,389
of these different initiatives what we

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,800
found to be really good about using

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,599
python is a teaching language what we

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,460
found that sucks about using Python as a

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,800
teaching language and some of the

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,849
challenges that are faced generally with

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,440
teaching programming to beginners um so

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,659
to start off with I'm going to talk

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,940
about hello world because you know how

00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:01,009
hard can it be this is a screenshot of

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,900
the ncess challenge website and the

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,430
first question of the beginner course

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,580
and I think of the intermediate course

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,800
as well is hello world so pretty much if

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,560
you can see the tiny text there I

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,210
consume in a bit more um you're expected

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,620
to write this line and of course I'm

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,479
going to show you a series of curd

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,900
samples and all of these samples are

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:29,560
things that students have submitted for

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,560
this question okay including this one

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:36,360
anyway I think okay it's Python it's not

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,400
like Java how hard can it be to write

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,860
hello world as a beginner programmer

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,169
right here in Java you've got like 101

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,140
different things you can screw up but in

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,180
Python you know maybe there's a limited

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,610
set of things that you can screw up so

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,890
maybe don't really get that you have to

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,450
type print you just want to type how the

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,550
world because in the interpreter you can

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,050
just say hello world and it will print

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,690
hello world sort of maybe if you put it

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,940
in quotes um they don't really get what

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,190
printers they use brackets that actually

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,730
works um but maybe they've got the wrong

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,400
idea a lot of students who have done

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,710
visual basic at school will try to put

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,780
first cap first letter capitalized on

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,450
everything and some students kind of

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:23,040
print out what the interpreter said

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,960
exactly um it's probably worth noting

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,730
that each question has a set of notes

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,560
associated with it for this particular

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,590
question the notes tell you pretty much

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,450
exactly how to do the question um but

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:38,370
even then some students really just

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:40,200
don't get it al in this case we've go I

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,820
don't know what's going on in the first

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,620
one and the second one that should have

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,040
probably typed it in in Microsoft Word

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,800
and it did smart quotes so that screws

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,460
that up um raw input does actually print

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,350
hello world but of course the it doesn't

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,320
it doesn't complete because it's still

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,880
waiting for input um then you know as

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,530
you can see the bottom some students get

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,600
really really frustrated they can see

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,670
that the question will be easy but

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,180
they're still not passing the tests

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,710
because programming is hard and then you

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,710
get other students who like to show off

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,510
this student I think comes from a Java

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,660
background based on the the new function

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,680
and the HelloWorld factory but again

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,960
this is not like a student submitted um

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,850
so on the whole we find that on average

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,350
the students really love Python

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,760
particularly the students have done a

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,089
little bit of programming somewhere else

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,950
before they really appreciate Python and

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,939
some of the things about it for example

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:44,909
multiplying strings we find that Python

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:46,799
is good because you can start small so

00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:49,799
for example hello world is actually

00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,899
really simple um and getting simple

00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:54,179
programs up and running requires very

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,339
little code which is great but it's also

00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:59,159
a language that can grow big so it can

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,019
grow with the students experience and

00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,329
knowledge so you can start off

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,309
programming in Python and know that you

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,409
can build really cool really big things

00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,839
and that it's a real language that

00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:11,549
people are using in the world so you

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,659
might find that in high school lots of

00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,239
students complain that they don't

00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,859
understand why they're doing maths so we

00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,509
wanted to avoid that by saying this is a

00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:20,970
real programming language and real

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:23,249
skills that you could use in a job that

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,949
you can use to build cool things and

00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,959
that people have done that um typing

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,179
speed was something that surprised me in

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,459
teaching lots of students some of the

00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,970
students really suck at typing they type

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,269
very slowly and it's distracting when

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,220
you're hafting when you have to type

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,809
when you focus like if you for someone

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,789
who can type really well typing doesn't

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,519
require any thought and the students

00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:48,689
that can type better learn programming

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,339
faster because they're thinking about

00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,470
the programming and not about the typing

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,359
having a language that's minimalist

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,939
which involves as little typing as

00:11:54,359 --> 00:12:00,059
possible is a real advantage to a

00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:02,909
teaching language also when you're doing

00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,079
beginner programs string manipulation is

00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,239
usually one of the things that you learn

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,769
be first because it's simple you know

00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:10,079
here is this ring that comes in i'll

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,459
create another string that goes out and

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,589
python has a really rich set of tools

00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:16,319
for string manipulations plus the

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,669
interpreter sometimes it takes a lot of

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,499
prodding to get the students to play

00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,759
around in the interpreter but once they

00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:24,659
do they can find they find that really

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:27,059
helpful but then again python also has

00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:30,329
some disadvantages which makes it

00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,220
difficult for students to learn um this

00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,409
is again a court from a student who

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:39,929
found ncess to be a little bit difficult

00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:41,249
um and there are Peter loved it did a

00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,799
great job of going through a lot of the

00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:46,079
pitfalls at beginning programmers find

00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,479
in Python invisible types i think is one

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,009
of the biggest um so it's really great

00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,659
when you already know about variables

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,729
and you already know about types do not

00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,260
have to you know worry about declaring

00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,640
all of your types but

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,290
when a student is really stuck because

00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,730
they can't add a string in an integer

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,070
and they don't know what a string in an

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,600
integer are um that can be really

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,620
difficult for them we find that

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,840
sometimes it's hard to get students

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,090
motivated about doing plain text things

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,480
particularly to start off with we have

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:18,720
done teaching our web development with

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,420
Python arm so that you get some you know

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,820
visual interfaces that you can do but

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,390
that requires extra knowledge about HTML

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,400
and CSS and possibly even JavaScript and

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,990
that's a much bigger learning curve in

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,530
the same way most of the graphics tools

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,210
that you can use with Python have an

00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,400
extra learning curve on top of basic

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,830
programming skills that we found we have

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:46,080
been experimenting with teaching newbie

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:48,600
students visual interactive programs

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,110
with PI game and stuff but again that

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,000
has a sharper learning curve we find

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,740
also that the students if they don't

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,330
know what function to use in a

00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,160
particular circumstance maybe they don't

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,290
know about the split function on strings

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,510
they just get stuck they don't know

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,330
where to find things and we point them

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:09,540
to the help in Python but again that

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,010
might require essentially knowledge of a

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,690
whole nother language to understand what

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,320
the help is trying to tell you um and

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,260
discovering things can be a bit tricky

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,480
so often you need to have tutors around

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,910
with the students in the same room so

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,770
that they can help them find things that

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,410
they need and eventually students get to

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,930
the point where they go hmm I want to do

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,150
X this seems like something that Python

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,740
should be able to do and then they know

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,630
to go look for things but that's a

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,120
that's a step that they have to reach

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,760
before they can start programming on

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,900
their own um and of course the last

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,670
thing is we generally use Idol um

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,900
because it comes as a default install

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,530
there's nothing extra that you need to

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:56,870
install um but idle socks in various

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:59,070
ways um so if anyone has really good

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,450
examples of IDEs that would be good for

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,530
newbie programmers I would love to hear

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,080
it so this section is more about the

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,590
challenges that face teaching

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,420
programming in general not necessary

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,730
specific to Python this is on the first

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,590
day of ncess where we had a surprisingly

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,570
successful tower building competition

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,210
where you have to have a stuffed toy at

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,720
the top of the tower you can see a 1-up

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,520
mushroom at the top there um so one of

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,960
the biggest challenges is students are

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,310
really busy these days they have school

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,180
they have all these extracurricular

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:33,220
activities getting to a class is a big

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,500
ask going to attend a summer camp is a

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,440
big ask so having the time of

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,530
reservation and to do that is one of the

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,670
challenges support and community is

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,370
something that we found to be really

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,070
important and really helpful as is it

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:53,440
again a quote from a student at ncss um

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:56,980
I he or she hadn't done any programming

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,980
before but decided that he or she liked

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,040
Python because of the support that

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:08,080
they'd gotten at ncss um not for any

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,970
other reason so that is something that's

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,420
really important for fostering new

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:16,660
programmers um and one issue that we've

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,380
struct is the hurdle of installing and

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,600
using Python on one's own computer which

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:27,400
is an important milestone to be coding

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,290
at home we've tried installing Python on

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,970
the government issued laptops to high

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,250
schoolers but they are extremely locked

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,920
down and you can break them but then

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,780
they might lose the but we can't ask

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,180
students to do that because then they

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,470
might lose access to their laptop

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,590
because if they get caught it would be

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:47,350
bad so we haven't been able to find any

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:50,080
way to following all of the rules and

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,840
guidelines install Python on any of the

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,870
laptops so we're looking at options for

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,230
running Python in the browser so we if

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,820
you check out either of these links um

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,470
if you have more questions you probably

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,430
want to ask Tim Dobbyn after the next

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:09,430
doc um so one of those is C Python

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:12,250
compiled into JavaScript which runs a

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,920
bit slowly but it works and try python

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,400
is built on ironpython and that seems to

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,570
be a better option at the moment one of

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,310
the other hurdles to get over is

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,529
confidence this is the same court that

00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,569
Georgina had up before

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,189
we find that because there is no

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,659
standardization of teaching of

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,840
programming there is vastly different

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:35,409
skill levels in the same age group so

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,789
you might have students who are already

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,900
when i started at university there are

00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:41,960
some students who are already working

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,789
part time 11 friend was working

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,510
part-time for portugal telecom on a

00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:49,100
Python App no less um and I had done a

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,330
little bit of programming at school and

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,620
I thought that I was pretty good when I

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,570
was a school but when I got to uni it

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,039
was very intimidating discovering that

00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:00,460
everyone else knew far more than I did

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:03,710
um and that can be really difficult so

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,799
we're aiming to try and level the

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,350
playing field a bit more by focusing on

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,570
newbies but generally speaking the

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:16,520
students you might have met Sasha

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:19,370
already the students are really sasha is

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,539
actually a previous ncss student and the

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,409
previous girls programming network

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:32,710
student um and is now a tutor and is now

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:35,090
PyCon generally the students really like

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,970
learning to program and they really have

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,950
a great time learning python and every

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,169
year there are some people who start out

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,809
with absolutely nothing and pick it up

00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,250
and learn to enjoy it and go on to study

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:50,360
at university and that's always really

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,419
exciting to see so this is sort of the

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,090
general impression that we get that our

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:57,559
students like python um and that it you

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:03,230
know helps teach good programming

00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:05,510
concepts and in conclusion um we teach

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,149
python at high school because generally

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:10,220
the level of teaching of Python in

00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:14,200
height of programming in general in high

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,250
school is pretty shocking to be honest

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,140
we think we're already doing a really

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,539
good job of supporting students by

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,799
providing a community and programming

00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,539
experience for the students who already

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,419
know a little bit about programming um

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:28,580
but we need to focus more and this not

00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,559
doesn't just go for Sydney Uni and ncess

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,899
but in general we need to focus more on

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,419
the students who start out with nothing

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:36,290
because that is a really difficult

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,140
barrier

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,030
of entry and we're not going to get more

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,190
computer scientists and programmers to

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,750
meet the future demand unless we focus

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,420
on the people who don't already know how

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:51,530
to program um when we're teaching and

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,320
providing communities so that is it if

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,530
you want to find out more there's mine

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,210
and Georgina's contacts and the ncess

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:08,360
site has a information about all three

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:15,560
of the different programs thank you we

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:18,070
do have time for questions not so much a

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,260
question but more just pointing out that

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,510
there are things like movable python and

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:31,730
portable python there python that is

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:36,470
designed to be in it oh okay sorry sorry

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:38,750
um so what they actually do the the dt

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,510
laptops won't run anything that isn't on

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,390
the C Drive you can't put anything there

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,070
you can't do you just can't they don't

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,820
even have it's not just Python they

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:52,430
don't have any other programming

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,560
languages installed either this is the

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,080
digital education revolution and it's

00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,300
just it's frustrating that it's so

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,430
ignorant and da sorry you mentioned

00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,720
Silverlight as you mentioned a try

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,690
Python so they can't even install

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,790
plug-ins is that correct I yeah so

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,940
Silverlight is already installed onto

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,440
the deity laptops yum I believe internet

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,520
explorer is the only browser that they

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,520
can use that's also true

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:27,710
no no no leave isn't really angry um

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,380
this really angry sticker on the back

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,490
over the hard disk Bay which is like you

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,299
do not do this or this laptop yeah yeah

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,890
and they all have GPS tracking as well

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:42,169
which I guess is a good thing this Thank

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,059
You Man stock union is magical Torx

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,510
screw because no one has a 12

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,510
screwdriver

00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,809
what are your favorite examples like

00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:55,149
small examples to motivate kids to

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:57,340
actually you know but the programming

00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:59,940
can be productive and exciting like that

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,960
you give them to to show them that um

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,690
generally i'd recommend actually

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,149
checking out the ncss challenge so a lot

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,769
of the questions there the we freeze the

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,019
questions in funny ways but there really

00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:12,580
isn't a lot that you can do when you're

00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,190
trying to write questions which only

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,679
have if statements and no loops and no

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,899
lists and neuro dictionaries and nothing

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,190
really um so that is a challenge to find

00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:24,850
interesting questions that are good for

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,169
beginners um but the internet the the

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,259
challenge questions get all the way up

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:31,330
to things like writing a small virtual

00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:34,440
machine and using regular expressions

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:38,980
and reverse polish notation pausing and

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,389
um when you there yeah there's not way

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,809
we try to make them as fun as possible

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:45,249
um but I can't think of like a

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:49,570
particularly good example of a NEC

00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:52,269
question so at ncss the in the Python

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:55,649
stream we get them to build a web app so

00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:59,529
for refuse they built a search engine um

00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:02,619
but yeah no no Google is so you know

00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:06,730
back then now now they build a social

00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,989
networking site running on tornado and I

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,249
think that's kind of cool because you

00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:10,480
can divide it up into a group of

00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:14,320
students and everyone can do something

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,450
so there's yeah different aspects it's

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,489
pretty interesting a pretty interesting

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,429
challenge as a group leader or as a

00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:23,320
tutor I'd ncss to get a group of about

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:24,549
twelve to thirteen high schools kids

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,989
some of whom have never programmed

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:30,549
before two together build one web app

00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:32,080
and I'm always really impressed with the

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,899
results at the end of and this is only

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,249
in five days um because we spend the

00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:38,529
first half of the camp teaching Python

00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:41,109
and then the second half building this

00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:43,090
social networking site um so I'm always

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:44,379
really impressed with the quality of the

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,980
work that's turned out I mean sure it's

00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:51,690
buggy but wow it's built by students in

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:54,539
five days yeah

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,210
yep when okay do you have any statistics

00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:01,379
on the outcomes or at the end of the

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,720
computer science degree of your national

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:04,919
design some school graduates compared to

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,830
people haven't gone through that program

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:11,039
are they more successful that's a good

00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:13,129
question um I I don't think those

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,350
statistics would be particularly helpful

00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:19,019
mostly because ncss has a massive

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,269
selection bias so we're already choosing

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,889
the students who are enthusiastic about

00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,230
programming most of them have programmed

00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,429
before when they're in high school so I

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,559
don't think it would be fair to compare

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:30,990
the success of those students to the

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,460
success of other students who weren't at

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,139
that state when they were in high school

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:39,870
um that being said i don't know i think

00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:43,259
well neither of us went to ncss and we

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,820
turned out pretty well I hope um but if

00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,009
you want to or dating in first year

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,200
where everyone else is wearing the ncss

00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,879
tit well not sorry not everyone else but

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,409
there's a select group of people that

00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:54,059
all hang out together they already know

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:57,059
each other when they get to uni they're

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,610
all wearing matching t-shirts and they

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,409
talk about Python in their spare time

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,299
but you know you can get over that after

00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:06,799
a few weeks and it turns out they're not

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:12,269
that weird or maybe I got weirder yeah

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:15,090
yeah I guess just a small thing you

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:17,429
could try maybe going in through the

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,950
smartphone because you can get Python on

00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:21,720
Android now and there's it's not

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,460
completely fair because not everyone's

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,470
going to have access but you don't

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,870
necessarily need their laptops to get

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,879
plaything in front of them I think even

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,220
when you're programming for a mobile

00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:34,379
device programming on a computer is a

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,500
lot easier mostly because typing on a

00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:38,879
mobile device usually sucks out or at

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,659
least sucks a lot more than a standard

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:44,250
QWERTY keyboard um sir I don't know how

00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:48,090
helpful that would be but we have done

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,149
in jeep in jpn a bit of Android

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,340
development but yes you're right it is

00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,779
then your barrier changes from having a

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,289
laptop which they can install things on

00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,119
to having an Android device and it is

00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:03,950
really exciting for the students to be

00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,639
you know programming little android apps

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,499
but I

00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:09,599
don't know if that would have much

00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:15,329
advantage over what we're currently

00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:18,539
doing hi I'm here from Los Angeles and I

00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:20,279
i was wondering so I I'm really excited

00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,549
about what you're doing both with girls

00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:26,429
programming network and ncss and I was

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:29,339
in particular I really like the the

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,200
online interface where you can where

00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,509
students can work on their own until

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,349
they get it right and I was wondering if

00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:40,109
you had any ideas about how to bring

00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:42,269
either these programs or similar ones to

00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:46,229
the US and like what someone like me

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:48,239
could could do um this is kind of a

00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:52,200
personal goal of mine is not really part

00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:54,269
of the initiatives but um to have a set

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,259
of pie thing teaching resources online

00:26:54,269 --> 00:27:00,659
and available for anyone to use um I

00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:03,539
don't know I can't comment on what

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:06,809
future plans of the NGSS challenger oh I

00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,519
don't know if you we're not exactly the

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,619
main organizers of that particular one

00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,599
so you can talk to us afterwards and we

00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:15,019
can we can get you in contact with other

00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,019
people

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,850
um you mentioned at the start of the

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,769
talk that one of the biggest problems in

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,990
computer science education is that none

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,669
of the teachers really have any computer

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,500
science background is there anything

00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:35,330
that the national computer science

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,940
school is looking at doing to educate

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,860
teachers on how to educate students um

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,080
so this is probably something we should

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,840
have mentioned every year at ncess we

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,899
have we invite teachers to come as well

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,000
so um unfortunately very few teachers

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,490
actually take us up on that usually

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,529
every year we have maybe two or three

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:57,679
maybe five teachers if we're lucky who

00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:00,860
come to ncess and learn alongside the

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,630
kids arm programming in Python arm and

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,789
the feedback we've got from those

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,019
teachers has been really good they feel

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:10,820
like they've learned a lot and they

00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:15,769
enjoy it as well a James Karen who's the

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:18,139
organizer of n CSS has run in the past

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:25,880
teacher training courses so teaching

00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:28,159
teachers to use Python um and um but

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,630
again things have gotten busy and that

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,419
hasn't thought of fallen off the radar

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:34,100
but that is definitely something that we

00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,620
want to do it is difficult to get

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,320
teachers to take X they're usually their

00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,289
own time out to go to extra training

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,080
courses for things there are also

00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:47,090
teaches sorry there are also teachers

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,380
registered for the ncess challenge and

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,809
some of them get really into it and

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,639
participate on the forums and and answer

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,590
other students questions and ask

00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:57,610
questions and do the problems themselves

00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:00,200
which is great but not all of them

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:06,019
sometimes the most amusing attempts at

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,389
answers come from the teachers yep any

00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:11,179
more questions look time for one more

00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:13,039
okay maybe with the teachers you can

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,429
maybe deploy it on the web or something

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,159
you know see I sorry I didn't catch that

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:20,929
well if the time poor I mean they worked

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,960
their butts off in general and it's hard

00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:25,159
to actually get to Sydney or time away

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,629
from work

00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:32,100
you know maybe you could like package

00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:34,440
certain sections of the NCS stuff so

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,659
that they can you know sit down for an

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,970
hour or two and actually gets killed up

00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,769
yep so that is part of what we're trying

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,080
to do with the challenge by encouraging

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:45,210
teachers to attempt the questions

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,679
themselves but the challenge you're

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,749
right the challenge only does run for

00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,340
five weeks in a year and while they can

00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:55,110
access the problems and keep attempting

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:56,489
them for the entire year after that it

00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,200
might be good a good idea to have

00:29:56,489 --> 00:30:01,499
something that's available all the time

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,239
yeah all right I'm with that one I'm

00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:06,200
afraid we're out of time but thank you

00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,200
