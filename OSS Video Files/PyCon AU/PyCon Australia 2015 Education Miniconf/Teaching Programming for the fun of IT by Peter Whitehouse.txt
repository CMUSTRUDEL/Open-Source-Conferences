Title: Teaching Programming for the fun of IT by Peter Whitehouse
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Education Miniconf
Description: 
	The teaching of programming concepts has come a long way in terms of tools and pedagogies but the underlying concepts appear timeless. In this session we will look at the place of programming in schools in the junior school through National Curriculum imperatives like Digital Technologies and the Information Processing and Technology perspectives and how Python can have a place here.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

	00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,029
so almost 25 years ago teacher

00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,400
introduced his high school computer club

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,849
to this newfangled computer technology

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,680
called the world wide web and today it's

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,630
my honor to introduce Peter White House

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,970
longtime board member of the Queensland

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,520
society of information technology

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,449
educators as he considers the topic of

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:41,719
teaching programming for the fun of IT

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:43,670
thanks Nick um I bear with me please

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,380
this is going to be a bit of a journey

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,190
story but there's going to be a whole

00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,809
lot of stuff that I do in class embedded

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,190
in it and I'm really really nervous and

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,579
I'm not really sure why so i'll give it

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,739
a give it my best shot i love a language

00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,899
that's named after monty python that's

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,180
my first thing we'll come back to python

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,119
because this isn't really about python

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,860
it's more about kids coming to terms

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,860
with computational thinking and

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,750
programming a little bit about me I'm a

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,420
teacher and quite proud of being a

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,369
teacher i'm also an out-and-proud geek

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,460
and we all have our own puddles of geek

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,840
geek is power geek is knowledge we know

00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,130
what to do with that knowledge and some

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,869
people are football geeks and some

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,460
people are rowing geeks and I'd not

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,369
quite sure what my puddle of geek is but

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,710
I'm I'm quite passionate about it I have

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:32,060
quite a breath I'm not sure that I have

00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,670
a lot of depth in some of the areas that

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,229
I'm broadly understanding and that's not

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,509
necessarily a problem I'm an enthusiast

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,570
not an expert I have been a member of

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,729
the Ku sideboard for a long time really

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,170
interested in sharing resources and have

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,600
been centrally involved in that for a

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,740
long time I'm also a bit of a paper

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,860
folder will possibly touch on that later

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,180
it wasn't always that way when I started

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,220
teaching I was a math science teacher

00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,610
actually by all trained I did

00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,710
mathematical ecology before uni I'd

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,119
never seen a computer at all we weren't

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,520
even allowed to use calculators we had

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,140
to use a slide rule in physics the math

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,040
department said calculators would rule

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,230
would ruin of the planet they were right

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,170
but I remember saving up for my very

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,500
first calculator and insanely battery

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,790
hungry monster that did nothing and my

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,140
watch does more than that

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,269
now at uni I learnt Fortran on mark

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,090
sends cards that was the first time I'd

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:34,340
ever seen computers and you scribble on

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,200
a deck of cards and hand it to a nerd in

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,980
a coat and a week later you'd get a

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,480
printout with an error on line four

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,220
you'd have to fix that kicks that

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,780
instruction and resubmit it to the same

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,450
nerd in a white coat in a week way to

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,769
get an error in line 24 it wasn't that

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,930
way of learning programming at all it

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,510
was quite brutal we also learnt a bit of

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,370
Pascal on a timeshare terminal on a

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,639
mainframe computer in a completely

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,919
different University via a network which

00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,189
would seem to become the internet but it

00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,989
was like magic to me I went into schools

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,049
I was teaching maths and science an

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:10,819
opportunity arose where I got interested

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,549
in social maths or as I prefer to call

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,049
it math in space these wonderful kids

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:19,400
who were really dislocated from maths

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:20,870
and one of the units was programming it

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,939
was the man and mathematics program

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,780
before they got all PC and realized that

00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,430
that was alienating half of the audience

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,269
they changed it to social maths and then

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,129
they realized there were social

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,909
connotations and changed it to Matt say

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,979
because eyes are better apparently but

00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,209
Matt's in space was my favourite subject

00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,400
and we actually had an opportunity to

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,040
teach apple basic we had a lab of for

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,650
apple tues while various bits of a Apple

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,150
Apple tues and Apple two euro pluses one

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,250
had an 80-column card we knew how to

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,620
live back then and we were learning

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,889
Apple basic which was really quite

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,699
interesting then an accident happened i

00:03:54,889 --> 00:04:00,500
called my happy accident because the

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,409
government dropped our container load of

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,329
computers at my state school with no

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,159
instructions just big boxes they fill

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,340
the classroom we lost the classroom to a

00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,019
box farm it was full of sperry computers

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,280
and they stayed there for about three

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,389
weeks no one was interested in opening

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,269
them because no one knew what they were

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,680
and I said Oliver go and got in there

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,449
cracked all the boxes put the machines

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,150
together set set up a little printing

00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,979
network and from then on I was hooked

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,870
they were pcs well sort of pcs they've

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,020
sperry computers if you have any memory

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,659
back that far they were a behemoth that

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,039
really does very little but back then

00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:41,300
that was the digital education version

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,499
eer version one and it got computers

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,080
into schools where a lot of schools

00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:46,639
didn't have them I say that's a happy

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,939
accident because of that fiddling around

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,469
i managed to fluke new job in a private

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,569
sector and private school actually got

00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:55,279
employed by Lord Hill as computer

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,430
coordinator based on my experience of

00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,639
putting together pcs so the quality

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,770
control and job job interview wasn't

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,009
obviously there what's interesting

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,469
though is that that put me into another

00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,509
set of computers I was managing micro

00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,939
bees and set up an apple lab and started

00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,039
getting into programming got into IT

00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:18,439
education and completely abandoned

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:23,349
science and maths and have never looked

00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:27,020
back that job got me my current job at

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:32,120
terrace teaching ipt now opt for me was

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:34,699
a an accident I was interviewed because

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,770
i had had no I PT experience I'd had

00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:39,800
computing computer teaching education

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,139
but no I PT education no formal training

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,430
in I PT but the person who interviewed

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,649
me said you reckon you could do and I

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,020
see I'll give it a go and I got the job

00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:49,189
which was quite interesting I realized

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,599
fairly early on that I didn't know

00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,879
enough so went to Union did another

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,469
degree to fill out the computer science

00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,479
knowledge that I didn't have because I

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,649
felt like I was one step ahead of the

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,860
kids and I really didn't like that

00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:03,229
feeling way back then I felt I needed to

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,120
know everything I felt I needed to have

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,610
the answers before the kids ask the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,159
questions are much less concerned about

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,749
that now I'm during that unique or side

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,800
did a little bit of assembler language I

00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:16,129
can still read it I can't write it

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,490
anymore quite a lot of see also had a

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:21,379
look at some run one rather wonderful

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,599
abstract data types really got involved

00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,300
in the whole notion of structure and

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:31,399
knowledge and it really fueled my

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,319
interest I weekend changed my life I

00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,569
went to a workshop with a friend from

00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,360
keysight Michelle Williams some of you

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,819
may know her she did a workshop weekend

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,259
workshop on how to weave web prior to

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:45,829
that I thought it was some magical

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,360
mystery that was way beyond me i thought

00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:48,230
it must be complicated because it's on

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,610
this new

00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,110
called internet thingamabob II and I

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,550
knew nothing about it except how to plug

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,590
into it and how to get kids looking at

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,200
it I thought it must be just way too

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,930
hard in about quarter for now I was

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,970
suddenly empowered and I've been we're

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,190
being ever since 1992 was when I put my

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,310
first version of my online resources out

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:09,350
and they are still live today no

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,000
publisher would touch me because I

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,380
wanted to go in and change it when I had

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,580
a new idea for a topic I'd want to

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,290
rewrite it there and then and they

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,330
publish it would be confident in saying

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,580
I sure will do another print run of your

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,400
book so that for me provided a mechanism

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,990
for getting resources out there I also

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,450
was empowered to play around with mud

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,460
sand moves and chat rooms and learning

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,410
management systems I put on a Moodle for

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,760
the first time played around with that

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,140
we've got a number of people interested

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,610
in that I've done coed I've done boys

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,290
education only girls education i'm

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,330
currently in boys school so much of what

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,750
i'll talk about is couched in that

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,430
experience although in my experience the

00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,080
concepts of the same the way approach

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,080
them are just a little bit different

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:58,250
open source a really important idea and

00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:02,780
it came became to us as very important

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:07,250
when systems that we had in place went

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:10,640
away our school went to a BYOD or a BYO

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,710
everything model when they realized they

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,380
had labs that they had to roll over in

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,480
lisa's and they had server farms which

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,700
needed constant maintenance and onboard

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,410
technicians and so our school in its

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,730
infinite wisdom and glory decided let's

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,040
get rid of all of that get the kids to

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:30,200
bring their own i don't know that we

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,510
would timber Tim sorry Tim as I learned

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,380
colleague I work with him he got me into

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,419
Python I think we would probably look at

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,220
the way we did it as a school and

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,440
probably suggest don't go down that path

00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,380
it's a perilous path that's both

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,950
exhilarating and terrifying

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,810
simultaneously that said what it has

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,480
forced us to do is think about services

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,740
and ways of delivering curriculum

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,260
services that we had relied on forever

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,150
went away we used to use Delphie and we

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,740
used to use a whole lot of network

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,770
resources and win those server farms and

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,270
and network resources disappeared we

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,220
were sitting there going like why do we

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,590
use now okay we want to teach gear dated

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:15,570
kids databases but my room now is full

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,370
of Max and they won't run access I want

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,110
to teach them programming and I'm used

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,690
to Delphie and that's a windows-only

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,690
development platform why do I use now

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:28,500
and that was exhilarating and terrifying

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,090
it was a threat but we took it on border

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,290
after the initial shock and said okay

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,400
well this is an opportunity let's

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:37,680
changeup changeup so in terms of

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,570
software that we're now using most of it

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,940
is open source platform independent

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,190
because we haven't got network services

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,530
we can now default on its got to be

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,230
downloadable configurable and runnable

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,420
by kids on their laptop regardless of

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,430
the flavor of the laptop so we've moved

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,450
to things like scratch and scratch based

00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:01,470
products mentioned before so incredibly

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:03,320
powerful the digitech syllabus mentions

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,660
a distinction between drag-and-drop

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,930
programming and text based programming

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,480
as if there's some form of inferior step

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,830
up from drag and drop to text based

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
program you know Doug you anyone is

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,310
seriously explored drag and drop

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,770
realizes there's an incredible richness

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,900
and drag-and-drop environment and it's

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,380
not a continuum so we use App Inventor

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,040
and enchanting which is a robot

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,810
replacement for NXT as well as I use an

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,990
open source program called Lazarus which

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,610
is a window windows like programming

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,580
environment which is open source visual

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,770
Pascal I do use that primarily because I

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,050
want kids to understand and worship

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,180
structure you can't write a Pascal

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,440
program unless they're structure whereas

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,320
other languages are really really

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,780
relaxed in that regard we use Arduino we

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,550
also use Python I'm going to talk about

00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,560
the abstraction barrier and I did some

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,180
research on the term abstraction barrier

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,330
and the people in the other rooms will

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,950
be talking about the notion of

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,050
abstraction barrier in terms of creating

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,790
abstract data types and layers of

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,320
application that's not what I mean at

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:14,760
all programming is an abstract concept

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,660
we as people who have had some success

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,060
in program

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,760
me understand instruction leads to

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,950
action when you're learning in learning

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,190
programming it really isn't that obvious

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:30,270
I take a case in point Niklaus worked

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,560
the guy who invented Pascal and modular

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,840
two and a bunch of other programming

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,360
languages said algorithms and data

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,160
equals programs and that doesn't really

00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,720
help you understand programming it's a

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,020
bit like somebody who wants to be a

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,250
paper folder and they see the dragon on

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,800
the end and say I want to learn how to

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,020
do that so they see the end point and

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,890
they maybe see the building blocks right

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,600
at the beginning but they have

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,160
absolutely no idea how to put it all

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
together in an order that makes sense

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,750
and that dragon is that piece of paper

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,220
on the right hand side the golden rule

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,410
here is just fold along the lines and a

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,390
dragon emerges yeah that's you got that

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,650
not maybe a test on that later that look

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,860
under your seat there's a piece of paper

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,980
start folding now well as it turns out

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,690
that sort of bewilderment the oh my god

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
what do i do first where does it go how

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,580
do I do that is what kids experience

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,710
when the coding and we as teachers don't

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,600
understand that necessarily we assume

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,250
look it just makes sense you do this you

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,050
put the variables first you put the

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,820
statements you build a function the

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,980
function has parameters we as

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,650
programmers or teachers of programming

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,350
understand that but kids there's a

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,240
barrier and it's the barrier between i

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,920
call it the abstraction barrier thee I

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,200
know what I want to do but I'm not sure

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,120
how to do it and then you say ok here's

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,130
a brand new language let's do the exact

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,530
same thing and kids will spontaneously

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,000
combust because the deer syntax that

00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,280
they've only just learned how to drive

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,450
he suddenly turned upside down they

00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,730
gotta learn a whole new command

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:58,260
structure surely programming is as easy

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,650
as the hatch because that's what the

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,270
textbooks say you got to learn sequence

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,130
you got to do it in the right order this

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,780
followed by this followed by this you

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,180
can't make the bed by putting the dinner

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,180
on first you've got to arrange the

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,470
sheets underneath selection you've got

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,820
to be able to ask questions and

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,130
depending on the answer to the question

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,600
it's one thing or another multiple

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,700
selections and so on iteration

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,670
modularization most kids go what the

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,980
flip is this about I know what I want to

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,740
do and what's getting in the way are the

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,100
commands I don't know what commands to

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,930
do

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,910
I sort of got an idea but it goes wrong

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:40,110
I'll write 50 lines of code get an error

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:42,270
on line four and say this is hard as a

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,950
teacher I think the greatest privilege

00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,740
is being present while a kid goes

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,740
through an hour moment and our moment is

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,900
the R and now I know how that works

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,610
that's the internalization the I yes

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,460
okay I see where that's going I see how

00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:00,510
to fit that in there are variants that

00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,890
are wildly different view all is a wow

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,450
that's interesting I don't know anything

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,210
about it but I would like to explore it

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,620
and often our kids don't get past that

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,930
you know you showed them a piece of code

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,160
and they go oh and then they blindly go

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,600
off and try and do something that goes

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,950
horribly wrong and then they say how do

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,480
i fix this soon so 0 and r are related

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,800
but they're not the same argh I think

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,850
you're familiar with yes the missing

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,800
semicolon on line 5 not knowing which

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,600
dot notation to use a which part or

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,100
property or method of an object to reach

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,560
into and getting the wrong thing and it

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,080
just going haywire in the air is just

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,900
anywhere to start but the our moment is

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,720
I think the most privileged moment a

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,280
teacher can be part of they are and you

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,950
see a kid you see the lights go on and

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,720
they've got it and that's an absolute

00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,090
joy to be part of and we see that

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,480
occasionally we often see the ER in the

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,800
argh but the our moment is often private

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,360
the thing they did at home and they

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,040
finally wrestled with it and finally

00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,480
understand how that's how an array works

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,390
so i can put something in a ray position

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,540
number 4 ah now i could use that for

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:11,610
this ah light goes on if we're really

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,790
lucky the bulb doesn't blow language

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,060
matters and not all languages are the

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,880
same languages have what i call a syntax

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,330
wait that's the amount of punctuation

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,370
and extra junk you've got to throw in

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,130
around the commands to get them to do

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:32,010
stuff all rights I call that a syntax

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,650
wait content obfuscation I love the word

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,290
obfuscation basically sorry convention

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:40,680
obfuscation oftentimes the surrounding

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,720
junk hides the functionality you can't

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,699
see the wood for the

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,949
the trees are in the way all of this

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,829
extra bracket e stuff and headers and

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,860
footers and comment structures and all

00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,600
other junk gets in the way and

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,000
vocabulary bizarre I think I invented

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,920
the term is a bizarre 80 I don't think

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,899
it's a real word but ye gods some of the

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,879
commands that we ask our kids to just

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,439
roll off get more and more bizarre so

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,790
the original command might be really

00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,709
weird and then there might be four

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,689
separate dot points that you've got to

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:15,060
dig down to get to a particular method

00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:16,800
or property of an object and we're

00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,680
expecting kids to immediately go are

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,089
yeah of course that makes sense to no

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,610
one ever python is a little bit

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:29,279
different now I'm not going to trot

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,290
python out here as the savior of modern

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,600
programming and societies we know it

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,689
today but it is a little different in

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,750
terms of syntax wait certainly simple

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:42,120
Python programming is very light it's

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,550
very little in terms of the weight in of

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:51,959
the syntax required the convention

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:54,000
indent makes sense this block of tech

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,860
block of stuff is indented from that

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,649
thing which means this block of stuff

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,110
gets controlled by that thing that

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:05,220
almost make sense certainly simple

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:09,929
programming in Python is fairly easy

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,959
entry level I like the fact that it has

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,610
a interface called Idol I think it's

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,339
named after Eric Idle another python

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,530
reference yay I like the fact that you

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:21,689
can run Python install it on pretty well

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,449
anything and start typing commands

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,669
directly at the command line that's

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,990
interesting so you don't have to set up

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,669
a program you don't have to do anything

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,280
you can get in there and try commands

00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:34,770
straight away from an immediacy

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,419
perspective that's brill how different

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,250
is it from the fill out a mark sense

00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,470
card give it to a geek and a coat and

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,440
wait a week to be told that you can't

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,740
program right those here now that's sort

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,130
of interesting can you do much there

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,630
well yeah kind of you can because

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,059
there's an immediacy that allows you to

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,389
start surfacing seriously interesting

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,309
structure

00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,989
so you can write a little program in

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,149
Python I'm hoping that you've got some

00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:02,979
experience with the notion of writing

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,779
programs on interacting with them via

00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:07,109
the command line because that's really

00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,999
interesting so you can build a little

00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:11,950
structure and then test to see if it's

00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:14,669
any good live before you go using it

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,349
anywhere else that's really interesting

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:23,589
variables are objects they do all sorts

00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:24,789
of fun junk we can go to an ancestor I'm

00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:27,849
not sure if many of you in the room have

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:29,889
ever heard of logo I remember teaching

00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:32,589
logo it's a fantastic structure

00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:34,389
immediate feedback Seymour Papert would

00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,700
be rejoicing at this stage that there

00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:38,649
are still implementations of logo or

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,409
something like that around the whole

00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:43,119
notion of getting a turtle and driving

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,429
the turtle around and making graphical

00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,320
little patterns that's a fairly entry

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,149
easy entry level and we're contemplating

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,320
using this to introduce this to our

00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:54,789
great upgrade aids the idea of using

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,289
turtle graphics seems like a primary

00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:58,719
school event until you say well okay

00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:02,499
well let's wrap up each letter in the

00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:04,509
word Peter as a function and then write

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:06,789
the whole word as a functions that is

00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:10,029
running the function P then D then you

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:12,070
then be naturally compartmentalizing

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,479
instructions sequence matters if you

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,869
don't get it right the letters miss form

00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:19,359
all that sort of junk um in terms of

00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:21,579
readability and accessibility for things

00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,349
like sequence function that sort of

00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:25,209
stuff I'm hoping that it's going to be

00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:26,769
successful where they know we have

00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,059
absolutely no idea if this is going to

00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,320
die a thousand deaths or not because

00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:30,579
we're going to try that next term with a

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,039
grade eights but we think we've got a

00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:34,599
fairly good chance of it working

00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,440
primarily because this is sort of

00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,329
assignment kids can't steal put in

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,009
context great tens we actually get them

00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:44,229
to build a game in Python a simple game

00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:45,639
in Python and some of the kids do really

00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:47,259
really well and keep us in the loop and

00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:49,269
get us developing and we can see their

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,950
plan and we can see the code gradually

00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,450
coming from this horrible mess to

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,079
something that works to something that's

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,519
elegant to something that's really good

00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,109
and other kids do absolutely nothing for

00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,739
the term and then hand in this fantastic

00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:04,389
finished product and then take two words

00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:06,369
out of that Pro code chuck it into a

00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:07,090
Google you find the program they stole

00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,490
it from

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,990
and so it's really easy to steal if you

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,570
haven't got structure and stuff in place

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:18,940
as well entry-level stuff is easy it's a

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,890
really rich language the more I play

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,200
with it and I've preface this by saying

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,300
I'm not an expert I'm an enthusiast and

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,870
the more I play with Python the more

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,130
enthusiastic I get about the language

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,260
there are things I really loathe about

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,090
it will come to that but there are other

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,460
parts that I think are real strengths

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,370
and richness I like the notion of a

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:44,260
language that cares so little about type

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:46,870
I that I mean data type I come from a

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,090
language experience base we're

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,190
absolutely every variable had to be tied

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,230
down as to what type of data it was how

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,510
much memory it would take up and you had

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,190
to pre-plan it before you used it and it

00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,900
was a revelation to write a program

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,300
where suddenly are allowed to introduce

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,910
a variable when you need it and you're

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:07,600
allowed to in the program change the

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,520
style of that variable completely while

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,280
it's being used suddenly it's an integer

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,530
now it's a list with 17 variations in

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,990
the list has four different types that's

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,090
cool it suddenly starts meaning that you

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,520
can think about programs and problems in

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,170
a very different way you build a general

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,820
structure and then start stuffing new

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,110
stuff into it so long as you know where

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,660
you put it and how you put it in there

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,170
and how you get at it that's that's the

00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,750
thing so we're doing functions and lists

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,970
and all sorts of stuff this is great 10

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,980
examples we were working with our great

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,930
tents we had some real success and some

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,460
real failure with our great ends we've

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,980
been doing it now for three years Tim I

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,050
think it's three years and it every year

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,620
we teach it we're doing it better this

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:54,250
to this year we did a to a term of just

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,080
plain python text-based Python and then

00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,180
the second term we did what we call

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,600
advanced Python which but it introduced

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:07,660
some higher order skills file i/o

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,290
interfacing with SQL so there's a really

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:15,700
interesting way of connecting it to SQL

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:19,390
Lite and that's really some syntax light

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,650
I teach PHP programming in the amount of

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,300
code you've got to wrap her

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,670
found all of that stuff to make it work

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,360
is really horrific but this seems to be

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,310
really direct and great tens understood

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,180
it which absolutely blew me away because

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,950
I would have thought they would have

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,420
spontaneously combusted on compact

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,310
contact with it but they didn't they

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:41,710
coped so SQL using files using classes

00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,840
my interest and Tim will attest to this

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,180
suddenly when we started playing around

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,730
with classes suddenly I had in our

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,640
moment because up until then I had

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,310
thought okay python has lists and static

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,410
variables but that's about it and then

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,990
when we look at the idea of a class and

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,180
how to do a constructor and methods and

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,640
properties and suddenly there's nothing

00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,020
you can't do and that's cool and then I

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,600
start thinking well okay maybe I could

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,210
use this in ipt as well because up until

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,280
then I thought I PT needs a rich data

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,770
collection the syllabus sort of suggests

00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,910
kids have to be as I abstract data types

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,040
and understand a whole lot of

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:21,520
higher-order programming concepts and

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:26,070
they could in this language they really

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,750
could the more you look the more you see

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,490
there are so many extensions to python

00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,670
and most of them for me at the moment

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,500
are completely baffling I have no doubt

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,480
that over the next two days I'm going to

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,120
be sitting there going what am I looking

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,680
at as I'm watching sessions because I

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,740
said I minith izia so I'm not an expert

00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,840
and I need sort of help getting in once

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,560
once i have my own our moment then I'm

00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,230
fine until then I'm flailing wildly

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:59,220
drowning certainly it's not all plain

00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:04,180
sailing graphical interface in Python is

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,550
in my experience horrible right

00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,410
seriously horrible I'm only speaking

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,930
from personal experience and the only

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,470
thing I have had any experience with is

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,140
TK inter there's built-in interface kit

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,890
thing where you have these really odd

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,300
calls to construct visual elements

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,100
absolute mystery meat in terms of

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,510
controlling where they are what they

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,680
look like what's on them and how they

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:31,690
work and we I have failed two years in a

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,100
row trying to help kids understand how

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,090
to do this sure they can follow the

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,460
bouncing mouse

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,409
sure we can reproduce exercises that the

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,360
teacher has prepared earlier at the

00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,059
moment the teeth the kid says now I want

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,419
to do this I'm going her hoo-ha I don't

00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:49,090
know we'll find out together and that is

00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,309
both an opportunity and a threat I'm

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,960
sure there's probably other kits out

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,460
there I haven't found them yet as i said

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,090
i'm really new in the potent in the

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,980
Python game but we do simple game type

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,799
things thinking that that will help them

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,270
more generally and realize that it

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,679
doesn't later when they say okay that

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,909
was cute but now I want to do this I

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,440
want to have this button that goes here

00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,610
and I want this drop layout down here

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,710
and I want this image to move across

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,470
here and I want it to dynamically change

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,909
where you click on here and I'm helping

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:21,250
them find their answers using google

00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:26,020
right because I don't know it's mystery

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:30,010
meat to me at the moment many kids just

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,390
assume that they should just get it that

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,120
programming should come naturally to

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,179
them and I've never met a naturally

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,210
gifted program I've met extraordinarily

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:42,850
talented people that have worked really

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,570
hard to understand so that there are

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:48,309
moments go up but I've never met our

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,159
naturally gifted programmer including

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:53,110
young Nikki when I taught him as a young

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,240
bright-eyed bushy-tailed little kid who

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:58,809
had no programming and I remember his

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,110
our moments when he suddenly saw wow we

00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:05,799
can do this he for example using access

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,169
basic wrote her multi multi-user

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,470
dungeons and dragons and I didn't think

00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,470
that was possible

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:19,620
students need to be fearless when the

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,529
going gets tough a lot of kids run away

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,179
from this they go into something else

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,529
rather than persist because sometimes it

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,120
can be punishing if you don't know how

00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:28,259
to solve a problem if you don't know

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,840
where to look for an answer if you're

00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:34,139
not confident in asking for help

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,909
programming is punishing in some aspects

00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:37,080
let's say with Python but I don't know

00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:39,509
that it's actually a panacea for

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,340
anything any language creates an

00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:42,960
abstraction barrier and if you're

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,580
required to write in that language then

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,299
you've gotta try and work out how the

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,179
language can be working for you I like

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,249
making mistakes and will often engineer

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:58,379
in instances where I do it in front of

00:26:53,249 --> 00:27:00,960
kids I as an early teacher would never

00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:02,220
even contemplate going into a lesson

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,720
without an understanding of what was

00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,210
going to happen and exactly how it

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,860
should be solved and weighed up balanced

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,220
solutions in terms of what's the best

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:15,779
what's the worst these days I am

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:19,049
relatively fearless we have to help kids

00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:20,700
understand that the path towards and

00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:23,249
elegant solution starts with a

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,730
functional one get something working

00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:28,769
first certainly we've seen students that

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,090
code hundreds of lines of code before

00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:33,720
they try and check to see if there are

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,129
any errors I try to solve the problems

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,960
of the world before they've even got

00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,190
tiny little bits of their system working

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,980
so we've got to help them realize that

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,749
getting functional bits first then leads

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,970
to efficient they can't write efficient

00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:47,369
code if they'd never seen it we can't

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,710
expect elegance in code unless we

00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:51,240
demonstrate it and I don't know at the

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,679
moment whether I'm able to do that in

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,639
Python yet I don't know that I've got

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,700
the skills yet I'm realized and revel in

00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:02,970
efficiency I like the notion of I've got

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,619
a solution is it any good can I make any

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,759
better how do I tell whether this is a

00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,749
better solution than that the last term

00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,749
there is going to take a little

00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:16,379
unpacking understand worship and abuse

00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:17,669
the abstraction now an abstraction for

00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:20,759
me is something along the lines of

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,500
something like say a list you understand

00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,029
how it works you understand how to get

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,619
stuff into a list you understand where

00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,299
you can use lists in a program and then

00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,419
you say well what else can I get it to

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:32,490
do what can I stuff into a list do I

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,600
have to put the same sorts of things in

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,580
a list well in Python know cool so from

00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,409
a database perspective you could create

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,500
a list that was like a row of a table

00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:45,869
with mixed data types and then you could

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,360
make a list of lists and you have a

00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:50,100
table and then you just use normal

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,269
indexing to get two parts of the table

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,049
and suddenly you've got a database

00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:56,610
without even using any SQL that's cool

00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,710
you can set up a list and repurpose it

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,940
you say okay now I want to store all of

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:04,320
this stuff in that list and the list

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,820
items sort of type juggle I don't know

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,590
if that's the right term so that just

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,379
basically said okay I was an integer

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,860
before and now I'm this weird wonderful

00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:17,690
complex object and everything is cool it

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,690
doesn't win church

00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:26,750
I'm not afraid of that question see how

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,480
do i do something oftentimes I'll say I

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,280
don't know but the most powerful answer

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,440
I have found is let's see if we can find

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,820
out together and certainly from a

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,060
programming perspective that's been my

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,530
philosophy I look back down at things I

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,570
don't understand and don't wrestle with

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,080
and I often do that in front of kids now

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,490
I'll often wrestle with a problem live

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,680
seeing an adult wrestle with a problem

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,420
helps the kids understand this is a

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,700
problem solving strategy how did he go

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,710
about that he had no idea how it worked

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,720
in the first place he came up with a

00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,640
solution realized that's not very good

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,350
but we could do better I came up with

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,160
another iteration and often do that in

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:06,020
class and that's where I want to end the

00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,490
I don't know but let's see if we can

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,990
find out together because there's a

00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,820
whole lot to learn and hopefully Python

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,930
will give us opportunities to do that

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,930
thank you

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,740
