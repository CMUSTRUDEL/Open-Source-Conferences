Title: Rapid prototyping with teenagers by Katie Bell
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Education Miniconf
Description: 
	This is teamwork and rapid prototyping challenges on steroids. Imagine 15 high school kids, most of whom have only just learned to program, working together to design and build a fully functional social networking site in 3 days. 

This project is done as part of the NCSS (National Computer Science School) summer program. NCSS has been running for 20 years, and I've been involved in the last 7, so that's 6 different social networking sites (we used to build search engines, but apparently they're not cool anymore).

I'll go through the technical details, the tools we use, how the site functions, and how we structure the different pieces to come together. I'll also show off some extra fun projects we throw at the advanced kids, like building their own Django-like template engine, and secure hashing of passwords.

A lot of the challenge of this undertaking is inevitably also project management and coordination of the team. These students have never written tests before, don't know what version control is and don't understand what it means to agree on an API. Hilarity and frustration can (and does) ensue, especially during the last night, which is an all-nighter.

Come along to learn how to do project management with the least experienced team possible and how to hack together a functional prototype webapp with minimum effort.


PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,700
so next up we have Katie Bell katie is a

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,350
software developer for groc learning

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,050
really interesting to highlight that she

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,450
works mainly with teenagers and I don't

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,160
think any of us can understand the full

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,099
weight of how frustrating that must be

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:37,270
um so for her efforts and for being here

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:38,500
let's give her a round of applause so

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,900
the fun part of this is some of my

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,670
former students are in this room so put

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,449
your hand up if you've been at ncess yay

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,820
okay um so annoying teenagers droid no

00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:51,399
longer annoying teenagers hopefully okay

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,680
before I get started um can tell where I

00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,809
like I like this picture I want to plug

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,079
the ncss challenge if you know any

00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:01,149
students that is from grade 5 to 12 it

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,460
is interested in learning python the

00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,260
ncss challenge is starting on Monday it

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,510
is a five-week online programming

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,060
competition no prior experience required

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,670
learn Python as you go there is a block

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,799
based version of Python for the complete

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,970
rookies we're doing logo stuff this year

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,250
so you get to draw a little pretty

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,659
pictures of houses but I'm not going to

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,600
talk about the ncess challenge I'm going

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:24,729
to talk about the ncess summer school so

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,740
ncss stands for national computer

00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,470
science school we run both the

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,079
programming competition in August has in

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:36,670
starting Monday and we run a summer camp

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,799
in January called the summer school this

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,420
is run by Sydney University with the

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,000
support of a bunch of sponsors who are

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,149
all awesome i'll get to that a bit later

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,399
the camp runs for 10 days and we get

00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,770
about a hundred high school kids from

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,229
all over Australia and New Zealand plus

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,229
about 15 high school teachers depending

00:01:53,229 --> 00:02:00,369
on the year it is a fairly intense

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,530
program for those 10 days so we sort of

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,600
start with a lecture at nine a.m. in the

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,030
morning there's one hour lecture three

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,310
hours of lab time one hour lecture three

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,170
hours of lab time and then in the

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,180
evening we have evening activities until

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,660
10pm so the kids are pretty much full on

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,129
except for mealtimes right from nine

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,640
a.m. in the morning until 10pm at night

00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,500
when we tend them all to bed this means

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,570
that halfway through the camp

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,690
they're all a little bit dead and so we

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,360
have a sort of half a day off usually on

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,690
the Wednesday there and then the day

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,820
after that we spend a day visiting the

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,020
offices of a bunch of the sponsors of

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,060
the camp so last year this was google

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,650
atlassian and wise tech or great

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,410
sponsors to get the kids to see what

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,240
it's like to work in the industry but

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,790
pretty much these last three days is

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,380
what we have for the project clam so

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,660
going into a little bit more detail

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,480
about the tutorial time at the beginning

00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,950
this is when we are teaching pythons so

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,980
we get kids that come that have never

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,690
programmed before don't know anything

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,280
and this is the amount of time we have

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,010
to get them to the point where they can

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,650
start the project oh man we do that

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:16,270
using the groc learning interface to

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,130
teach them Python and so by the time we

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,200
get to actually starting the project we

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,810
have only three days left in which to do

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,700
it and this is the amount of time that

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:31,420
we have that last night there is an

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:34,269
all-nighter which is fun okay though we

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,950
chose this project because there are

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,580
three different my experience so we've

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,010
been running on the ncess summer camp

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,830
has been running for 20 years now it's

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,190
been teaching Python for about 16 or 17

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,580
of those years so back from Python one

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,280
point something and we've been running

00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,769
the social networking site as a project

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,750
as the main project for the last six

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,430
years and I've been involved in the last

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,959
seven years so before that we did search

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,310
engines apparently search engines aren't

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,769
cool anymore it's all about social

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,780
networking sites these days so we chose

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,160
this project to build a completely

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,070
functioning social networking site

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,170
because these are the three things that

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,209
I have found motivate kids to get

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,919
excited about programming and about

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,269
computer science different kids will

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,310
have different combinations of these

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,450
three things but ultimately you have

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,270
kids that are really excited about

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,520
learning how stuff works the stuff that

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,919
I use every day how does it actually

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,680
work on the inside what goes into making

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,870
it happen those kids get that get really

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,000
excited about building cool stuff unless

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,400
it looks like the things that they you

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,620
every day it's not cool enough sore

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,290
making text appear on the screen not

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,540
very exciting but building a site that I

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,370
can then show off to my friends that's

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,780
exciting and then those kids that don't

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,030
actually care about the other stuff they

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,740
care about the raw process of I have

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,190
this problem and I need to break it down

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,470
into steps and go through it and solve

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,910
puzzles that's kind of hard to avoid

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,000
with programming so we don't really need

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,240
to care about that one so the goal of

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,950
the project is to get the kids to build

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,160
a completely functioning social

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,350
networking site but without giving them

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,300
a bunch of tools that are just magic

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,280
that they don't understand how they work

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,660
there's no point having a function

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,880
that's like you run this function and

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,140
boom you have a website because the kids

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,560
don't learn anything that way they don't

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,470
learn how stuff works so the goal of

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,290
this project is basically to get as much

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,930
powerful cool stuff at the end as we can

00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,030
but still giving the kids the chance to

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,030
learn how all of the steps fit together

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:44,430
how the process works underneath the

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:46,870
hood so the term social network is

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,300
interpreted very loosely in this case

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,210
it's not the first year we ran this we

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,940
had each of the four groups each group

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,740
has about 12 or 15 kids in it each of

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,200
the four groups had a Facebook clone the

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,910
second year we ran it we got a lot more

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,800
interesting stuff we encourage the kids

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,360
to really broadly interpret what the

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,580
hell a social networking site could be

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,620
so we've had sites around planning group

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,590
presents this one is one of my favorites

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,110
it's a story building website where you

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,520
can submit a word and vote on which word

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,340
should come next in the story and

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,030
hopefully eventually develop a coherent

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,290
story but probably not and a couple of

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,960
other examples which we can go through

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,970
later we chose to use tornado because

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,690
it's fairly simple and lightweight we've

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:33,250
been using it for the last six years now

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:37,330
but the problem is the sort of hello

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,250
world tornado app is overly complicated

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,070
there's a lot of things on here that are

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,700
confusing and scary you have this kind

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,560
of giant line of nested things for

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,380
signing the I loop I all loop at the

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,689
bottom we have to define a class we have

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,099
only

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,049
three days to teach Python we don't

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,119
actually get up to teaching classes we

00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:57,349
skip over that so that's just confusing

00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:59,419
for the kids that have never done

00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,909
classes the whole concept of inheritance

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,249
is confusing so we've written our own

00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:07,669
little tornado wrapper that makes things

00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:11,209
much much simpler it is a very very

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:13,399
simple wrapper and it's just one line of

00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,189
Python so oh it's on one file of Python

00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:20,179
that's some easy so we have a fairly

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:22,579
easy a little web server here all it

00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:26,059
does is say hello world when you go to

00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:28,219
index um that's yeah I guess pretty

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:30,649
straightforward um here's an example

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:34,539
with HTML before you complain at me that

00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:38,689
is actually a valid html5 document and

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:41,899
sir it's a reasonably simple concept to

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,569
understand that when I go to this URL it

00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,759
calls this function and the HTML that is

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,829
returned but it was written to the

00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,209
response is the HTML that shows up in

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,469
the browser there's a lot of concepts to

00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,539
get here where you have to understand

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:56,239
this is a web server process running on

00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:59,499
your machine it sends HTML back to the

00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:01,879
browser and the browser displays it but

00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:03,619
that's pretty much as much magic as you

00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,079
get there you're still seeing okay yes

00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:08,239
the program is generating HTML and now I

00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,789
see the result of that HTML in the

00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:14,300
browser of course then you want to do

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:16,550
fancy things with logins and user

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,949
profiles and stuff so there's a bunch of

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,669
fairly simple functions to do things

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,919
like cookies to do things like form

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,959
fields from some form in HTML that's

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:31,129
then submitted and you can do things

00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,349
with that fairly simply um I'm gonna

00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:36,919
flip over to a live demo which is

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:40,419
obviously going to be risky no points

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,829
for web design here sorry about that um

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,139
okay so I have a little form this is a

00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,480
tiny HTML form you say my user name is

00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:50,209
Katie my full name is getting both and

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,670
then I can't submit my form and it adds

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:55,779
it to the user profile i can add another

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,189
one i'm lazy so i'm just going to type

00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,540
how is this stored in the background you

00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:02,870
think well I guess we have to go through

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,430
databases and SQL or something like that

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,000
in order to store things no

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,970
actually we have a step before that if

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,750
we can go to the next slide where we

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,399
teach the kids first let's do a

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,050
non-business how to pace where we store

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,410
everything in a giant dictionary as a

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,600
global variable we found that trying to

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,459
put in all of the different things HTML

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,899
form submitting things as well as the

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,110
database at the same time is a little

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:33,529
bit too much too fast so restoring staff

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,360
non persistently is a good way to get

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,740
that sort of process of the information

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,290
is flowing around the information is

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,649
being stored without this kind of magic

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,310
database thing to confuse things this of

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:50,120
course means that if I kill this server

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:53,270
and start it again then everything's

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,690
gone so we want to stop that it's kind

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,640
of hard to develop a good prototype of a

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,950
social networking site if you don't have

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,779
a persistent how to pace at all and we

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,339
found the best way of doing a database

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,839
is using SQLite this has a lot of

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,640
advantages that are reasonably obvious

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,500
it is powerful enough to do everything

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,779
that we want it to do it is mostly

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,430
understandable the end of the API could

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,529
be a little bit simpler but you can

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,360
actually see here is a physical file on

00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:19,160
my file system and that is my database

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,010
if I delete that file my database is

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,810
gone that's much easier to understand

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,130
then i have this process running in the

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,500
background that somehow serving my

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,650
database from some other complicated api

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,350
and of course it's built into Python so

00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,660
that makes it nice and simple you can

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,000
see here the picture is from one of our

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,310
ncess projects where we were planning

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,980
out the database structure and the

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,930
series of tables that were required for

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,190
that and this is something that I

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,440
thought would be a lot more difficult

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,459
for the kids to pick up but like

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,050
understanding that i have a table of

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,820
data and it's like a spreadsheet and

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,589
foreign keys seems to be actually

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,850
reasonably easy to grasp which is good

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,500
so that's pretty much all of the

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,920
components of the websites that we use

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,899
we end up with very simple tornado and

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,190
very simple sqlite database plug these

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,230
things together a bit of web design

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,510
shininess on the front end and you can

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,260
have a functioning site of course we get

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,700
a huge variety of backgrounds of the

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,660
kids that come to ncess for your kids

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,400
that have never program

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,140
before and kids that have been

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,430
programming since they were 8 and Lord

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,040
to show off to the other kids how

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,260
amazing they are programming so we have

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,240
a bunch of exciting extra projects for

00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,610
them the most interesting of which is

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,340
the template engine so you can see how

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,990
when you're doing the website how if

00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,180
you're actually manually constructing

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,250
your HTML in the Python code that's

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,930
going to get frustrating very quickly I

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,460
think it's important to get the kids to

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,170
learn the hard way of doing things

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,540
before we show them the magic easy way

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,850
of doing things so having a couple of

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,770
the more advanced kids take time out

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,250
from the project at the beginning to

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,570
write their own Django templating engine

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,220
gives them enough time for the other

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,740
kids to understand what the HTML is

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,250
doing then we say okay now let's use the

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,570
templating engine and that makes the

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,890
whole web development process much

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,320
simpler actually using a jegar

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,090
templating engine um this is a

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,680
particularly fun project for the kids

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,080
they get to learn all about context free

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,320
grammars and pausing it's an interesting

00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,540
problem I saw or talked yesterday about

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,100
building a dagger templating engine by

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:28,190
building by essentially translating it

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,420
into Python with the ast module um that

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,510
looks like a lot more fun I think we

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:35,750
might be doing that next year um other

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,430
extension projects that we do is we get

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,970
kids to think about security and sort of

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,140
safely storing passwords by hashing them

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,080
sometimes we get kids to sort of build a

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,510
layer around the database to make it

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,010
easier to find the current user that's

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,560
logged in in some kind of nice sort of

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,480
orem way this tends to make things a

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,430
little bit more magic for the other kids

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,930
that are only just understanding SQL so

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,870
sometimes this has turned out to be bad

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,810
for us but it is a good exercise for the

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,490
advanced kids often depending on the

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,440
particular social networking site that

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,260
you're building there's extra fun things

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,390
that you can do one year we had a site

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,560
that was about four primary school kids

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,150
to share what books they had been

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,800
reading so a couple of kids found a

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,100
while scraping Amazon to get a bunch of

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,060
book cover pictures to then fill up our

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,060
svn repo with

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,270
and of course you can add any little

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,750
sort of JavaScript dy things for again

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,670
for the more advanced kids so the other

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,410
fun part of this is everything I have

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,090
learned about project management I have

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,180
learned from running these projects that

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:42,530
enters us because when you have a room

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,900
full of kids who have um see if I can

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,320
get rid of that nope that's stuck there

00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,970
forever okay um when you have a room

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,560
full of kids I have vastly different

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,970
programming experience and even the kids

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,130
that have done a bunch of programming

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,020
experience before they've never worked

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,630
in a large group like doing a group

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,820
project where you have 12 to 15 kids all

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,260
working on the same thing is kind of

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,180
crazy none of the kids have done that

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,400
before they just don't have those team

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,560
working skills they don't understand

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,240
testing they don't understand that when

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,800
they write the code it doesn't

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,780
necessarily work the way that they

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,580
thought it was going to work and they've

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,890
never used version control before and

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,780
they don't know what an API is they

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,990
don't have an understanding that if i

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,310
write this function that it needs to be

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,080
easy enough for other people to

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,490
understand and that i cannot change that

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,960
function without going through and

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,330
checking if anyone is actually using

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,010
that function anywhere so having a

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,020
stable API is not something that they

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,240
even think about when they're building

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,680
their particular parts of the code so we

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,440
sort of need to teach them all of these

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,800
concepts as we go through and it's

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,750
that's pretty fun um we do use version

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,150
control that is something that we've

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,730
learned the first time back when we were

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,770
still doing the search engine project we

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,420
didn't use version control and I really

00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:00,950
glad we stopped using fresh and control

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:03,080
um we have been using svn the last six

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,650
years last year was my first year using

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,310
git and it turned into a horrible mess

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,450
um so I think we'll try get again

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,339
probably but we're going to be

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,070
extraordinarily careful how we do that

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:20,510
this year because we spent a lot of time

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:23,240
resolving merge conflicts last year we

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,190
find that in terms of coming up with

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,630
ideas for the project it's important to

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,950
have a big group discussion at the

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,510
beginning so that all of the kids feel

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,800
involve all of the kids contribute ideas

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,230
all of the kids feel that sense of

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,060
ownership over the project but group

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,779
decisions are really really slow so you

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,499
want to avoid do

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:41,420
not as much as possible using simple

00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,920
tools is really important we did at some

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,899
point experiment with using wiki's and

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,550
with using bug trackers they turned out

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,589
to be a complete waste of time when you

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,019
have all of the kids in one room for

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,879
three days it's much much easier to have

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,430
a list of bugs on the whiteboard that

00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,170
you cross out when they're done um then

00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,629
it is to use any kind of bug tracking

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,569
system it's much simpler and of course

00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,709
you have to tell the kids you need if

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:05,629
you need to know how this part of the

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,309
system works you need to go over to Amy

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,199
over there because she wrote that system

00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:11,059
and you need to ask her to keep telling

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,290
them to go talk to each other at least

00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:13,639
for the first couple of days and then

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,850
they get the idea that they have to go

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,649
talk to each other um the other thing we

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,769
learned is to make sure that the site is

00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,329
working mostly at least partially at

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,339
every point in time you want to get

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,959
something that is serving a web page

00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,999
right at the beginning and then go from

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,470
there and constantly have something that

00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:34,579
is at least in some sense of the word

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:37,459
working what we do during ncess we have

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:40,339
one of the tutors usually Tim released

00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:42,079
in the last couple of years who is the

00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,240
one that comes around all of the groups

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,389
at specific times and says I'm going to

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,870
be here at this time and I want to see a

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,100
demo at this time okay and so we ride up

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,930
on the whiteboard the time that he's

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,189
coming and then as it gets closer to

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
that time who kids are frantically

00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:58,519
trying to fix things that are broken so

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,649
that they have a working demo by the

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,149
time he arrives one year the kids

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,110
barricaded themselves in one of the

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,819
computer labs they couldn't come in um

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:10,760
and we find that's a really good

00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,140
motivator they get very excited when the

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,750
Tudor comes and everything is working

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,980
and he finds bugs and then they put the

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,280
bugs on the whiteboard it's a good

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,720
process the other thing is when you

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,699
introduce a new things such as the

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,949
templating engine or hey now the

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,780
database is ready to be used you need to

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,159
stop all of the kids and explain it to

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,080
them all together and give them the

00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:31,399
chance to ask questions we've sort of

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,399
had a little bit of hit and miss with

00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:35,809
this in the past when you you don't want

00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:38,659
to interrupt the kids when they're all

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,679
working away happily and if you

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,669
interrupt them too often they're

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,730
obviously not going to get anything done

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,200
but it does slow things down a lot if

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,640
you have to keep explaining the same

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,220
things over and over again so it's also

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,750
important to stop progress let's

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,030
gather together let's all learn about

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,340
this new thing let's get the same idea

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,799
of where we're headed into everyone's

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,210
head at the same time so then we can go

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,640
back and work and we're all working in

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,200
the same direction with the same goals

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
and the other thing is if anything does

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,380
get working you know that sort of yes

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,390
moment where you click the web page of

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,760
it does the right thing and it looks

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,520
good then you cheer you gather everyone

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,049
around to see it they see that bit yes

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,570
that bit of the site is working now our

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,820
site is making progress it's very

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,200
encouraging so some examples of sites

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,770
that have come out in the last couple of

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:29,179
years mrs. opus this was originally like

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,830
a progress pictures of a like hands-on

00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,590
project that you're working on so the

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,850
puppy pictures are just for a

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,260
demonstration of where the pictures

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,500
should go but they're cute so they're

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,929
good so essentially showing progress

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,850
pictures and sharing what you're working

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,010
on is a fairly loose interpretation of a

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,750
social networking site this one I think

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,970
was originally called forking stories

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,909
but changed its name to word by word as

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,070
you're building up stories with words

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,200
and voting on which word in which path

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:02,470
of the story is the one that you want to

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,470
continue this one was a one about

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,539
sharing enthusiasm for a particular

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,909
fandom so instead of just having a sort

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,470
of Lord of the Rings movie fan side it

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,760
would be Lord of the Rings movie and the

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,039
books and Hobart in some kind of

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,110
fictional world to be able to group

00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,850
fandoms and enthusiasm around a

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,700
fictional world in a different way to

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,760
what everyone else is doing cloud shelf

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,809
the name is a an example of why group

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,370
decision making is a terrible idea um

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:33,679
that was a very controversial decision

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,150
and no one was happy with that name so

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,309
just to reiterate this is the sort of

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,870
core thing that I want to get home these

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,280
are the things these are the three

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,260
different things that really get kids

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,620
excited about learning programming at

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,080
about learning computer science if you

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,299
can cover all of these things that's

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,980
really awesome right you'll get a whole

00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:55,580
bunch of kids excited it is very

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,289
difficult to do this well because the

00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,360
learning how stuff works in building

00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:01,309
cool stuff is often very much at odds

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,870
with each other how much magic versus

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,440
how quickly can you get something

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:08,270
civ so we try and sort of balance these

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,650
things if you end up getting only one of

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,360
these things for a particular group of

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,920
kids then that's also really cool

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,550
because that will get some of those kids

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,680
excited about programming the last plug

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:21,080
for the ncss challenge and also for

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,270
teachers coming to ncess the summer camp

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,150
if you know anyone that is a teacher

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:30,520
tell them about it um we're very excited

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:33,860
about that and we're also yes for the

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,360
ncess challenge it is starting on Monday

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,240
if you know anyone that knows anyone

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,610
that has kids in the grades 5 to 12 kind

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,400
of range then and you want them to learn

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,400
to program then I go for that

00:20:51,769 --> 00:21:01,830
okay we've got some time for questions

00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:04,620
are there any questions yes salut hi

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:07,380
thanks for the talk I guess my question

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,539
is maybe a little bit silly but what

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,330
have you kind of learned from working

00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,370
with kids or teenagers versus working

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,730
with adults like can you contrast your

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,210
experiences and like right who's good at

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,039
what and sort of like how they did for

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,480
um there is a very different

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,769
relationship like working with a group

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,690
of kids and working with a group of

00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,919
adults I'm the only adults I've worked

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,059
with have been professional software

00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,220
engineers who already know how to

00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,899
program and are being paid to be there

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,129
and do their job and have been going

00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:38,009
through gone through some kind of hiring

00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:42,570
process I'm working with kids is a very

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:45,320
different story because there there's

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,220
there's nothing kind of that they have

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,360
you have to do with a whole different

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,490
set of problems where they are very

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,100
distracted by things like last year we

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,679
had one kid that spent the whole time

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,200
playing with Rubik's cubes um because it

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,669
seemed to help him think somehow it's

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:08,730
very distracting talking to someone when

00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:10,980
they're like um yep so mostly just the

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,360
the complete lack of experience is the

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,529
biggest thing that comes up like you

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,419
they don't know how to work together

00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,740
they don't know the processes involved

00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,059
with sulfur development they don't know

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,100
any of these things they have to learn

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,899
everything as they go and at some point

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,700
during this very intense camp they

00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:25,139
occasionally they just burn out and they

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,149
need a bit of a break before they can

00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:29,639
keep going um I've never encountered

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:31,440
that in the sort of I mean burnout does

00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,850
happen in the software industry but

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,320
usually you and you're working sort of

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,519
very calm nine to five hours and that

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,509
doesn't happen quite so much as when

00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,830
you're halfway through an all-nighter

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,330
and it's three o'clock in the morning

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,269
and your site doesn't work and someone

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,279
breaks down in tears um that's yeah it's

00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:48,450
a very different environment does that

00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,799
ask you a question I'm not entirely sure

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,179
like it's a very broad question there is

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,379
a lot of differences between working

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,389
with adults and working with teenagers

00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,220
but a large part of that is the

00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,690
completely different environment that

00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,669
you're in I think if we got a bunch of

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,889
adults who are all completely new

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,260
programmers doing exactly the same

00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:06,630
project with exactly the same timeframe

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,010
um it would be very similar to working

00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,940
with the teenagers except that they

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,350
would be a little bit more professional

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:17,700
about it Thank You Katie it was a

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:20,160
fantastic talk the idea of specification

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,810
and you know going through together and

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,700
developing features and what the user

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:27,090
stories are going to be is that covered

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,260
at all in things you do so the idea of

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,240
like actually planning out what are the

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,280
requirements yes sir yeah I didn't

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
really cover that very much that kind of

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,090
brainstorming session that we go through

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,650
at the beginning where we come up with

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,380
ideas for what kind of social networking

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:46,590
site do we want to build if I go all the

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:51,690
way back to the schedule duder duder too

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:54,900
many slides um this first project

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,760
session over there that is that sort of

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,830
three-hour block we don't do any code

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,750
usually that's all about planning what

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,090
the project is going to be the first

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,590
thing we do is sort of building a whole

00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,180
ton of ideas what are the possible

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,700
things that we could do we narrow it

00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,290
down to one kind of idea for what the

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,040
social networking site should be about

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,300
and then we emphasize really strongly

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,220
Minimum Viable Product what is the

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,800
minimum set of things that we need to

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,070
implement do you have something that it

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,390
works and fulfills our purpose um so in

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,530
that case we come up with what is the

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,380
minimum set of things that we need to

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,590
need it to do and we do only those first

00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,570
and often during the camp we get only to

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:40,170
that point where we just have a Minimum

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:42,060
Viable Product hi where is a voice

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,390
coming from mess okay I have a nephew

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,700
who I've always known he'd you know be a

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:51,300
programmer but throughout his childhood

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,620
he just never really got it he did I tea

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,960
at school and that bordered on criminal

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,630
negligence you know what there's no no

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,550
programming at all and the only good

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,040
thing is I to teacher told him about was

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,720
the ncess and he went there it

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,580
completely changed everything and he

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,300
absolutely loved it what's his excited

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:12,050
Sean Ferguson he was there last year yep

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,490
he wasn't in my group but yes and and

00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,710
yeah I had a wonderful time got really

00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,670
excited and this year is season first

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,980
year at CD universe

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:26,490
and they've got him doing Java what went

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:27,660
wrong ah so um interestingly enough at

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,280
Sydney University there are two

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,110
different intruder intro to programming

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,230
subjects one of them is Java the other

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,300
one is Python um so yeah you'll be doing

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:41,670
both yes yes I learned java in first

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:45,690
year of university as well um yes that

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:48,210
is a bit disappointing but um yeah um

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,920
thanks again the at the beginning you

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,390
mentioned that you have to have a

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,410
project that the kids engage with

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,910
because if it doesn't look like what

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,410
they've got on a day-to-day basis they

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,510
just don't click with it so that's why

00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,280
you saw sara lee true and that's kind of

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,170
the point of this like some kids for

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,180
some kids that's really really important

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,610
time um but for a lot of kids they're

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,380
happy building things that don't

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,000
actually need to look like the things

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,950
that they use every day right okay

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,260
White's by those kids in particular but

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,060
even this more generally your first demo

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,280
is exactly what every first demo of a

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,260
website looks like it's HTML native

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,790
rendering of forms that don't line up

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,720
and all the rest of it but by the end it

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,300
looks like you've got to something

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,920
there's pretty polished yeah are they

00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,480
learning these design skills as well as

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,000
they go are they being coached a app

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,980
designers or and it is the fact that the

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,350
first thing they produce is butt-ugly

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,670
does that is that a disincentive to

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,110
anybody or is it just hey look I've got

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,520
something on the web page that is enough

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,330
to get them going to the next pick

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,670
gotcha um that is a good question so we

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:48,210
do have arm again going back to the

00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,800
schedule in the the lecture times as we

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,540
get into the sort of project phase of

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,960
the cam the lectures split into

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,640
different streams through there is a

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,890
introduction to HTML and CSS sort of web

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,900
design lecture and then after that there

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,970
are both Python and web design lectures

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,150
and what we find is some of the kids by

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,710
this stage or getting other with as they

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,180
get excited about the project the thing

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,160
that they're excited about is the web

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,720
design aspect and so we always get them

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,920
to do a little bit of the coding but

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,960
often there'll be a couple of kids that

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,120
almost entirely spend their time on the

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,820
web design we are lucky enough to have a

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,230
bunch of the tutors who are a couple of

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,840
the judo's i would say i should say it's

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,120
not enough of them who are professional

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,220
web designers who go around to all of

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,520
the groups and help the kids make these

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,100
really nice polish

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,170
designs that being said we did not have

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,270
any particularly good web designers in

00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:40,900
my group last year and this is the site

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:43,060
that we ended up with um it work spans

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,810
very clearly not particularly shiny um

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,130
and yes again this is something that

00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,540
matters for some kids and more than

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,830
others and there's usually at least a

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,780
couple of kids that are very excited

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,570
about the web design even if they're not

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,220
particularly good at it yeah they really

00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,230
liked it there really excited about like

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,640
the color scheme and everything this

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:05,980
game this is pretty fun does anyone know

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:16,890
the answer to this it's actually not by

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:16,890
dinner boa constrictor you guys are good

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,480
yeah anyway so this was the project that

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,860
my group made last year yeah so yes you

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,960
can see the web design is not that but

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,310
um we do yeah I yeah I didn't really

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,010
cover that in the talk but because I

00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:43,480
tend to stay away from the web design

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,920
because that is not my thing but yeah

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,590
there is a series of talks that go

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,580
through good design principles

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,560
constructing a wireframe choice of

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,760
colors that kind of stuff we are we are

00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,350
lucky enough to have a professional web

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,690
designer who goes to who does those

00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:01,450
lectures yeah oh yeah me at the back AV

00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,970
person sure um you said that there's a

00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:08,290
huge range of abilities and previous

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,730
experience and stuff how so programmers

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,440
can be arrogant and I've never found

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,420
that being a teenager definitely helps

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,510
of that yes yes this is extraordinarily

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:20,020
how do you deal with people who are not

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,340
as confident like being in or of people

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,360
who have much more experience and so on

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,220
how do you deal with that sort of stuff

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,660
that is a really difficult problem to

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,360
deal with this was something that I

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,890
experienced when I started University so

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,540
I went to an all-girls school and it was

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,850
not a lot of people there who were like

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,440
hardcore programmers and I was I thought

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,720
like at the point where i left school

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,460
that I'm like amazing at programming so

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,290
good I know everything and then I went

00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,910
to university and like we started

00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,050
learning java and I'd never developed

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,270
with object-oriented stuff with

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,650
so I'm like trying to understand

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,300
everything and the person sitting next

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,030
to me is like why are we learning java

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,500
already know Java oh and he was also

00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,110
like working part-time as a software

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,220
developer and like I'm like maybe I

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,040
shouldn't be doing computer science

00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,130
because clearly i'm really behind so I

00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,240
understand this problem yes and it is

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,980
daunting especially for the kids that

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,750
come from a school where there they are

00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,640
the computer genius and they come to

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,350
ncss and there are these amazing kids

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,940
that have already got a lot of

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,150
experience that are always trying to

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,720
show off to each other a lot of that is

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:22,390
the tutors get really involved in

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,490
encouraged in developing a culture where

00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,040
everyone is encouraged to learn and push

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,870
themselves and it's important to get the

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,810
kids to participate and contribute to

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,370
the project together rather than there

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,900
are always some kids that are like I

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,490
don't know anything I clearly can't

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,940
contribute give me something that's not

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,290
important and we say no you're going to

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,300
work on this part of the system this is

00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,360
the core part of the sort of user

00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,190
profile page you need to do this I will

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,490
sit here and help you so we're very

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:54,220
lucky to have a tutor to student ratio

00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:57,400
of about 1 to 4 sometimes even one two

00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:00,310
three ish somewhere in the middle so we

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,870
do actually have enough tutors so that

00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,850
if someone is really struggling they can

00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:07,240
have someone sit with them and go

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:10,540
through stuff so that gives us a real

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,270
advantage in keeping everyone moving and

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,330
keeping everyone engaged in learning it

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:18,640
is a problem that they see other people

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,890
who are clearly way ahead of them and

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,990
there's no real way to avoid that but we

00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:25,240
try and encourage that is because they

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,770
have been doing this for a long time you

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,840
can get to that point too it's actually

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,030
not that hard to catch up I have spent

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,530
many an ncess over lunchtime over dinner

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,880
talking to the students about my own

00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,730
experience of being completely

00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:41,800
intimidated and then catching up over a

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:44,170
period of years do you do any incursions

00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,040
into schools and teach within the

00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:49,120
classroom environment um yes and no so

00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,220
I've been involved in a couple of things

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,280
that are fairly separate to ncess where

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,930
I've gone into schools and run workshops

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,950
and stuff it is a very different

00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,510
environment when you're

00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,340
school with a class of students that

00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,049
don't necessarily want to be there

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,370
unlike ncss where they have willingly

00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:07,809
given up their holidays to be there and

00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,309
you need to be a little bit more careful

00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,440
and be a little bit more hand-holding

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:14,289
and take things at a slower pace in that

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,740
case yeah but I haven't had a lot of

00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:18,880
experience of classroom teaching okay

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,590
we'll have to leave it there with

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,730
questions because lunchtime is starting
