Title: Open edX: An edX partner perspective by John Zornig
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Education Miniconf
Description: 
	Open edX is an open source MOOC platform. It powers courses on edx.org and those of the many adopters of the Open edX platform. Open edX is a complex platform with many interconnected parts, but the largest components are Python Django apps. 
This presentation will describe the experiences of developers at The University of Queensland's UQx project from 2013 when UQ joined the edX consortium through to the present and the future. Your presenters are John Zornig, Director UQx (former Senior Architect) and Andrew Dekker Senior Developer.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

so it isn't just schools programmers and

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,740
publishers that see new opportunities in

00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:20,150
online education john zorn egg and

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,980
andrew decorah here from the university

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,270
of queensland two desserts the

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,730
university's involvement in the

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:33,079
development and deployment of the open

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:35,810
EDX online education platform nice to be

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:41,480
here I'm John John this is andrew my

00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:45,250
senior developer so uqx stands for UQ's

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:51,079
involvement in the EDX project EDX is a

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:55,429
non-profit set up by MIT at bottom and

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:58,519
Harvard to fairly large and prestigious

00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:01,460
universities in the US who both entered

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:06,920
independently the new world of MOOCs

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:09,830
back in about 2011 and decided to get

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,800
together pool their resources

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:18,410
and create this nonprofit at X in 2012

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,650
to explore the MOOC phenomena and feed

00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:26,030
back into their universities EDX set

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:29,330
about creating a consortium of global

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,520
universities that wanted to engage and

00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,450
uq was one of the very first

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,500
universities to sign up as a member of

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:43,729
the EDX consortium we joined in 2013

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:48,100
that may and the project got started the

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,590
project now is a bit over dozen people

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,230
we have

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,580
videographers animators learning

00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:01,610
designers project managers and technical

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,360
developers originally I was the senior

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,240
architect and that data czar I've since

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,700
moved to being the director Andrews

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,860
recently been our senior developer and

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,770
most of this stuff will be talking about

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,570
is things that Andrew has been mostly

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,960
involved in coding because I don't get

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,170
much chance to code anymore

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:26,590
this is what a typical EDX MOOC looks

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,800
like 12 MOOC platforms both in the

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,620
university sphere and in professional

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,500
education business all sorts of areas

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,090
there are national MOOC platforms in

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,840
various countries that are running on

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,820
this open EDX is basically the open

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,190
source MOOC platform for anyone that

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,770
wants to create a platform for

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,770
large-scale online learning

00:02:51,470 --> 00:03:00,020
when uqa when you joined EDX on my foot

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:03,140
the role I'd had it uq prior to that

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,770
point was as a learning tools developer

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,720
and one of the technologies we've been

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:12,110
using in our learning tools development

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,830
was learning tools interoperability ims

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:20,000
global standard and when we visited EDX

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:22,520
just after we joined they found out that

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,900
I was an LTI expert and so the first

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,570
engagement we had with the platform was

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:33,500
to demonstrate to them how easily it was

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:39,260
to get LTI integration into the the EDX

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:42,560
platform and that day the EDX office is

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,480
just outside of MIT in Cambridge and the

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,070
US was the first day I'd actually

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,350
written a line of Python code because I

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,709
done most of my work in PHP and other

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,560
languages prior to that but the EDX

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:01,310
platform is primarily a python django

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,500
based set of applications does have some

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,370
components in Ruby on Rails and various

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,250
other bits and pieces because

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:12,269
it's a very large piece of software but

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,199
our first integration was platform being

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,419
able at forum was in developing LTI

00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:22,979
integration for it and contributing that

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:28,830
because we had expertise now so how do

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:33,750
we use at X there are basically two

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:38,340
worlds software as a service which is

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:44,150
edx.org that's could wear member we use

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:47,610
the NX hosted platform we don't run EDX

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:51,000
software ourselves in cube other than

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,820
Android runs it as his development but

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,550
we don't we deploy everything to edx.org

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,030
which is effectively a cloud service for

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,590
us but all the other users of platform

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,539
use open EDX they deployed their own

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,470
with that rather than the cloud or host

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,250
of themselves and

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:16,540
see some of the differences the base

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,540
package is saying

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:34,140
so I will hand over to Andrew to talk

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:38,010
more about the Real Techniques so

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,880
basically with the this has John said

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,650
there's two worlds so a lot of help a

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,090
lot of universities will actually just

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,790
spin up their own instance of that X

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,380
style it customize it as far as the

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,570
world's concerned it's not a tax but

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,750
behind the scenes it is whereas what we

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,360
do is we work directly with EDX which

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,280
has a heap of benefits marketing etc we

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,850
don't have to advertise anyone that goes

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,140
to edx.org can find it etc but there's

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,210
problems with that as well so this is an

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:13,170
example of the EDX architecture so it's

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,510
built for scale it runs primarily on AWS

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:19,590
and it uses pretty much every AWS

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:23,220
service they have so it's fairly intense

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,590
and as John said and it's probably not

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,970
obvious here but most of the components

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:36,510
are Django based and it uses SQL and

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:38,670
 primarily for the back end so when

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,950
working with that X we primarily work

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,140
with them directly contributing to the

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,880
core through github they have a hepa

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,150
repositories the main one is the EDX

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,270
platform and how many people here are

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:55,800
developers just out of curiosity about

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:59,310
50 50 ok so this kind of repository is

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,320
massive and continually changing and the

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,180
developers in the room you can see

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,750
there's like thirty one thousand commits

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,230
and 860 branches so actually finding out

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,450
what's going on is often difficult but

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:16,290
that being said it's a very active code

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:18,380
branch so what we can do is we can

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,630
develop a new learning tool feature

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,850
submit that to EDX work through them

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:27,420
with the details and as soon as that's

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,190
done that's now available on EDX org not

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,920
only for us but for all the partner

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,050
institutions and any other

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,030
institutions that are running open EDX

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,310
they can use that functionality as well

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,170
so it's a way that can we can build

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,760
software that not only works for us but

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:49,650
we can contribute it to the larger

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:52,500
community so that's already set so just

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,860
to give you a quick kind of insight into

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,060
how uq works with kind of addicts and at

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,550
the end of the day what we're trying to

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560
do is we're trying to build courses to

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,470
teach people around the world about

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,450
certain topics and to do that EDX has

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,150
some components built in but often we

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,310
have to generate our own tools like our

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,700
own simulations our own animations to

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,380
really kind of get the concepts across

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,740
so we work with academics to find out

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,030
what they're learning objectives are and

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,850
then with that X you have a heap of

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:28,890
different options so the quick and dirty

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,860
version is essentially JavaScript

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:34,530
enhancements we're similar to WordPress

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,810
you can put some code in some JavaScript

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:41,760
code you can hack at it you can stall it

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:44,490
make it do what you want then as John

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,650
mentioned we often use LTI which if

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,990
people haven't used it before and their

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,450
developers essentially it's I framing an

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,730
external site in and there's a simple

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,920
kind of old worth based API behind the

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,550
scenes that's kind of communicating who

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,310
the user is the LTI tool can send back

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,960
what grade they got for the tool etc and

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,180
finally X blocks which is the add X

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,010
component architecture and Django so

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,110
it's built on top of Django and it's a

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,450
way that you can silo build your little

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,110
tool and then it integrates with the

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,110
rest of the platform

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,120
so when you're working with EDX as a

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,130
learning designer or as an academic you

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,140
basically get I'm going to make a new

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,600
page and then I can place components on

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,790
that page and you get this little kind

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,339
of drop down so you can do problems you

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,320
can insert a video insert some social

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,899
functionality or there's an advanced

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,640
tool so when you're going to advance

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,920
you're actually going to all these

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:55,750
different xblock components that are

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:59,260
available in the system so this is

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:03,180
theoretically and kind of the best way

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:06,160
to contribute to the X and EDX however

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,160
you develop your ex block so EDX

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,279
actually has a xbox testbed and an xbox

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,370
SDK repositories available on github so

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,500
you can download that build your own

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,200
then you have to test your ex block with

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,850
the EDX platform and then you have to

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,660
integrate your ex block into the code

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,000
place once all that's done that's pretty

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,430
much all the coding worked on but then

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,089
you have to work through addicts which

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:38,380
can actually be fairly time consuming as

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,730
because ethics is a partnership across

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,279
all the universities all the

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,770
universities have their own ideas on how

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,779
a sudden learning objective or a tool

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,390
should be developed and what does she

00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,290
give the users experience so that's a

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,839
lot of back and forth code review and

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,520
then hopefully once you've built your ex

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,310
block you've got it deployed back into

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,920
addicts they've accepted it then one day

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:09,850
it will show up as an available option

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:13,390
in the EDX platform so an alternative

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:16,209
process so EDX isn't a sorry Stanford

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,839
isn't a addicts partner as such however

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:22,390
they do use open EDX to run a lot of

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,540
their online courses so alternatively

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,300
EDX basically forked so our Stanford

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,540
forks at X does their own things and

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,160
then at some point in the future they

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,290
push back to addicts and then why

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,480
through the integration issues so

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,459
although Stanford for example isn't an

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,519
ad ex-partner they're still contributing

00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:44,829
to the platform so it's a diverse

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,170
community people are working with that X

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,060
in different ways but overall it's a

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,769
platform that's kind of being built up

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,810
by many different partners so just a

00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:59,649
quick example of one of the things that

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,990
we did recently was EDX always had a

00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:05,649
tool called the open response which

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:09,009
would let students answer a question in

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:11,920
a long form kind of essay style and then

00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:16,990
get it marked through peers so we could

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,060
ask talk about Australia in the 1900s a

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,220
student would write a response and then

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,680
their response would get sent to three

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,680
different peers they would market give

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,509
comments and come back cetera so one of

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,490
the things that we wanted through our

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:34,290
academics was the development of the

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:37,810
leaderboard so rather than just having

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,610
these open responses that really have no

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,350
impact at the end you kind of wrote it

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,300
submitted it and you've got some grades

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,100
back at the end you had no feeling of

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,240
how you fitted within the rest of the

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,430
cohort so for this because the open

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,589
response was an x-block and of course

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,230
open source we could pull it down we can

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,589
modify it we could go back through EDX

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:02,350
and deploy it so that's just an example

00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,240
of how EDX is a platform that you can

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,490
actually work on unlike things like

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:13,300
Coursera or Udacity where they kind of

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:15,009
locked off and then one of the big

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,449
functionalities that we're trying to get

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:19,589
at the moment that we think will be

00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:23,230
incredibly useful for universities is

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:26,470
being able to embed parts of an addict

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:30,579
scores back into standard LMSs such as

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,649
blackboard or Moodle so rather than just

00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:35,319
addicts being this all-consuming thing

00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:37,720
that takes content from other sources we

00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:40,569
can actually take EDX and plug it back

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,829
into the university systems so that's

00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,680
one of the things that we're working on

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,060
at the moment

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,180
we're working on in conjunction with

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,980
Harvard and a few other places but again

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,570
it's one of those things where every

00:13:49,980 --> 00:14:00,779
University has a different idea about

00:13:51,570 --> 00:14:02,910
what they want come on so what does it

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,810
all mean do you want to go through this

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:09,120
would so one of the things when we

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,910
started looking into this much space is

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,029
what does it mean in a classroom you can

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,010
actually gauge the intention of an

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,300
audience you can understand how your

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,040
students are progressing through the

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,250
content but as soon as you take that

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,930
online you kind of lose that connection

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,370
discussion forums kind of help but it

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,610
only really helps with the engaged

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:33,170
students so one of the things that we're

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,220
working on fairly heavily is the

00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,829
constructing a system for doing learning

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,949
analytics on top of that acts so EDX

00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:44,970
provides us with raw database dumps and

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:47,970
clickstream logs but that really doesn't

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,670
mean too much however we've developed

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,790
this platform which again is open source

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:56,579
and the links at the end which allows us

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,250
to break down the data that's in attics

00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,519
and actually start to pull out some

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,829
useful analytics so we've built a

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,529
dashboard the dashboards not only for us

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:09,149
we're hoping that other addicts partners

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,620
and pretty much anyone that can find it

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:16,500
useful can take it on adapt it it uses a

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,970
fairly standard architecture so it has a

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,640
Python ingestion system which then turns

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,260
itself into a REST API and then from

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,660
that we have dashboard visualizations

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,420
that can be plugged in so we've designed

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,750
this not only for our internal usage but

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,490
also a REST API so that academics other

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,250
researchers can take this data and

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,670
actually understand what does it mean to

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,010
be a student within a MOOC how do you

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,199
tell if a student is actually engaged in

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,199
a MOOC and why are they dropping out

00:15:49,290 --> 00:16:00,759
and we don't know the answer yet so

00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:03,310
that's me MOOCs are pretty big we've got

00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:07,870
a course on English grammar and style

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:12,370
which started on Sunday it had 66,000

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:15,459
enrollees on some day today it should

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,800
later this afternoon past 75,000 for

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:21,150
getting roughly two thousand two and a

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,670
half thousand enrollments a day at the

00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,010
and it's not being now most popular

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:30,450
calls the most popular course two dates

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,730
had 128,000 enrollments we've got a

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,720
course coming out in November that we

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,200
hope will maybe be in the multiple

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,030
hundred thousand so it's a course for

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,630
students learning English as a Second

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,670
Language so global appeal EDX will

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:52,410
already have over four million enroll

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,120
users so I'm looking forward to the

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,530
first book that has more than million

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,870
students in one course so that's pretty

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,460
scalable and you consider that you cued

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,910
the biggest course would be 1200

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,910
students

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,520
is Python we use part of the day in day

00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:15,030
out we also do a fair bit of stuff in

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,790
front end in JavaScript

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:22,510
but I think there's platforms a very

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:25,060
significant platform software because

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,490
it's it's kind of a scalable internet

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,730
business that you know all the software

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:35,990
is available for anyone to use and apply

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:39,890
to an education sub niche

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,530
that might support a new business or a

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,650
menial nonprofit there are a lot of

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,410
nonprofits members and headaches people

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,730
like the International Monetary Fund

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,730
linux foundation is a member

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,410
the platform's getting a lot of adoption

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,410
so any questions

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:19,799
so any questions

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:19,799
who's Donovan probably hyphen linux

00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:33,690
just out of interest because you were

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:39,059
talking about xbox and component

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:41,820
architecture two questions how do you

00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:46,799
configure and register additional

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:48,720
components and when these when the

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,549
component architecture was built have

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,070
you guys looked into other component

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:59,580
architectures in the Python world yes

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,620
sir in terms of the X block architecture

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,759
EDX kind of mandates that for the most

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:10,980
part so when there when we go to build

00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,690
the feature so let me find it often we

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,279
have multiple types of architectures

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,419
that we can use in terms of developing

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,909
our tools often because of the the

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:24,149
pragmatic implications of going through

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:26,399
code review and academics asking us to

00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:30,409
do stuff at the last minute they're kind

00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:34,320
of incompatible the X block architecture

00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:37,710
it's just it it's a standard the EDX has

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,929
developed its not directly tied to EDX

00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:44,490
and they make the SDK and the kind of

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:46,740
protocols open source so there's a four

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,649
or five github repos that are all about

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:54,480
xbox so they are trying to push it out

00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:58,019
to the other MOOCs and other kind of the

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,409
other learning tool providers kind of

00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:07,070
this sub industry of strange protocols

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:07,070
that learning learning systems years

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,600
given the section of the page to render

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:20,640
and the architecture basically sandboxes

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,940
any javascript with that the X block

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,900
generates from the rest of the page so

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,450
that you can run a platform with xblocks

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,850
contributed by other people and still

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:39,100
have a certain level of security about

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:42,130
things behaving properly yeah i mean the

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,990
the x block architect show because a

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,060
little bit of other django stuff as well

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,480
it doesn't fit entirely into Django's

00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,460
kind of best practices but it seems in

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,790
the context of EDX it actually works

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,550
fairly well in San boxing that kind of

00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,020
tool from the rest of the platform so

00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,460
you're not dealing with the platforms

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,460
strangeness on top of

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:20,610
the student in the course and the cohort

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:22,800
actually yeah yeah but I mean one thing

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,530
I would say and this is from me kind of

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,600
coming from not really interacting that

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,720
much with open source projects is that

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,250
addicts because it's so visible on the

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
net especially in these learning

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,450
environments it's actually a really good

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,460
way to kind of get yourself into working

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,050
on an open source project because

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,810
there's a really active community and

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,790
very visible and there's a lot of very

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,580
simple functionality that just isn't

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,300
there yet so low hanging fruit for

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,300
anyone that's interested

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,070
I had a question about your dashboard

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,560
the most interesting thing I think from

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,490
my perspective about the effect on you Q

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:10,130
is what's the effect of these courses on

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,770
you Q or what does uq look like in 10

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:24,200
years time sort of more a moot question

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:26,810
than a thinner EDX question yeah thats

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,940
that's one of the big questions as you

00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:33,500
know director of the unit that you know

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:35,990
we have to struggle with is justifying a

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,730
the expense of developing these courses

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,560
but working out what the business model

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,010
is and what the contribution to the

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,810
university is so as a purely marketing

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,640
exercise that they're actually not all

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,240
that expensive considering the number of

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,590
people we reach and the things we've

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,830
been finding out about the demographics

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:58,670
of the people we're reaching with the

00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,920
individual courses means that we can

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,960
actually tailor courses to reach

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:08,270
specific demographics around the globe

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,920
we tell people that we engineer our

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:15,380
courses rather than just you know bang a

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,540
bunch of content in there and we go

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,670
through a big process of defining who we

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,210
think of the target markets and things

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,830
like this before we even you know get

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:27,800
down to you know what are the learning

00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,350
goals for the course and and into those

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,420
sorts of areas of design so there's huge

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,200
potential in the future and you know

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,310
online learning is growing massively

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,630
especially in the developed world where

00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:43,400
the middle class is generating demand

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,770
for higher education faster than

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:51,110
universities can be physically built so

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:54,320
in China India Africa online learning

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,480
will be a major component of higher

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,750
education because they will have no

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,990
other option so for a large part of the

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:05,990
globe students in the future will be

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,759
prepped to expect higher education via

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,849
online

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,190
and if we can provide it from Australia

00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:14,259
rather than providing education as an

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,539
export by getting students to come here

00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:20,469
with their money they can stay there and

00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:25,079
just you know by courses through paypal

00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:25,079
or whatever so

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,940
cool thanks

00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,179
