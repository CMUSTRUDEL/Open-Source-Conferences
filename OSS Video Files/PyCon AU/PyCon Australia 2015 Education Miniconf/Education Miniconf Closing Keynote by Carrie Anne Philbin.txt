	00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,020
hi so as you may have just heard from my

00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:21,910
microphone test I flew over from England

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,710
flew in yesterday morning so right now

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,469
I'm feeling very jet-lagged so I

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,079
apologize if I rush or any of this or

00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm not very clear do just come and ask

00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,259
me any questions I'm happy to talk about

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,460
this and I'm here today and I'm here

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,570
tomorrow tomorrow i'll be giving the

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,270
keynote and i need to be really careful

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,559
well i don't accidentally start moving

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,670
into that area of what i want to talk

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
about some more in the key no because it

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,600
would be quite different 2 i'm going to

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,910
talk about today so my name is carrie

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,079
Ann I work full-time for the raspberry

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,550
pi foundation I used to be a teacher and

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm also an author i've written book and

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,329
i have a youtube channel as well and so

00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,070
if you want to contact me at any time

00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:00,040
twitter is always the best way to get me

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,360
and my twitter handle is there and like

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,559
i said i've written a book and once

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,110
you've written a book you like

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,970
contractually obliged at any time we are

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,200
giving a talk to mention the fact that

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,460
you wrote a book so this is me

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,990
mentioning that I've written the book

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,880
and this is what the book is so this is

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,440
the book that I wrote this one time and

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,690
it's just one book right so this is

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,220
proof I was a teacher right these are

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,729
these are the only two photographs I

00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,130
have of me actually teaching and here

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,530
are some children lovingly looking up to

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,390
me as i impart wisdom upon them and as

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,549
teachers you will know this never

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,549
happens and this is clearly a staged

00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:35,409
photograph me pointing at screens and

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:37,210
things this isn't staged photograph

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,610
though this is me actually teaching

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,460
pointing at things again what teachers

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,900
do and my students here asking some

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,430
questions and some of you might notice

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,470
that there are some raspberry PI's on

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,740
the table in this picture which I'll

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,299
come back to in a bit so my philosophy

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,310
on computer science and teaching

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,890
computer science is this the computer

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,200
science is for everyone I repeat that

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,360
computer science is for everyone whether

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,860
you're a girl a boy whether you come

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,979
from a really poor working-class

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,240
background or you have lots of money

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,759
whatever your ethnicity whatever your

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,250
disability or your special educational

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,480
need right none of this matters computer

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,159
science is for everybody

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,659
and something that's obviously very

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,150
close to my heart is about getting women

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,980
and girls into computer science which is

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,739
why I have a youtube channel around this

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,440
and there was a report recently in the

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,959
UK that sounds sixteen percent of IT

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,760
professionals were women for sixteen

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,140
percent in the UK doesn't get much

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,940
better in the states we're talking about

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,650
twenty percent and these figures are

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,269
kind of standard around the world I'm

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,970
really what that means and let's not

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,410
just focus on on women in tech and

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,000
there's also a problem here with

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,349
children from poor economic backgrounds

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,360
as well they're not particularly well

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,220
represented in the tech industry and

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,989
what this means is the people who are

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,120
consuming technology at the moment are

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,549
not the people creating technology and

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,870
that's a problem right really that's a

00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:59,790
problem how do you how do you know your

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,629
your market needs if they're not the

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,370
people creating technology so um if

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,680
you're aware of what's happened or has

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,180
happened over it in England in the last

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
few years let me just give you a bit of

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,010
a brief recap okay so we have this thing

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,349
called a computing curriculum now in

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,780
2011 well actually 2010 eric schmidt

00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:24,269
from google stood up and basically just

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,609
slammed and the teaching of IT in

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,650
england just completely just rubbished

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,120
it and like like one talk about how

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,919
terrible it was we were basically

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,019
teaching children how to be consumers of

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,880
technology how we were really just

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,160
teaching Microsoft products to children

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,919
and how what this meant was for him to

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,230
employ programmers into Google was not

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,260
good because the skills were so weak and

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:50,280
then our at the time education secretary

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,290
in 2011 stood up our educational

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,540
technology show in England called bet

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,950
and he said well you know what we're

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,889
going to scrap the curriculum we go

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,079
teaching and then in 2014 we're going to

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,910
introduce a new one so he kind of just

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,489
left here that really which was

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,760
interesting and so a bunch of people got

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,069
together a lot of teachers academics

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,049
they got together they formed this kind

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,629
of community called computing at school

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,539
and in commuting at school is a

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,220
fantastic grassroots organization and

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,750
really it was this kind of movement of

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,969
teachers that change this and brought

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,900
this curriculum Bell it wasn't just Eric

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:26,190
Schmidt standing up

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,590
making this announcement it was also

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,930
coming from teachers teachers like me

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,400
who were in the classroom he were doing

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,139
a good job we weren't rubbish teachers

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,430
we weren't just pushing Microsoft

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,870
products you know we would try and get

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,550
through what that curriculum was very

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,259
quickly in order to try and teach

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,370
something that we wanted to teach so I

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,780
was teaching programming already so we

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,250
have this new curriculum now and this

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,660
kind of just is a bit of a summary of

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,600
what that curriculum is about me I

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,539
normally uses an example and so from the

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,240
age of five in England children will

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,889
learn to code and program and they have

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,039
to understand algorithms sequencing

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,419
selection and repetition okay and and

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,840
what this means is we are not teaching

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,970
five-year-olds you know assembler right

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,800
it's not what we're doing here what

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,630
would you know this line can be achieved

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,030
without going anywhere near a computer

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,639
we can do things with unplugged

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,800
activities with cards with directions

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,380
and so on right so this is not that

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,180
scary but then from the age of 11 which

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,190
is our high school our secondary aged

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,370
children need to use at least two

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,260
programming languages one can be visual

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,750
right so that could be scratched but the

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,370
other one has to be text-based right so

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,470
this means that from the age of 11

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,090
upwards they must be using a text based

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,510
programming language which is good news

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,860
Python right which I'll come back to so

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,590
they need to be able to solve

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,720
computational problems they think about

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,340
real-world problems and build physical

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,949
systems and we've had a lot of talks

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,960
today here in this mini conference which

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,699
I think would help teachers in the UK so

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,120
I think you guys are doing a really good

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,039
job but the bad news around this

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,050
curriculum is of course our government

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,830
said well we're bringing this in but you

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,400
know what we're not going to give you

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,500
any money you're on your own so what

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,659
they did was they invested 3.5 million

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,130
in the upscale retraining of teachers

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,500
which sounds like a lot of money

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,720
actually if you break it down this 176

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,330
pounds per school and that doesn't

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,310
release a teacher for one day let alone

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,919
for them to go on a course and pay for a

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,180
course over a period of time it's just

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,640
not going to happen so there's no money

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,470
in this what's where

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,200
so in the meantime around this time a

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:37,140
group of guys in Cambridge at Cambridge

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,000
University got together and they that

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,830
started in 2007 so they're already ahead

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,420
of the game they noticed that their

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,620
intake of students into computer science

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,510
at Cambridge is one of the best

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,030
universities in the world for computer

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,070
science and the skills were getting

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,570
weaker and weaker like they only have 80

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,070
places on their computer science course

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,780
and they were finding they won't work

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,610
getting like even 100 people applying

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,520
for the places because they just didn't

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,020
have the skills so they got together and

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,070
they thoughts about what could they do

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,170
to change this and they thought about

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,610
when they were younger right so I was

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,010
born in the 80s so when I was younger I

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,200
had this amazing device called a BBC

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,560
micro my school at home we had things

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:18,150
like ZX Spectrum Commodore 64 all of

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,430
these devices you needed to use text to

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,430
interact with them and that was really a

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,470
starting point and you had to sort try

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,910
and fail almost and so that's where a

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,010
lot of people's passion for programming

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,720
started and children today they just

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,820
don't have those kinds of devices they

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
don't have BBC micros they have tablets

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,430
and they have xboxes and there's a big

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,860
leap from being able to program that to

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,180
do something such as playing with it so

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,050
they're consuming these devices that

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,800
when they're not able to do anything

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,240
with them and so these guys they got

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,860
together one of which is eben Upton

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,530
who's a name some of you might recognize

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,190
and they created this device called a

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,870
Raspberry Pi i have two over here and

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,340
the idea around Raspberry Pi is that

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,980
it's a $35 computer u.s. dollars which

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,480
puts in the hands of children everywhere

00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,950
it was always intended to be something

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,860
to be used at home that you could plug

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,900
into your TV you just repurpose a USB

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,900
keyboard and mouse and off you go and it

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,850
was yours and the software runs off an

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,070
SD card so if you corrupt the file

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,360
system by breaking it because you're

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,430
packing it or you're doing something

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,870
with it doesn't matter right you could

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,220
just wipe it and start again it's not

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,630
like you've taken the family's only

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,160
laptop which has all the family

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,729
photographs on it and you've messed

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,440
around with it and broken it

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,029
this is a really safe environment for

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,940
children to just mess around with and

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,099
tinker and play with I learn through

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,620
play and that's been lost really for

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:43,810
children so a lot of people don't

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,190
realize that I speak at conferences all

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,959
the time was at your own Python last

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,160
week and I had a whole bunch of

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,019
conversations with developers around

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,820
Wells beep I and the whole time they

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,850
were talking to me like I was we were an

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,769
ed tech startup but we were at this tech

00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,279
organization we're not at all the

00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,930
foundation where a charity we just have

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,730
this really interesting model women in

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,920
the way in which was funded in that we

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,079
produce this single board computer and

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,839
the tiny amount of profit we make on

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,220
that one hundred percent of it is pumped

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,170
back into the foundation so we're able

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,790
to meet this mission which is to advance

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,680
the education of adults and children in

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,320
the field of computers computer science

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,240
and related subjects so we don't just

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,300
stop at computer science we're talking

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,190
about digital making art engineering

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,500
sciences all of these subjects are

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,199
important to us and we think computing

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,410
underpins all of those so what do we do

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:37,389
the foundation well we write free

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,800
resources and I don't just mean free as

00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:40,540
in you don't have to pay for them I mean

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,399
free in terms of the license that we use

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,589
they are creative commons share alike so

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
the same licenses Wikipedia we have for

00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,209
lesson plans schemes of work for

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,350
teachers we have tutorials for people

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,990
who just want to kind of learn by

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,180
themselves and we have make like digital

00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,699
making style projects and we also

00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,589
provide free training for teachers which

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,510
is Nick mentioned Pike Adam E which I'll

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,209
talk about in a bit like I said the

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,250
government gave us no money no money to

00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,690
train teachers so when I joined the

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,040
foundation it was one of the first

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,779
things I thought about was like well how

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,510
can we help teachers with this new

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,339
curriculum how can we train them and we

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,600
also run a whole bunch of national and

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,480
international competitions which I'll

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,209
show you too so here's some examples or

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,920
our resources we have like a classroom

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,779
guide for teachers who perhaps don't

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,790
know how to plug a raspberry pi into

00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,769
their existing equipment we find

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,750
sometimes monitors can be a problem and

00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,190
especially if you've got vga monitors

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,829
usually equipment in schools is quite

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,730
old and outdated rather play uses hdmi

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,709
which is quite new so

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,139
we try and find some solutions around

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,790
that which is all in our guide we have

00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,370
like lesson plans about getting started

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,779
in raspberry pi you heard mention a few

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,120
times today think people have talked

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,970
about minecraft pie so we have a version

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,399
of Minecraft which you can program with

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,870
Python which is a really we find is a

00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,389
really good hook for children to get

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,949
them into text based programming and

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:03,050
when we have projects like the push

00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:05,060
button stop motion which do with

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,970
physical computing so the Raspberry Pi

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,220
has GPIO pins on it these are

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,449
general-purpose input/output pins which

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,430
means you're able to connect them to

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,690
physical real-world objects and program

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,100
them and make things happen which I'm

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,360
hopefully going to show you later on as

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,740
well so why academy we've run a lot of

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,850
Pike Adam ease this numbers a bit out of

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:28,190
date now but in april 2014 we launched

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,110
this teacher training course everything

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,810
it riles reply needs to be a pun in some

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,490
way so it was the Raspberry Pi Academy

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,570
for teachers and one day one of my

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,399
colleagues just turn around and went

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,589
there Pike Adam II and the name just

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,240
kind of stuck so we've run a whole bunch

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:44,510
and I think we're after 11 pike Adam

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,560
eads we've run now so we've trained and

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,300
certified over 200 teachers now and the

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
feedback we get from people who come on

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,389
the two day course has been really

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,709
really positive obviously it's really

00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:56,839
easy to just kind of make up statistics

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,399
but really I go through the feedback

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,949
forms really thoroughly I really make

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,750
sure everyone feels mouth even I was

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:05,029
surprised by the statistics that nice

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,680
7.5 percent stated they were now likely

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,420
or very likely to use Ryles reply in

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,399
their classroom but that's not the focus

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,290
of what we do it's not about like

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,110
pushing the product it's about showing

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,970
what's possible with technology and the

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,920
more impressive figure for me and the

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,110
one that's more important is the 98.8

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,940
sin who stated they were now likely or

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,220
very likely to share their training with

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,050
other teachers right we're training the

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,579
trainers essentially because we're such

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,459
a small team of the foundation there's

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,740
like five or six of us we trained 24

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,389
teachers at a time we ask that they they

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,070
become last week I certified educators

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,930
and we also go and train other people

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,880
and so this is what Roger pride

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,250
certified educators are expected to do

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,290
we hope they have a positive positive

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,120
impact on their local community so that

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,440
could be at school maybe they'll train

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,060
other teachers in their school maybe

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,430
they'll train teachers from other

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,200
schools maybe they'll train parents

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,400
right or maybe they'll start after

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,410
school club maybe they'll start

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,600
something called a raspberry jam which

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,010
is where people get together kind of

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,810
like this and they have like

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,320
show-and-tell and they run workshops in

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:09,450
the community we have a forum and a

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,610
Google+ group that they get involved

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,980
with may help answer questions and we

00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,300
also ask them to contribute like lesson

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,190
plans to us so if they've done something

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,750
in their classroom quite often they'll

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,330
share that with us and we're able to put

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,920
it on our website this is what they look

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,860
like as you can see they have a lot of

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,390
fun when they come to us is Evan Upton

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,490
lying on the floor in this particular

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,830
glamour shot we have just so many

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,560
pictures like this and the last one down

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,030
here it says sony we took for the first

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,920
time we took like a de me on the road

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,990
just rather late doing in our offices in

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,100
cambridge we went to wales which is

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,900
where our raspberry PI's are

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,820
manufactured in the UK we're really

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,650
proud the razmik we were able to bring

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,800
manufacturing of raspberry PI's to the

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,720
UK so they weren't manufactured in China

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,040
and so Sony have a plant down in Wales

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,570
and we were able to go there we had a

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,720
tour around so we all got to see them

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,880
being made which was a lot of fun so

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,140
where are they all well here's a map of

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,070
England but that doesn't really do it

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:08,190
justice so what I'm going to try and do

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,630
you show you where they are so there's

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,020
on the massive cluster in England

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,600
obviously I can't see is I'm probably

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,150
to zoom out that's pretty much it at the

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,760
moment we do get people who come from

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,980
around the world who make the journey

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,950
they fly all the way to Cambridge just

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,540
to be part of what we're trying to do

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,220
the question I get all the time whenever

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,650
we talk about Pike Adam ease when are

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,780
you bringing it to insert name of city

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,430
around the world here right like when

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,630
are you coming to altamonte golia to do

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,030
PI Academy when are you coming to

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,430
Australia when you come into you know

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,740
Algeria when are you coming the question

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,230
I get most often and unfortunately we

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,300
are a very small group of people like i

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,830
said this five or six of us what you

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,170
know our challenge right now is how do

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,520
we get this training to people across

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,830
the other side of the world like how can

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,990
we help train Australian teachers from

00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,370
the UK right that's our problem that we

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,070
need to solve when we're working on that

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,720
but it's unlikely that we would fly all

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,610
the way out here just to run just to

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,380
train 24 teachers right that's not

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,790
economically viable for us and it's

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,740
probably not good solution for you guys

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,510
either so it's something we need to

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,490
think about and what a promise we're

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,250
working on it so that's where they all

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,410
are and and the other thing we have for

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,870
our certified teachers we have this

00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,370
closed google+ group so once they become

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,040
certified we invite them to this group

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,900
and this is where they share like their

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,100
lesson plan ideas or they ask questions

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,780
of each other in a really safe

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,670
environment so they don't feel

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,760
threatened because we find with teachers

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,890
with forums like open forums that

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,330
sometimes quite scared to ask questions

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,660
because they can be kind of shot down

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,520
very easily by people i think if you are

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,260
developer in the room and you know you

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,450
want to help teachers think you need

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,370
really need to be careful with that that

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,410
you kind of think about how you talk to

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,510
them and how you bring them in and how

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,700
you support them so here you can see

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,730
some examples of you know what people

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,860
have done

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,990
this here is a space flight we did a

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,029
revert with a raspberry pi recently we

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,399
were testing just to make sure it worked

00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:10,100
we sent a Raspberry Pi up with a camera

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,290
on it just with a helium balloon from

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,930
Cambridge we do the launch and these are

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,850
the photographs it took on that day and

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,589
basically the helium balloon grows large

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,670
and then bursts when it gets the kind of

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:24,529
almost space and then the rosslyn pyar

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,300
drops back down it's got GPS tracker on

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:27,680
it so we can chase it and find it so

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,850
you're able to retrieve the photographs

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,190
and the reason why I mentioned this is

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,660
because we're actually running our first

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,790
skycaddie me yes everything's a pun

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,149
we're running a sky Academy so we have

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,889
teachers from around the UK coming to

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:43,040
learn how they can do a space flight in

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:44,959
their area and so this is very specific

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,310
to the UK this particular course because

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,130
the regulations are different in

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,570
different countries so we're going to do

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,980
this one and see how it goes but we're

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,050
quite excited that's happening end of

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,240
august so you're able to watch the live

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,190
flight and the data that's happening

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,899
there's lots of data that it's sending

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,570
down as well as pictures which is kind

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,040
of cool yeah so some of them go off and

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,589
they run their own coding evening so

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,500
this is cat laman she's primary teacher

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,850
so she came to us and was so

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,140
enthusiastic about what we were trying

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,939
to do she wanted to share it with other

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,650
people she went back to where she's from

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,880
in West London and she tried to find

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,380
some groups who were doing stuff she

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,600
couldn't find anything so she thought

00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,520
well just start my own and it's now

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,919
become so successful that other cities

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,839
around the UK and want to run these cody

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,700
evening so she's helping them which is

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,700
pretty cool Erin privates

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,799
this is really hard what my things

00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:41,350
so that's our community and something

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,059
else we do and this is really really

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,529
close to my heart right now is that

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,610
there's a whole so we got this new

00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,889
curriculum we're going to train all

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,539
these children they're saved all the

00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,340
ones who are kind of 30-plus they're all

00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,600
right because we had BBC micros and

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,190
stuff and we had programming in our

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,379
curriculum when we were younger versus

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,850
gap in the middle there are children who

00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,710
are leaving school now who don't have

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,149
the skills or have left school in the

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,070
last five or ten years who now just

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,500
don't have the skills that industry

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:09,100
require so something that we're trying

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,759
to do is address that So Rachel rains

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:15,309
who's our creative producer Raspberry Pi

00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,379
she was out artist in residence and she

00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,600
started this program called the rods

00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:21,730
replied creative technologists and so

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,679
it's it's a free 12 month training

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,039
program for young people aged between 16

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,720
and 21 who you know perhaps haven't gone

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,299
to universe II don't have schools don't

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,149
have a job but who are interested in

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,169
this space and so we're working with the

00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,080
partners that you can see along the

00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,909
bottom like the VNA and the National

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,190
Writers Center in Norwich and feature

00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:44,559
everything join so we give them a mentor

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,909
and over 12 12 months they kind of

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,049
develop a portfolio of what they're

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,110
doing they're able to go off and

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:52,330
hopefully get gainful employment and one

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,750
of them in fact because we've been

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,700
running this now since it's April one of

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,809
them he managed to start a conversation

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:04,149
with the principle of ravensbourne which

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,659
is a kind of college university in

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:09,850
London which is around like design

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:11,529
technology digital making kind of in

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,120
this space and it's quite a prestigious

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:16,179
place you're going to a conversation

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,510
with a managed to convince them to allow

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,580
him to

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,110
to join a course and they've let him so

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,880
he's now going to university where we're

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,890
really proud that that's happened why we

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,170
gave him the encouragement and the

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,270
enthusiasm and the confidence to be able

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,280
to go out and show people what he had

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,570
done with us and now he's going to

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,250
university which before he couldn't

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,080
access because he didn't have you know

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,640
perhaps the grades and he didn't have

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,040
the portfolio or the evidence to show

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,150
that he could do stuff so this is

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,650
something that's really close to my

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,270
heart something we need to be really

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,150
careful about as we move forward with a

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,250
new curriculum so what else do we do I'm

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,750
really excited about space this morning

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:56,180
you had written in your slides right and

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,680
i quickly tweeted this to my colleagues

00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,960
in the UK who are asleep but they're

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,270
awake now so they've seen it because we

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,560
say this all the time because birds

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,150
we're really excited because to

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,590
raspberry PI's are going up to the

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,680
International Space Station at the end

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:13,040
of this year so British ISA astronaut

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,290
Tim Peake is going up and as part of his

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,640
mission the pies are going with him and

00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,910
we've been running a competition in the

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,800
UK for children to write code and those

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,720
programs he's going to run them in space

00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,730
aboard the International Space Station

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,140
and if he finds any problems with their

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,580
code he's going to phone them up from

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,100
the International Space Station and say

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,560
hey your program has stopped working on

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,920
line 12 do you want to help me live

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,210
debug this I am in space by the way

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,290
which i think is really exciting and

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,260
some of the projects have been really

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,390
really fun some of them are based around

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,710
data logging so he's going to be doing

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,570
some data logging up on the space

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,070
station and the children on the ground

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,140
we doing similar experiments and

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,720
comparing like live comparing the data

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,760
which is which is fun and so we have a

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,890
special board that fits on top of

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,750
Raspberry Pi it's called the center or

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,550
the asteroid pie hat and y1 is here over

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,100
the moment you can see it's gone LED

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,810
matrix it's got joystick it's packed

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,940
full of sensors so it has a temperature

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:13,520
sensor it has accelerometer it's just

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,370
full of sensors so and we're going to

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,930
put them on sale hopefully we hope this

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,040
is going to

00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,330
and in the next few months and they're

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,490
going to cost thirty-five dollars as

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,810
well so it's full of sensors and the

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,850
children would be able to use in school

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,980
science projects for you know whole

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,570
bunch of things and so do have a look

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,250
the asteroid pie website and we're

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,160
continually writing resources around

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,620
this and and those rather pies are going

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,000
to stay up there so this isn't the end I

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,980
want once are up there they're up there

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,600
for good we spent a lot of time testing

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,040
whereas replies in all sorts of

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,050
situations because to get something a

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,240
wallaby ISS you have to make sure it's

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,700
like super super safe like forget like

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,140
FCC regulations and see regulations

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,610
there nothing you will thank in space

00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,260
going to make sure it's not going to

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,690
hurt an astronaut and you have to like

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,610
blow it up and stuff so yeah they're

00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,350
staying up there and our hope is the

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,610
other astronauts will it from other

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,560
countries are going to start using them

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,330
in a similar way so we're looking to see

00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,900
that this competition runs in other

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:10,150
European countries through ISA and NASA

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,130
are interested in this as well so you

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,180
know you guys have astronauts too so

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,770
this could be such a way of just

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,900
engaging our children in a different way

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,180
so it's something else we do is called

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,580
sonic PI you might not have heard of

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:25,270
sonic PI but we work with a guy a

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,370
researcher at the University of

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,980
Cambridge called dr. Sam Aaron who is a

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,540
live coder of music I met him back in

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,370
twenty twelve when I first started

00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,620
working with raspberry PI's go back to

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,120
my pictures right the start of this he

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,650
came to my classroom with the Raspberry

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,320
Pi and said could we teach children how

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,030
to program using music and I just sort

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,330
of such a great idea that we should give

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,740
it a go so we created sonic PI and we

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,870
have a competition around that we run

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,390
every year like I said we're a bit space

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,400
mad so you can see here that the one we

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,130
ran last year was a kind of space themed

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,980
music competition and I can just give

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,200
you a quick glance at sonic when she

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,520
says

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,020
okay so this is sonic PI always always a

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,940
bit worrying to do this because it's

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,610
Ruby always wearing a Python conference

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,440
to show people Ruby but I do it anyway

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:19,390
because that's one like and so the

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,570
really cool thing about about sonic PI

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,740
is its text based programming right just

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,130
pretend it's not really for a moment

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,290
it's text based programming and but what

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,550
it does is it produces sound so a lot of

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,960
people today we're talking in their

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,000
presentations about how do we move

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,650
children from scratch to text based

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,030
programming language how do we make that

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,260
transition because actually a lot of

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,640
children don't want to move away from

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,130
what they're comfortable with which is

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,410
scratch right they like that immediate

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,750
feedback of something right and i would

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,090
thoroughly recommend sounds because very

00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,070
quickly young people couldn't start

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,500
making music with really simple syntax

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,910
like this just play 16 it'll play a note

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,210
now what i'm going to do is turn this

00:23:54,910 --> 00:24:01,240
off in my laptop which hopefully you

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,330
will be able to what just been out to

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,890
hear about right so it's simple just

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,290
plays a note and then we can introduce

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:14,470
you know like pause is and i can play

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:18,550
like a different note right like sounds

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:22,540
pretty weak at the moment however if i

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:26,400
can't find my mouth you are able to do

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,400
very complicate things

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:45,600
enough nightclub mode so yeah but

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,520
something quite you can actually make

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,380
some pretty amazing sounding music with

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,550
this and what we found in England is

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,130
that there are people who are teaching

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,270
the music curriculum using sonic PI so

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,740
this is where you can see computer

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,070
science can underpin a whole bunch of

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,170
other subjects not just you know not

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,970
just in computing lessons and something

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,590
else that's really cool about sonic PI

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,150
is to do with the interface and it's

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,720
something that i will talk quite heavily

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,820
about tomorrow in my keynote and so this

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,960
is ruby pretend it's not Ruby for a

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,400
moment it is it is really so there's no

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,170
indentation someone just said where are

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,740
the indents because in Python

00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:24,720
indentation is really important and in

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,880
Ruby it's not right but it is important

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,730
to teach children about indentation I

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,290
would you know I really believe that so

00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,820
this is why it's quite nice to use sonic

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,830
PI with children to move them from

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,570
visual to text base because they don't

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,740
require indentation so they don't fall

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,390
down here however um one thing you have

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,640
to do in Ruby's you have to put

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,140
everything you want inside a block

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,640
between are doing an end and here you

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,470
can see this plant like two ends and

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,360
after a while children will just write

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,840
loads and loads of code as a teacher

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,520
comes really difficult to kind of debug

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,010
children's code when you're looking at

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,380
tons of stuff that's not indented but

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,100
the cool thing about sonic PI is if I

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,730
can for my mouth

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:11,210
is this button here that says a line it

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,890
just automatically aligns the code which

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,450
is really nice and it's really easy then

00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,010
to spot where the problems are and I

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,960
would really recommend if anyone's

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,049
thinking about creating this I love as

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,340
well oh my god in idle to make the font

00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,960
size bigger or a small light you hat

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,630
it's like three mouse clicks or

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,340
something ridiculous like please people

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,830
who make my PyCharm was talked about a

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,510
lot today if Jett rains are watching

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,860
this please just make some buttons that

00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,450
makes the text smaller and bigger bike

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,210
so I can show the kids won't do on the

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,380
screen yes that's not acquire for we

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,720
talked about Ruby a little bit too much

00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,360
there but if you're interested in

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,919
finding out more about that free scheme

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,179
to work on it on our website I always

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,880
found it as a really good transition

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,789
between scratch and then Python right

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,080
because the same concept as they move

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,960
through and actually things where they

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,429
fall down is with names you know you

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,770
mentioned earlier on about which I found

00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,809
really interesting about the words that

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,400
we use that's where children fall down

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:06,710
and actually sonic pies and ice in

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,020
between so what else have we got weather

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:12,010
station so Oracle gave us a whole bunch

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,929
money to develop a weather station

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:18,350
around the Raspberry Pi and so what

00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:20,270
we've done is we're giving away think

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:24,080
it's about a thousand weather station

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,549
kits globally to schools and the idea

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,230
being that they will set up these

00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:30,530
weather stations and then they will

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:33,230
transmit their data into an Oracle

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,580
database and that data will become open

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,620
data so that other people will be able

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,020
to use that where the data it's around

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,360
the world and so we've now closed and

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,070
this because we had so many people apply

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,929
we're in the process of the moment

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,850
selecting people I was talking to a

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,169
teacher earlier on today she was asking

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,169
me about it because she signed up for

00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:52,820
this so you know some of these could be

00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,039
in Australia which is exciting for us

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,020
and if it goes well you know maybe we'll

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,640
be able to produce these and sell them

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:03,270
as well so schools can start using them

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,100
but didn't have a look at that and we

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,340
have an in-house magazine called the

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,320
magpie it's a free electronic magazine

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,340
that you just head to our website you

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,640
could download copy it's full of

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,770
tutorials full of articles as of

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,050
yesterday it went on sale for the first

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,000
time in in the UK that you can actually

00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,470
buy a physical copy and I'm really

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,440
gutted but I'm not there to be able to

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,630
hold one and and it was an originally

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
created by our community for community

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,500
and so don't have a look at the magpie

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,480
it's pretty cool and we do other things

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,220
like we we partner with other

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,660
organizations like the University of

00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,390
Cambridge so that maybe they've got some

00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,370
interns and they've had they had

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,020
different interns last year working on

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,660
the same project so this is project pile

00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,840
and so again this is trying to focus on

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,520
this idea of moving children from visual

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,470
programming to text based programming

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,080
and so the idea here is that they've

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,340
created again and the way you interact

00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,470
with that game where you solve the

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,510
puzzles is you use Python programming to

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,950
be able to do it so if that's something

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,630
you're interested in follow them on

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,240
Twitter they're doing a really great job

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,770
euro Python last week and there was a

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,090
lightning talk about this so all those

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,260
talks are online so you'd be able to

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,390
watch that and find out more information

00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,270
about this project but this what works

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,340
beautifully on a Raspberry Pi which is

00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,110
great someone was talking about

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,670
Minecraft payaliya they stay up here and

00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:25,500
said you have to use Python 2 i'm wrong

00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,450
python 3 and this is the first

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,310
conference I've been to for a long time

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,850
where there's been a lot of talk about

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,920
Python 2 i'm not finding this in europe

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,960
at all everyone is moving towards place

00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,640
and three so there was a time when all

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,350
the dependent packages you know that you

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,290
needed to run a lot of the stuff on Lars

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,480
reply were in Python to only but that's

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:49,110
not the case anymore and personally I

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,570
can't see a reason why in education why

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,640
you would be using Python to like it I

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,210
don't really see why that would be the

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,830
case and so I recommend Python 3 so at

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,080
minecraft I what you can do it's a

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,480
version of Minecraft you can use Python

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,240
or Java than a wide you java

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,940
and so you can manipulate things to

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,770
happen in Minecraft right so this blows

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,270
children's minds and I have a video to

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,430
show you hopefully okay so I'm going to

00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:22,530
kind of talk over this video a little

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:25,910
bit so why build a house right when you

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:31,590
can program program one to just appear

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:33,960
it will okay boom right and that in

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,820
itself just blows children's minds right

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,050
because I'm spend hours building houses

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,610
in Minecraft and when you show them you

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,140
can build one of course once you've got

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,460
one house what you're able to do is with

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,250
the iteration you can just build a whole

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,880
town right boom there you go a whole

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,430
bunch of houses and but that's not the

00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,950
best house right the best house in

00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:56,310
Minecraft will be the one you'll see in

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,020
a minute and children when they see this

00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,210
you'd be really surprised like Minecraft

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,770
is everywhere at the moment and and this

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,000
kind of really blows their mind and they

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,290
were able to start but this is the best

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,810
house in Minecraft and the reason being

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:10,500
who doesn't matter where in Minecraft

00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:12,570
you go you turn around its behind you I

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,730
wish I could take credit for that but I

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,500
can't this is all the work of an amazing

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,490
man called Martin O'Hanlon and he's

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,740
written a book about this good

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,660
adventures in Minecraft he has a website

00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,030
called stuff about code as if you'll

00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,520
know anything about Minecraft pi go and

00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,790
see his work it's amazing he managed to

00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:32,490
recreate the whole intro of the battle

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,440
in Star Wars a new hope completely in

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,900
Minecraft using code that's the kind of

00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,850
guy he is he's a huge fan of his I work

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,650
and you can do stuff like this as well

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,060
you know you can make moving objects

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,330
like this because it's all about just

00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:48,230
creating your block taking a block away

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:54,580
adding a book so minecraft is yeah good

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:54,580
fun so i definitely recommend minecraft

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,780
marc-andré hamelin on Twitter and stuff

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,490
about codices website if you guys go to

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,950
our website riles reply to all we have

00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,140
tutorials and how to use it as well and

00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:11,990
I know Katie last year at PyCon UK gave

00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,000
an amazing talk about pumpkins in

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,420
Minecraft and dropping them on chickens

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,570
true story so if you're interested in

00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,440
any of these things right how we can try

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,120
and get this information out to

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,330
educators and people around the world is

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,680
we have an education newsletter I I send

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,890
it out once a month it's like a

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,080
mailchimp kind of electronic newsletter

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,150
and it will be full of this kind of

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,910
stuff what we're doing at the moment how

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,950
you can get involved I try and send one

00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,330
out one a month but that's it I haven't

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,980
done this month because I'm just like

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,350
back to back conferences at the moment

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,090
but this is how you can the best way you

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,680
can find out information about what

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,840
we're doing like I say pretty much

00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,840
everything we do is for free right we're

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,850
charity all we care about is enabling

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,080
teachers enabling volunteers who work

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:02,570
with children and to empower them so my

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,770
raspberry pi in the classroom I get I

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,180
used to ask this question all the time

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,040
it was one of the first teachers to use

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,740
them in my classroom there's a whole

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,390
bunch of reasons which makes sense the

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,940
first one is that it is a classroom

00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,790
solution so in my classroom I was in a

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,040
windows environment all of the stations

00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,080
were lockdown you can execute any code

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,460
couldn't install anything on it if I

00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,650
wanted to install something that I've go

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,470
beg the network technicians that almond

00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,900
are about it for a few months and I just

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,160
can't work like that and and so for me

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,180
it was like well actually here's

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,970
something I can just take him to the

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,190
classroom and it's not networked it's

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,480
fine and if the kids break the SD cards

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,520
doesn't matter i could swipe them to

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,060
give them new ones and so for me it was

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,740
a real classroom solution

00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:49,050
to that problem well you can control

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,570
real-world objects so as I mentioned the

00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,400
Raspberry Pi has these pins it means you

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,470
can add on boards like this hat over

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,720
here and I can control the LED matrix

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,430
but also you can attach electronic

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,030
components and start programming things

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:05,190
to happen in states i saw a presentation

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,390
by a teacher who was talking about like

00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,650
Internet of Things stuff he was doing

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,850
with these children's they were using

00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,190
iPads but they were controlling

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,650
raspberry PI's turn on and off lights

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:17,010
which switches and create automatic

00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:21,720
doors and so on and it's really so

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,670
project-based learning is a good one so

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,260
this idea that you can build into a

00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,360
project to make something quite big I

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,740
think that's what makes it exciting and

00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,030
it's cheap yep so cheap right I'm in the

00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,820
UK we have this thing called pupil

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,470
premium so that's any child that has

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,110
claimed free school meals in the past

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:42,240
six years right so they may have claimed

00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,950
it five years ago not be having their

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,000
not having free school meals now there

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:46,050
doesn't mean they're out of poverty

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,640
right just because they're no longer

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,160
claiming free school meals and we have

00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,050
this kind of six year thing and what it

00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,760
means is the government gives schools

00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,860
money depending on how many people

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,540
premium children you have so if I'm in a

00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,070
school in the deprived area I'm gonna

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,710
have a lot of children on free school

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,390
meals that means we have more money but

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:06,240
I can only spend that money on those

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:08,430
children what so I might want to use

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,810
that money to take a trip for its kids

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,820
i'm going to take into the national

00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,350
computing museum right but i can only

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,140
take the children who are pupil premium

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:19,110
with that money right so if i've got two

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,850
groups of friends and one people premium

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,620
one isn't one who isn't can't come on

00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,260
the school trip that's not fair and it's

00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,480
also singling out the kids who are

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,980
disadvantaged so what we're finding is a

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,870
lot of teachers are actually using that

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,850
money to buy raspberry PI's for those

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,650
children so they can then take them home

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,900
and they have a device at home they can

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,850
use my only to program with but they can

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,349
connect it to the internet that opens up

00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,150
a whole world for them

00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,880
and they're able to install things like

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,499
Libre Office on raspberry pi 2 and use

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,970
it so they actually they have something

00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,589
that's their own because you will find

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,269
that children from you know

00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:52,920
disadvantaged backgrounds do not have

00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:54,839
their own laptop they do not have their

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,369
own tablet their own smartphone right

00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,499
not every child has access to the

00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:00,410
Internet multiply is a really nice

00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:02,759
solution for those children and

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,880
obviously we have free training and free

00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:07,829
resources so that's why we hope people

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,150
will come to us and the last one is the

00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:11,099
most important and I think it's really

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,529
ties into place them as well is about

00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,390
community raz your pie has the most

00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:17,430
amazing community of people around it

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,930
who just want to help teachers get

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,529
started and I find the Python community

00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:25,349
is very very similar right we just want

00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:26,579
to help how can we help you teachers how

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,650
can we help students how can we help

00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,049
parents how can we get children into

00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:35,999
this kind of mindset how can we change

00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:37,349
their lives so um something about Roger

00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:41,249
planets very exciting as a physical

00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:43,380
computing as I mentioned and so this is

00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,849
one of the kind of spaces in which I

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,069
think children get quite excited I

00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:50,190
always tell this story about turning on

00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:52,319
and off an LED one LED turning it on

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,599
with some code and turning it off with

00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,210
some code sounds really boring I'm yet

00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,460
to meet anyone who does this exercise

00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,499
who doesn't like jump around when it

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,140
happens you mentioned our moment we call

00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:07,440
it the moment it has arm actions goes

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,719
like this and I'm yet see anyone not be

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,009
really excited by this so I kind of call

00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:17,489
it hello world with LEDs right so um we

00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:21,150
have this amazing library called the are

00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:22,529
higher gpio library um I wish again we

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,079
could take credit for this but we can't

00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:27,119
and this again sums up how amazing the

00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,279
Python communities and there's a guy in

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,769
the UK called Ben croston he runs like a

00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,849
brewery he's own brewery and so he

00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:33,989
bought the Raspberry Pi initially

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,200
because he wanted to be able to control

00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:38,729
the temperature with pins he wants to

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,890
hook up some sensors and control them

00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:42,210
and there wasn't a Python library for it

00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,829
so he wrote one right that's very

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,789
typical to pi think amuse you just write

00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,229
one and because what happens is that

00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:51,089
everybody now starts using this library

00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:53,029
everyone in education is

00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:57,329
using this library to control the pins

00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:58,920
so with two lines I can you know really

00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:01,440
standard that's just input time and its

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,880
input library might need and the first

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,309
thing I need to do is I need to set up

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,499
the pins so in this line I'm just saying

00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:09,150
actually the the numbering system for

00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:11,309
the pins I want to use it's BCM which is

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,380
the broadcom pin numbering and there's

00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:15,390
another version called board we always

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,640
try and use the broadcom numbering where

00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,549
possible and then the next thing I need

00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:23,549
to do is just say so I want to use pin

00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:25,319
17 and I want to set it as an output

00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:28,019
right because I'm going to attach an LED

00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:30,900
to it so I said it as an output so

00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,969
that's all just set up right and now I

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,309
need to do is actually do some

00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:37,619
programming and so I'm going to do is

00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:39,869
I'm going to set that pin too high which

00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,579
is going to turn it on then I'm going to

00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:43,920
wait for a little once i'm going to wait

00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,869
for a couple of seconds and then i'm

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,680
going to set that pin too low on turn it

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:52,319
off that's it turn it on i'm going to

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,759
turn it off and it's my sticky tape will

00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:58,529
hold hopefully with my way glamorous

00:38:56,759 --> 00:39:02,700
assistant chip we're going to show you

00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:05,239
how that works time is going to go like

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,239
this

00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,359
Oh ever need to save okay right so came

00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,640
on and he went off right that's just

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,050
with one LED okay so now what do I want

00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:24,109
to do well actually I want to turn them

00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:28,680
both on I can do that so let's do that

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:30,240
yeah I f1 both off um so now I want to

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,140
do well actually I could put it inside a

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:41,250
loop right yeah let's get really excited

00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:43,109
let's do that one okay so let's just

00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,829
keep going right Teddy on turn it off

00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:51,319
turn it on turn it off forever but then

00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,319
you can do stuff with really cool LEDs

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:59,520
ok so these LEDs are ones that change

00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,119
color right so it gets even more

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,910
interesting right so kids they're pretty

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,520
cool right they they always bring their

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,690
creativity to the table a lot of people

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,510
have mentioned that when they've come up

00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,579
here to speak and I much a really firm

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,819
believer in not introducing context to

00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,260
children until they want them right when

00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,280
we were first thing sonic quiet one of

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,680
the things we did we introduced

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,970
variables in like less than three this

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,130
didn't mean anything she children like I

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,480
didn't need them so why are we teaching

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,130
them to them they didn't need them in

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,770
their music then why do they need to use

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,800
them and so I think it's the same with

00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,210
anything we do I only introduce concepts

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,849
when they're needed by the children so

00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:41,460
for the minecraft example we've made one

00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,869
house why want a whole town of them okay

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,960
well here's a concept that will help you

00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:48,390
it's a loop why this is iteration oh now

00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,250
I've got my town right just introduce

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,569
them when they're needed but that's

00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,520
physical computing for it's pretty

00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:56,550
straightforward and I'm actually quite a

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,230
lot of fun very easy so this is all the

00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,300
stuff that we do it's free educational

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,880
resources training for teacher software

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,470
my linux is the operating system we use

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,140
our version is called raspbian it's

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,089
based on debian free download our

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,230
community is free and they're amazing

00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,540
and we have all these pretty cool

00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,170
competitions and and what i want to

00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,859
leave you with

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:18,240
this when we were teaching this stuff to

00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:22,260
students in my school we were teaching

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,660
sleep I Sam Aaron and I my kids wrote

00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,849
him a card okay and this is one of the

00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,410
kids in the group her name is Ruth and

00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,210
she wrote to Sam and she wrote on the

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,930
card thank you for making dull life was

00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:35,910
computed interesting and almost reality

00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:38,400
like what the starting point for this

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,270
girl who's a very bright girl was that

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,190
computers a dull lifeless and boring

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,319
well like computers are the most amazing

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,940
things in the world right and we can

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,150
control them and make them do amazing

00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,920
things and that's pretty powerful and so

00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,869
let's just make sure that this doesn't

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,760
continue and actually we blow children's

00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,099
mind which with some LEDs and minecraft

00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,970
so my name is carrie Ann if you want to

00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,829
talk to me about any of this stuff

00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,260
please do tomorrow please come to my

00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:06,020
keynote I'm going to talk to you about

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,940
all the problems there are however

00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,790
Python in education about how we as a

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:22,980
community can answer those problems yeah

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:25,559
so thank you very much and for the folks

00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,230
that are just here for today like

00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,380
there's a few of you keriann's keynote

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:35,350
tomorrow will be recorded will be online

00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:39,040
so we'll have some time for questions

00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:41,500
with carrie Ann right now after that so

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,800
we're still at venue until five-thirty I

00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,320
think and so that's we hope use that

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,900
time we still have developers in the

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,550
room teachers in the room there's

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,180
projects your particular interested in

00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:57,280
getting help with or just some of the

00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,010
things that came up today that you'd

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,080
like to discuss further then that's

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,670
that's why we allocate at that time so

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,310
we will have a chance to discuss those

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,310
kind of things and now any questions

00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,350
so the key thing that you said there is

00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,300
curriculum an engagement of curriculum

00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,740
and the UK curriculum I mean you guys

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,040
are really lucky right and you've also

00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:24,280
got a beer so you've got huge I mean

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,410
where do we see a lucky extremely lucky

00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,760
pence who you are no no what you are

00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,200
very lucky right because you have

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,130
universities like Cambridge you have

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,230
these big universities you have the BSC

00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,640
you have a lot of drive there and that

00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,350
you've got that connection into

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,140
government that we don't have in

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,480
Australia and even in country for

00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,420
example the USA so I've done mentoring

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,980
with kids and worked across all the

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,940
three of the Western the key Western

00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,110
countries and they're very very

00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,720
different in regards to how that

00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,850
curriculum is engaged so with one laptop

00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,680
per child in Australia which is now one

00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,750
education the key thing for us was

00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,790
getting that into the curriculum now we

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,320
had to work with six state curriculums

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,700
to get that into the curriculum that's

00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,840
not just getting it at a federal level

00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,520
because we don't have a federal

00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,070
education can I just clarify that this

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,260
curriculum only applies to England it

00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,960
does not allow this Scotland Wales no I

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,550
realize this yet and that's what I'm

00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,430
thinking about is is within England

00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,230
itself and you know even the facilities

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:23,050
that you have a Cambridge I can't there

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:26,050
is not one University in Australia that

00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:28,480
has comparable there's a couple that

00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:33,550
have semi comparable but certainly not

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,930
as comparable they're comparable in

00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:38,710
regards to the amount of money that goes

00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:41,710
into research and development nit so I

00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,810
think that's that that is a that's been

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:45,640
a very very hard thing for us in

00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,200
Australia is actually getting that in so

00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,170
at the moment I've been part of a group

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,700
or a research group from funded by three

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,650
big universities and we've actually been

00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,860
designing the Australian qualifications

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,240
framework the first IT entrepreneurship

00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,910
certificate at that teeth but that's at

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,670
a safe level we still can't get that

00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,530
into schools and as I said the one

00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,690
laptop per child program really made

00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:11,830
that success because they were able to

00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:16,690
get some of that scratch into schools so

00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:19,340
for me I think this is like what what PI

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,020
Academy has been able to do

00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,810
and the fact that you're manufacturing

00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:26,660
them in the UK and etc and have that

00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:29,270
accessibility is fantastic I feel that

00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,250
it's fruit for example in Australia and

00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,930
in the USA I feel that we're still far

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,310
behind on that and the big thing that we

00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:38,630
have is because we have to deal with

00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:44,180
state as well as federal based it's

00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:45,710
nothing I can do about that yeah I was

00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,270
going to say code club this morning gave

00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,520
an amazing talk about what they're doing

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,960
in primary with scratch and so on and

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,340
you have a new curriculum coming right

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,450
like it's in the play it's like it's

00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:58,450
like practically here in Australia yeah

00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,290
yep 2020 so like is coming I've met saw

00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,790
a whole bunch of teachers from the

00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,140
Australia we've been talking about it

00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,910
with us so I mean this is why I've come

00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,250
here because I know the curriculum is

00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,660
coming in but but also one thing with

00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:16,370
code club australia that didn't come up

00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:19,040
this morning so they actually have fun

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,600
being from telstra foundation do

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,770
in-service training for five hundred

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:31,430
teachers in the next year

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:33,710
I teaching the very very poor part of

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,440
Sydney I teach in a part of Sydney that

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:40,360
happened to have a documentary made

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,110
about it called struggle Street so the

00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,550
facilities that we have in our

00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,950
classrooms and the facilities that they

00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,060
have in mosman and etc a really huge and

00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,990
that's something that's not going to

00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,360
change and that's not going to change

00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,130
overnight so I taught in the Bosporus

00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,780
borough in England so when I was doing

00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:55,730
was reply stuff you saw children there

00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,630
from Dagenham fourth poorest place in

00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:01,340
the UK so you know I'm hugely I'm from

00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,940
Dagenham I'm a huge believer that Peter

00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:07,160
sites can move people socially yeah I

00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,960
think that in order to do it though what

00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,790
it really requires is it requires that

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,790
full level engagement and it also

00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,890
requires an acknowledgement of the

00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,410
limitations so for example we're

00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,090
attacking it and I get I've done I've

00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,070
trained kids and I've also trained

00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,620
teenagers and young adults and a lot of

00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:27,010
people say get them while they're young

00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:29,930
but I actually believe that from that

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,640
after school level is a way that you can

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,010
actually get in there and get some of

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,690
that funding around there and also

00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,430
hopefully not have a change of

00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,650
governments because we are actually an

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,510
NBN funded project and we were supposed

00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:44,450
to have a fiber networker now we're all

00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:46,250
running on you know so I think that's

00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,780
one of my biggest bugbear as in the UK

00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,970
as well like we talked a lot here about

00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,490
like I des today about pycharm versus

00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:53,990
online like we had the same we have the

00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:55,550
same problem like the IT infrastructure

00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:59,180
like the networking in the UK sterile

00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:00,770
like I cannot oh my obese 198 having

00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,290
lived in the UK and having lived in

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:07,000
Australia I will swap swap it with you i

00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,000
get 2 megabits in my house if i'm lucky

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,430
but I just you know so I think I think

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,650
what you guys are doing is great but I

00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:17,990
think that that that's also the real big

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,670
key right is to you have to engage that

00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,410
curriculum you have to engage the

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,180
schools you have doing great engage

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,530
teachers you've got to engage teachers

00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,000
you've got to find those superstar

00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,260
teachers who want to push the boundaries

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,460
and actually government will start

00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,260
listening that's what happened in the UK

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,110
grit cool computing at school started

00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,730
nice so what one of the things that and

00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,410
that what I wanted to really get out and

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,560
then I'll pass it on was was what you

00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,390
were talking about

00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,860
how do you get can we come out to

00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,910
Australia and teach it no you don't want

00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,400
to come out to Australia and teach that

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,650
when we the one laptop per child project

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,970
was a success in Australia not because

00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,620
we said a bunch of white people from

00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,660
Sydney out into the remote communities

00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,730
to teach them how to do it because we

00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,070
empowered them to do it themselves and

00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,650
we did it through online learning and

00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:01,950
creating an actual digital educational

00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:03,780
space that's what we're work that's the

00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:06,000
plan i was going to say that that day

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,160
and when you're talking about that I was

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,660
like that's the key part I think to

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,700
really engaging it because you need to

00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,470
do it at a local level same thing that I

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,200
wouldn't want a person from mossman

00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,300
coming into my classroom in Mount Druitt

00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,830
or st. Mary's until it teaching the kids

00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,090
there because this is why a community is

00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,560
so important this is why I like

00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,970
raspberry jam events the same punks

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,830
thats exactly what they are local their

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,450
local people who start them up and then

00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,290
they help are they bring in teachers and

00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,910
they start learning they bring in

00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,770
children they start this so how is that

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,690
a project something that you wanting to

00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,880
go into life is actually taking that on

00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:38,070
into online digital space so that's so

00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,660
we're the moment now how do we scale pie

00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,100
academy right that's the question I get

00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,480
every day like how are we going to scale

00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,590
what we're doing and all the obvious

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,810
answer is how are we going to reach

00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,850
masses of people it's going to be online

00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,230
like that's going to be the answer right

00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,610
I mean we haven't figured it out yet but

00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,610
that's that's where we're headed

00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:59,740
but yeah and I'd also again repeat the a

00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,000
lot of what you're saying those what

00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,770
I've been hearing from Kelly at code

00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,690
club australia as well and that's why i

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:08,430
was so excited to get them as partners

00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:15,180
in is that that I think that's that

00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:15,180
getting engaging with the community and

00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:25,900
tells the Telstra foundation is

00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:29,470
specifically about social yeah but but

00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:32,650
but if that that all those areas you're

00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:37,180
talking about the low social equity

00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:39,280
areas the political engagement of the

00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,710
ones I'm aware of in Australia code club

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,220
australia seems to be the furthest

00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:46,810
progressed that's not saying even

00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,640
they're very powerful great but they

00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,060
seem to be further than the rest of us

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,060
yeah

00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:03,440
so talk about money psf has lots of

00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,880
money apply for psf is the education

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,109
working group that's right yeah we're

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,740
talking about tomorrow so this is the

00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:12,380
way you can get somebody things you've

00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:14,540
got a day or there for us to use yep

00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,369
they're free they're free in terms of

00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,380
their license you can take them remix

00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:20,270
then make them your own I don't mind

00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:27,560
just take them using that's important

00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:34,220
point yeah pining 0 that's there let's

00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:36,890
have a quick okay so right so this is my

00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:38,390
amazing pie game 0 game I wrote oh you

00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,760
can't see it cuz it's a long speech and

00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,190
I right whilst i was watching lightning

00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,510
talks at euro piping so why do you can

00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,850
see my alien year is just going around

00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:50,450
around around and you can't see my

00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:55,369
terminal screen as well so if i click on

00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:57,440
him he says eek if i miss him you said

00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:01,700
you missed me so let's try and get him

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,369
um he's a Zeke right so amazing game I'm

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,820
sure you'll all agree um but let me just

00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:10,100
show you the code using nano yes I'm

00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:13,670
that advanced by using that name and

00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:18,350
well I made that game using this code so

00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:21,320
this is play game 0 so Dan Pope he came

00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:23,750
to plant corn UK so we have an education

00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,950
track at PyCon UK we have around 40

00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,480
teachers who attend in l a-- bidding

00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,560
it's about four years and some really

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,359
good way to bring teachers and

00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,820
developers together and because

00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,470
developers often say things like wow you

00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,480
can get kids into programming let me

00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,210
just write 16 lines of code for you boom

00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,680
why aren't you doing that and the

00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,450
teachers would come and go you kidding

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,400
me like where would I start you're using

00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,380
the event handlers using object

00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,350
orientated programming you know I'm

00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:51,410
trying to teach you know sequencing

00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:53,030
repetition you know conditionals I can't

00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,340
do that with what what you're showing me

00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:57,640
so he went away and he took the pie game

00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,020
library and he stripped quite a lot out

00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,700
and he's come up with this called pygame

00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,050
0 so it's basically teaching without a

00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,900
boilerplate there's no

00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:08,150
with paper using play game so what it

00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,890
means is that you can create these kind

00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,780
of little functions that do different

00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,410
things at the first so I could teaching

00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,900
a lesson we could first draw a screen

00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:19,700
right really quickly and easily I can

00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,640
change the size of that screen and

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:26,180
colorism in that screen this one here is

00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:28,970
just my my alien moving right so that's

00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,500
really easy and this one here is it's my

00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,170
conditional like when I click on it it

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,030
says eek or if I miss it said something

00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,970
else and so actually some really nice

00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:40,160
construction i can teach in parts where

00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,770
you can show real progression and so

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,960
like Sam arranways always uses this

00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:46,220
example like you have children he's

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,170
Satan what you want to do we're going to

00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,870
code today what you want to do and they

00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,830
say why would I make a game okay right

00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:54,140
yeah this sounds good we're going to

00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,730
make a game game sounds good what you

00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,900
like a game to be like and then they'll

00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,610
just blow your mind what they'll be like

00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,800
why I want my game to me in space I

00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,940
wanted to be stars and planets and

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,920
actually is going to be people weaned

00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,940
like UFOs and fighter planes they're

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,520
going to come at me from all directions

00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:10,610
and get a fire at me and it's going to

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,910
be like aliens it's gonna be amazing and

00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:18,500
you go right okay so I can make you a

00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:20,210
black square look all that space and I

00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,610
can make like a little rectangle here

00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:24,800
we'll call that the spaceship child has

00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:27,110
moved on they have gone right you've

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,310
lost them already and that's kind of a

00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:31,970
prop so how can we make meaningful

00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:33,230
progress very quickly and keep that

00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,700
engagement that's what's engaging about

00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,650
scratch right you can create your own

00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,480
staff you can move it you can animate it

00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:41,360
and you want to keep that up so this is

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,400
where pygame zero kind of steps in I

00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,280
think fills that gap very quickly and

00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,650
simply using Python programming with

00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,800
concepts that are quite abstract still

00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:54,200
quite low level yeah so that's kind of

00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,820
pie idea and if you want to have a go

00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,740
yourself like it there's not like a

00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,450
proper installer out

00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:04,560
for it yet at the moment is all on Dan's

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:07,670
website so if you just plug in zero I

00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,670
don't have internet access

00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:20,850
of course it's going to be on the screen

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:24,610
let me find it for you so you just go to

00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:27,340
my game 0 and you'll find this so you

00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,960
can get windows on OS X so the OS x

00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,840
install is a little bit long of course

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,940
it's Mac but I did this and it worked on

00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,120
linux there's even instructions of

00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,950
course for a spy which is easiest so you

00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,650
can get started pretty quickly he also

00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,930
has like a step-by-step tutorial which

00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:49,990
is what I used to make my really rubbish

00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:52,270
game but it's all on based on the same

00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:54,010
website so you just Google plugin 0

00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,720
you'll find it i'll talk more about I've

00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:58,930
got better links in my presentation

00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:01,750
tomorrow just want to add on to what you

00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:03,490
see it on a partner Hanlon's website you

00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,500
can visit there's a version of the

00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:08,290
minecraft by code that rope whips on a

00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,390
regular minecraft servers on a pc on

00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:12,070
multiplayer servers so you can have

00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,810
multiple people in the same server and

00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,100
they can be creating blocks with flags

00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,180
and code they're running on the machines

00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,180
get really really

00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:26,070
yeah stuff about code he's a dude

00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:31,440
big difference and this is maybe

00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:34,140
slightly but one thing I noticed big

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,480
difference is with the workshop stuff in

00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:38,069
the UK so in Australia for example all

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,710
of our workshops never met we do with

00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:42,750
kids everybody must be checked by the

00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:44,549
police they must have gone through we

00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:47,430
have epilepsy training they must have

00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:49,950
gone through child meant first aid etc

00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:54,780
when I was doing stuff in the UK the

00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:58,140
last time I did it there was back in i'm

00:56:54,780 --> 00:57:01,200
going to say 2012 and that wasn't the

00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:03,059
case ok so what we doing DBS checks so

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,770
everyone should be checked obviously if

00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:06,150
parents are taking their children to a

00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,650
workshop like it it's their

00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,940
responsibility to find out where and all

00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,920
the people running the workshop up in

00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,839
dds hang wait wait wait wait wait you

00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,030
mean it's the parents responsibility

00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:17,609
well yeah i think it is if I was taking

00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:20,309
my children to a workshop I would expect

00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:21,690
that the people running it were DBS

00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:23,910
checked and i thought i would ask i

00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:25,410
would say okay so you're it's mandated

00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:27,480
for our stuff because it's all under

00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:29,460
government and it's all curriculum based

00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:34,260
and teaching basic actually is mandated

00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:36,930
by law so you it is that that isn't yet

00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,240
and also when i'm doing stuff in the USA

00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:40,890
all different states are different but

00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,319
the projects that i've done it with

00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,910
that's something that they take on but

00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:47,190
in australia there is a man Dacian of

00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:49,589
law so a lot of the stuff that happens

00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:51,059
at rewired state for example would never

00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:52,829
ever legally be allowed to happen in

00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:54,599
australia because of laws with you and

00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:57,420
Perry wide state like young you I'd

00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,010
state is a bit dodgy I think like

00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,089
they're kind of like so they use this

00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,740
example that the kids are on work

00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:02,940
experience so I'm not sure if I'm one

00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,260
hundred percent behind that but they do

00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,990
expect all their people who are running

00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,940
it to be DBS they do because I actually

00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:12,180
had an incident there and pushed for it

00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,859
I like and that was just something i run

00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,170
a center last year and I was the DBS

00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:18,480
checked ok cool so that's that's really

00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,920
good to hear so as I said back in 2012

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,839
and that was as an Australian something

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,160
that really shocked me and that's a lot

00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:25,079
of people want to come and join our

00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,940
project and want to even just come in

00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:29,280
for a night and do something with the

00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,140
kids but I can't have them on until

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,690
they've gone through all these checks

00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:36,570
yeah and is it difficult for those jacks

00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:38,100
and it's not difficult no they just have

00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:39,270
to initiate it themselves they have the

00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,770
first aid training and they've got to

00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:43,050
pay for their early epilepsy training

00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:45,420
and self but as I said I work with

00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,950
highly vulnerable yes so how long does

00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,270
it last as well so if you go through

00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:50,520
that training do you have to let me do

00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:53,970
it every year to do I think the new

00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,730
where the new police chick I think it's

00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:58,860
every now every 2 12 months or 24 months

00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:00,420
that you have to get it redone but

00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,270
that's anywhere in teaching if you're

00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,100
teaching teachers aid meant or anything

00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,600
like that yeah in scores like we have to

00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,710
have it right but like yeah for which so

00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,090
this is good information you can share

00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,650
with the community right about how they

00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,060
can go through those steps and they can

00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,580
get a certification that they need

00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,020
that's all really helpful yeah it's just

00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,310
interesting to hear you say that you

00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,690
would expect that from a parent because

00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:21,750
I would not expect a parent to

00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:22,950
understand that so any okay I think

00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,390
they're quite like parents are pretty

00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:26,030
hot in that right like they would just

00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:29,160
leave their children with strangers

00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:30,570
without ensuring that I think any

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,540
Australian parent what I just think we

00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:38,630
have it heavier mandated by law I just I

00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,630
don't know that's good to hear

00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:48,400
I have a question coming from the

00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:52,210
developer side last year I was involved

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:55,720
with the junior robocup out of school I

00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:57,809
was wondering what avenues you see

00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:00,130
developers getting involved in helping

00:59:57,809 --> 01:00:03,940
education in their spare time because

01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:05,650
obviously I'm working as a developer so

01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,029
it depends like what how did you meet

01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:08,920
how can you help which means what levels

01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:11,049
you've helped is it kind of donating

01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,989
five hours of your time per month to

01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:16,119
have perhaps help hack on like pygame

01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,859
zero to get it ready for people to use

01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:19,539
in schools or is it you know going

01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:21,910
through all the checks that you need to

01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:23,559
run a workshop in a school is it working

01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:25,359
for coderdojo or running a code public

01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:27,460
what's your level what you want to do I

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,489
don't find the security checks too

01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:33,819
onerous actually when I had to do it I

01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:35,529
just basically applied and they did the

01:00:33,819 --> 01:00:37,089
check and said it was all good but they

01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:40,890
said I was okay to do it in the meantime

01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:40,890
all the check was being processed so I

01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:50,769
well don't be alone in those rows with

01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:52,509
those children I wasn't mine it was

01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:54,579
worth it yeah so I found it really

01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:58,089
encouraging because I was dealing with

01:00:54,579 --> 01:01:02,680
you five and your six kids with the LEGO

01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:04,180
robots to see their passion for doing

01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,249
some really complicated stuff in fact

01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,799
our team ended up making it to the to

01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:11,920
the Nationals they won the state and the

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:14,259
local competitions and I barely gave any

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,359
advice except you know when they got

01:01:14,259 --> 01:01:18,519
stuck on something totally crazy so it

01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:20,799
was encouraging to see and that's prompt

01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:23,710
me to think well how else can I help out

01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:26,259
because i think the hacking things or

01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:29,170
making things reducing boilerplate in

01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:31,089
some code i think is something that many

01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:33,880
developers could get behind in making

01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:36,369
something think so so tomorrow i was

01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,930
going to talk about the python python

01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:40,539
software foundation's education

01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:42,160
workgroup and so i will show you how to

01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:43,900
sign up for that tomorrow because there

01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,970
are lots of ways you can get involved to

01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,150
help what we're trying to achieve which

01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:51,070
i will go through tomorrow

01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,070
one time but do you know

01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,790
I should like wave this around

01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:03,530
I didn't write this but you should read

01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:07,100
it so yes so sitting around the Python

01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:09,740
and education booklet such as Nick

01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:14,810
Ptolemy in the UK put together with

01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:17,870
O'Reilly it's just a oh yeah oh sure

01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:20,990
everyone should read at me and it's a

01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:23,120
free online ebook as well and it just

01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:24,560
basically summarizes a bunch of the

01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,130
resources that are available out there

01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:31,060
and some of the rationales for around by

01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:31,060
finding education

01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:42,500
there is there is a case study of okay

01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,560
so thank you very much everybody who's

01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:47,930
stuck it out to the end of our

01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,020
first-ever Python in education minicom

01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:55,040
fat bike on australia the conference

01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:58,579
venue is open for another vid over half

01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,470
an hour so i'll still be around carrie

01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:03,920
Ann will still be around for your

01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:08,230
checked bag I'm here Oh physically I'm

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:11,420
still here ladies still here and so if

01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:13,609
so I just say one thing to that time

01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,079
boycott actually had something on

01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:17,569
education was off in one of those

01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:19,579
struggling teachers at company 2015 all

01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:22,640
the way through as the only one until

01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:24,290
this year yes nice to see something or

01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,089
education I couldn't agree more i think

01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,650
this fact this has been one of the best

01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:28,970
i've been to a lot of education tracks

01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,280
recently this is one the best one

01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:32,599
because her teachers stand up talk about

01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,819
what they're doing in their classroom

01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:36,560
that doesn't happen in the UK right i

01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:38,089
think you should be really proud that

01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,329
