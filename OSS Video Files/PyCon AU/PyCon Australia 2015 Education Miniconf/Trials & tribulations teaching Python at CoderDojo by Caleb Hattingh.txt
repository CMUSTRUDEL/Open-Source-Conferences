Title: Trials & tribulations teaching Python at CoderDojo by Caleb Hattingh
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Education Miniconf
Description: 
	This talk will relate the experience of teaching coding, including Python, to a (nominally) 6-18 age group at a local Brisbane CoderDojo for 2015 Term 1 and 2.

Scratch and Alice have become very popular for teaching beginner coding at CoderDojo events. Languages such as Python, and even HTML/CSS, are more difficult to introduce, partly because more skills are required before something "useful" can be created, and partly because the "building blocks" are usually not presented with the same visual immediacy as Scratch, and similar environments. This talk presents some of the difficulties found in transitioning from graphical environments to Python, and observations in using existing tools for learning Python with younger students.


PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,780
so one of the hardest parts the learning

00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,700
process is when we reflect back on

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,390
situations that didn't go as well as we

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,369
hoped so Kayla padding has a generously

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,750
volunteered to share some of the

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,810
challenges he faced in introducing

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,840
Python to students at coderdojo and the

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,160
lessons he learned in the process okay

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,500
yep that's on that's good okay so

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,780
teaching partner coderdojo I'm an

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,610
imposter I'm an imposter here in two

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,940
ways the first way is I'm not a teacher

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,650
unlike most of you know no training and

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,300
education whatsoever the second way is

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,220
I'm also not qualified as a software

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,809
engineer I'm actually qualified as a

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,320
chemical engineer it just so happens

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,850
that I've been using Python in in the

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,769
course of my work for for quite a while

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,199
doing engineering calculations modeling

00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,600
simulation reactor design and that kind

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,949
of thing i really enjoy programming in

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,690
Python and I in hindsight I probably

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,510
should have studied a different thing

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,430
than what I did do but I switched now

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,070
and I started to start up for teaching

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,320
coding online so if you're interested

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,630
about that ask me but we're here to talk

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,630
about the attempt to try to teach Python

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,220
coderdojo so my goals in the talk are

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,960
pretty much just to give you a bird's

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,050
eye view into what it what one of my

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,550
classes is like one of our classes and

00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,310
go through some mistakes that a non

00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,890
educator is likely to make like me that

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,780
they are many and various and these are

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,520
my observations only they won't apply to

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,690
any other mentors that coderdojo and

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,160
they probably want to apply to any other

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:46,470
coder dojos but it may be of some use to

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,980
you if you get non educators to do

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,350
teaching for you in some capacity so

00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,760
quickly about coderdojo you probably

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,450
have all heard about it it's a global

00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,940
movement it's volunteer driven for us it

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,790
happens on Saturdays in the midday the

00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,380
kids are very wide range so 7017 that's

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,440
pretty much like year what you have for

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,300
your five through to year 12 and I

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,649
started in January and I've been going

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,649
every Saturday since then

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm going too fast I'll slow down but to

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,830
give you a picture into what our class

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,830
looks like this is set the term side

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,390
library kids come in they stream through

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,330
the doors we take down the registration

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,830
details and they set up plug in we try

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,060
to get everyone set up on the Wi-Fi the

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,130
Wi-Fi doesn't seem to allow too many

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,210
connections at the same time so we have

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,380
to stagger that over a couple of minutes

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,970
and that's pretty much it the kids run

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,490
on tasks which I'll get to in a second

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,630
and at the end of the class kids who are

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,250
proud of what they've built and the one

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,690
presented to their is the quest risk the

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,890
class they go up to podium and they

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,960
present their work and they talk through

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,460
their designs and here is one of our

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,680
kids showing a scratch design that he

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,960
did kids really love presenting their

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,270
work and getting feedback so to go back

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,520
to what a class is like we don't run a

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,410
taut curriculum kids come in and and the

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,180
way our dojo specifically works which is

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,130
not the same as all of them mentors

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,380
pitch different ideas about what they

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,120
would offer to kids and the kids decide

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,610
what they want to do the younger kids

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,200
tend to be drawn to scratch we have one

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,850
or two kids who who use a thing called

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,489
Ellis which is very similar scratch but

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,989
it's in a 3d world and we started then

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,900
this year trying to push HTML and CSS so

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,640
that kids can get web pages up and at

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,860
the same time iPads are going they're

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,290
playing games some one of the kids would

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,150
be playing music from itunes people are

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,890
moving in and out of the room for

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,959
bathroom breaks we break at lunch time

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,970
the class is the two-hour class in the

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,470
middle of a Saturday so it's pretty

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,300
chaotic and it's pretty vibrant and

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,709
there's a lot going on and kids tend to

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,150
ask mentors when they want help with

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,739
whatever they're doing it and it could

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,790
be any of these things or even none of

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,560
these things one of the kids might try

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,709
something completely different and into

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,150
this Maelstrom I I thought I would try

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,150
to teach some kids Python

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,680
so in term one we mainly did scratch and

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,030
and web and in turn to our thought I'll

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,550
try and introduce some Python sybase

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,720
some basic Python to the kids turn three

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,490
starts next week and I'm going to be

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,050
good doing that as well and some of the

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:17,450
lessons that I've learned up I'll be

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,450
incorporating into into turn 3 syllabus

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,100
my first big lesson is in that

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,500
environment where graphical tools rule

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,290
and they make sounds easily and colors

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,750
easily it's really hard to sell Python

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,560
it's really hard unless you have a PI

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,030
game aspect going on or you're

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,010
connecting to Minecraft or you've got

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,420
some kind of flash going it's really

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,480
hard to sell the idea that you type

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,020
characters into a terminal and more

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,160
characters come out so that's kind of

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,390
the expression you get from a lot of the

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,880
younger kids like they look at you like

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,840
really really really I'm not going to do

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,310
that never mind that but I got a few I

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,500
got a few kids so before we get into

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,450
that just to give you a quick idea about

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,800
what scratches and how it works I think

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,800
hands went up earlier to set with most

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,940
people had heard about scratch a lot of

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,860
kids you scratch on a lot of younger

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,480
kids you scratch and they get very very

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,180
good at scratch really really proficient

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,860
they build incredibly complex programs

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,870
by dragging and dropping these blocks

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,570
that plug in together like jigsaw

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,130
puzzles you can't really make any kind

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,990
of mistakes there are no syntax errors

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,120
that you can make that is completely

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,800
removed from you all you have to focus

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,430
on is the logic and figuring out how

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,260
scratch interprets your logic decisions

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,240
I'm not that optimistic about the use of

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,060
scratchy in the classroom and that's

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,250
just my opinion you shouldn't take that

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,850
as gospel but from what we've seen from

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,830
what I've seen is being unable to fix

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,600
syntax errors is actually a problem when

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,370
we transition some kids who are really

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
really good at scratch to an environment

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,050
even just HTML where they have to type

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,400
the code in small problems with syntax

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,130
errors and joining blocks up and

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,050
completing tags become massive problems

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,270
in trying to get the project done it's

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,770
it's it's a huge stumbling block to try

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,360
and have to deal with syntax errors when

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,190
the kids already have a vague idea about

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,750
what they want to accomplish so it's

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,310
like one part of the skill set has

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,169
advanced much further than the other pie

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,060
the skill set which is dealing with

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,630
things like syntax errors where did I

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,970
save that

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,500
my system I can't find the folder did

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,340
you save the file Owen I just closed it

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,740
I said no to the dialog box how software

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,630
works is insulated from you in the

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,460
scratch environment the basic building

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,250
blocks of Windows and how software works

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,780
and we see that immediately when a kid

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,370
who does very very good work on scratch

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,010
transitions into an environment where

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,310
they have to type coding and the other

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,690
thing is typing being able to find the

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,370
special characters in the keyboard turns

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,410
out to be another huge stumbling block

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,690
that delays the process of learning a

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,980
great deal to find where the dollar sign

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,190
is to find with the greater than sign is

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,990
and that kind of thing so what is

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,680
interesting is that the kids develop the

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,660
skills in thinking logically in scratch

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,430
but fall short when they have to try to

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,370
enter those ideas in a new language and

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,630
then on top of those basic problems you

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,950
also have the problems of learning a

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,520
language and the abstraction that Peter

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:10,080
Peter spoke about earlier but that's

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
just about scratch so what we're talking

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,990
about here is kids who have already done

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,950
scratch in the past become very good at

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,720
it now that transitioned into a mindset

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,760
of wanting to learn Python so I got a

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,780
couple involved Corey Henry and Dan they

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,080
said they were going to do it they were

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,940
going to give it a try so Corey want to

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,050
do code Academy he had already started

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,370
on some of the lessons but he was

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,940
struggling and he was hoping to get some

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,380
help at coderdojo Henry under and I got

00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,990
them set up with the Piton education

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,090
Edition the education Edition comes with

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,200
a learning python tutorial built in and

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,090
I thought that was great and code

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,670
Academy's learning python course is

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,750
great it has many uses and the plan was

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,490
that they were just going to do the

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,960
exercises presented to them in these and

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,790
in myself and a couple of the other

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,410
mentors that new Python would pitch in

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,300
to help with some of the questions as

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,810
and when required but basically the

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,810
lessons would run themselves right no no

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,060
that doesn't work that that doesn't work

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,730
the problem is not with the tools the

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,530
problem is with my approach to teaching

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,330
which is terrible it's a terrible way to

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,240
do no lesson preparation and think that

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,820
tools are going to solve your problems

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,040
the the most important thing was despite

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,560
that these tools are good they're

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,470
pitched at a much higher level than what

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,060
these kids are at in learning to code

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,310
I don't think that it's wrong to

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,810
introduce Python at the age groups that

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,700
they were in we're pretty much the King

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,700
sedan was about 11 and Corey and Henry

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,930
were 12 to 13 that can't age group right

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,700
so yes six cr7 yet these tools are great

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,020
and the content is great but they're way

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,969
way too advanced and this is what I

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,970
discovered in the in process of doing

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,460
the teaching so first we'll do

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,690
Codecademy I'm not criticizing code

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,370
Academy it's a great tool but what I

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,220
want to point out is some of the

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,290
problems I observe firsthand with kids

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,030
that were too young trying to do these

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,080
exercises the things that jumped out at

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,550
me so this is the code Academy screen it

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,320
runs in the browser you get a question

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,440
on the left and you get your input area

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,510
on the right the example on the left

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,010
gives you a string literal on which you

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,630
call the function lower and what it does

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,780
is it produces a lowercase version of

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:19,950
the thing the task is to call lower case

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,540
on the variable name parent right all of

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,310
the kids who did this example try to

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,980
lower case on Norwegian blue which is

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,960
also string literal without every single

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,610
one did it they check the example on the

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,720
left and they put lower on the right and

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,180
couldn't understand why I didn't work

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,380
they didn't read all the text because

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,270
there was an example so they're based

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:40,800
what they did an example this is an

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,990
example of something that happened over

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,240
and over again with many questions the

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,420
example would be subtly different in a

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,470
structural way to what the task was and

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,030
that was a huge problem because the

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,710
examples were we're actually causing

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,720
confusion rather than helping with with

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,040
the task so I think if you're gonna

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,050
present examples to kids especially

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,270
younger kids the example should be a

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,550
pretty good match against what the task

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,050
actually is instead of calling it on a

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,400
string literal rather call on a variable

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,480
name in the example so that when they do

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,820
it in the code looks the same way here's

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,920
another typical question I think this

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,510
comes up multiple times so use of the

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,520
word modular modulo is a word that does

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,640
not come up in normal speak in all

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,040
speech it's it's entirely used in

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,140
programming languages so when that word

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
appears on the page the kids think of

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,990
nothing else but the strange new word

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,990
that has appeared

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,170
maybe we should call it remainder if

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,630
we're teaching younger kids to code

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,820
because when they started doing math in

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,470
school they already have dealt with

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,060
remainders you divide a number another

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,070
number and this a little bit left that's

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,650
an obvious concept modulo is non-obvious

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,090
concept so even though what is happening

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,590
is easy the use of the wrong language

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,710
makes it very difficult for younger kids

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,210
to learn and computer sciences is

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,220
specifically bad with us it's filled

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,350
with jargon just like chemical

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,120
engineering and many other fields where

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,270
we use different words to mean things

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,530
that have everyday meanings one more

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,880
this was something that came up a lot as

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,070
well is that their instructions are

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,900
given in various places in the page so

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,700
the kids didn't know should they follow

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,060
what said they're old what it should

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,770
follow their it's a very busy screen and

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,140
again using different words to mean

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,940
commonplace things this description here

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,380
on the on the top left says string now

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,820
let's look at string list

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,470
straightforward string method to in turn

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,170
on strings into strings for example and

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,700
then the example works with numbers this

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,800
is something that happened frequently

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,360
that the example that would be given

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,080
would be structurally different to what

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,080
the task was

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,990
we should probably also call strings

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,370
text if we're working with with with the

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,529
advocates for programming because the

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,570
words string to be used to refer to text

00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:59,240
is not very common it's common in

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,529
programming but as soon as he introduced

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,330
a new word that has a different

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,160
different meaning from the commonplace

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,830
term for the same thing it introduces

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,330
complexity and managing complexity is is

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,430
off the charts difficult with stuff like

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,830
this we haven't even got into the logic

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:17,600
of the code yet this is just how the

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:20,570
question is raised okay so pycharm I hit

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,540
that too quickly yep hi dramatization

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,700
edition it's great tools of tastic tool

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,380
I should have done with Thea suggested

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,670
which is make my own exercises but I

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,100
didn't I just used the bullet in

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,170
learning python tutorial thinking that

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,850
it was it had already been curated or

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,459
tested in some capacity and it would be

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,290
suitable it's suitable if you're old

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,690
enough to understand and possibly have

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,820
some exposure to programming before if

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,550
you're new to it and python is your

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,160
first language to start with is a huge

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,660
information overload but in this

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
particular question in this particular

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,529
question I want to draw you something

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,900
that happened frequently in in the patch

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,230
on education edition in this set of

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,750
learning exercises the variable name is

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,430
matching the contents of the variable

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,520
hello equals hello world equals world

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,810
this happens over and over and over and

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,550
over christian off the question and the

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,650
kids would call me over for every single

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:20,330
question to ask a case of which one is

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:23,080
the thing that i need to do right hello

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,080
versus hello

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:32,800
a much more complicated question

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,360
greetings vs. greetings in this

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,830
particular case greeting gets defined

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,450
twice and the second one overwrites the

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,800
former one and the screen is real really

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,820
busy as well right there's stuff

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,589
happening on the left you don't know

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,529
what's going on in the bottom that the

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,779
text of the task is quite long young

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,279
kids do not read that much I try to get

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,010
my kids to read but they but they don't

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,760
like to read that much greeting versus

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,080
greeting okay and and and this was

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,200
another thing with the symptomatic of

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,580
the of the built-in exercises Thea's

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,210
exercises are much better they're

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,410
simpler then more to the point this does

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,730
not roll off the tongue boolean

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,110
operators compare statements return

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,730
results boolean values the boolean

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,700
operator and returns true in expressions

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,140
from SWA blah blah blah blah 10 year

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,310
olds do not read that they don't

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,960
understand the first word in the

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,029
sentence because bulleen is a word that

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,040
does not get used in commonplace speech

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,990
it actually just means true or false on

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,029
an off that's all it means right but

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,830
when the word is introduced young kids

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,029
they don't understand and when you don't

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,339
understand what the first part of

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,750
question is saying you're pretty much

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,770
guaranteed not to understand the last

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,089
part of the question it's it's kind of

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,529
like that that's that that's how it

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,910
reads to them they don't know what it

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,140
means or where it's going or what it's

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,300
about and I don't even do the question

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,510
sleepy very sleepy that's incredibly

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,510
dull

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,780
the one last bit that I wanted to

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,670
mention that that was surprisingly

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,680
confusing to the kids but maybe it

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,170
shouldn't be is the way the way the

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,750
questions are structured in in the

00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,150
default course for education edition is

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,890
that the instruction is written in place

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,410
where you're supposed to change the text

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,090
and put the right stuff in but the kids

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,250
thought that was part of the program and

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,860
they couldn't understand whether they

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,900
should delete that or add on to it or

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,630
make a new line and into the right

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,430
answer and of course the fault is mine

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,080
right not the education edition it was

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,150
my fault I didn't explain to them how

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,060
that works before letting them do the

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:34,440
exercises so it became pretty clear the

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,490
first day that we introduced these that

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,840
they would call me over and say I don't

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,040
understand where do I begin okay you do

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,540
this then you do that then you do that

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,830
great they get the question right the

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,140
movement next question the same

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,420
questions come through again not the

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,060
fault of the software my fault I did not

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,300
think to explain any of any of those

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,860
details that we just went through and

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,870
this is a problem where I would like to

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,540
be spending my time explaining how to

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,130
structure their thoughts in code but I

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,240
spend all my time explaining these other

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:07,440
things what words mean and how to how to

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,240
enter the building the instructions so

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,380
despite using very good tools that many

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,570
many people use to learn programming it

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,710
failed in in our situation because the

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,390
kids couldn't understand the questions

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,950
they couldn't understand what needed to

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,450
be done so it was really challenging and

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,070
I was I was struggling to think how i

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,720
would i would go about this what should

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,010
i do should i look online she'll try and

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,510
find exercises that someone else has

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,490
said it worked would work in our

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,990
situation did they do their exercises

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,090
for older kids I've got younger kids

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,030
they have particular needs that may not

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,130
work for the other exercises need a plan

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,880
quick so what I decided to do which is

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,090
what I should have done in the first

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,040
place was made my own exercises granted

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,570
I probably would have made exercises

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,420
that were too difficult and made some of

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,560
the same mistakes without having had the

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,350
experience of seeing what the problems

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,990
were so in hindsight I think it was

00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,550
actually beneficial for me to have

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,880
experienced those those real problems

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,250
not too much my kids because they were

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,069
frustrated and ready to give up and just

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:13,569
try and do something else so my strategy

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,459
was this strip everything away I install

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,810
the text editor for them and I showed

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,550
them where the command prompt lives on

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,860
their computer and we got Python going

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,390
and I showed them that if they put some

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,069
Python code into text editor and they

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,020
save a file and I show them in the file

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,579
manager where the file is then we make

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,230
the command prompt to change into that

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,560
folder and then they can type Python

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,570
space filename and in the code runs that

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,480
was my strategy and then what code would

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,180
we do based on my experience of using

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,920
the previous tools that were exceedingly

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,390
complex I decided well if I'm going to

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,890
make a mistake anyway I'm rather going

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,340
to make a mistake in the direction of

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,860
having very very short code do as little

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,110
as possible try to do something real

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,670
world and then the kids can edit it and

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,400
make it change what it does that that

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,680
was my strategy and it turned out that

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,420
I've worked exceedingly well but for

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,780
these kids at their ages and where they

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,400
were this was incredibly successful it

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,040
turns out that starting with something

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,510
that actually works is much better than

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,310
starting with something that that's

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,620
broken and asking them to complete it

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,700
because they make broken things along

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,530
the way starting from something that

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,330
works they can break it and see okay

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,890
that change doesn't work but I wanted to

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,510
do this how do I do that and they can

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,280
change in that they can evolve while

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:27,040
keeping the program working to something

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,950
that works differently so have a couple

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,720
of examples of the exercises that I

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,060
dreamed up and I don't make the claim of

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,070
the best examples probably we could come

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,510
up with something better but they are

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,730
what I dreamed up and I had a bunch of

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,050
them and I hitched them to the kids to

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,850
whichever one that they wanted to get

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,200
started with whatever they were drawn to

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,810
and then they would open the code and

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,970
text editor look at the code not really

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,110
understand what it said but they could

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,540
run it in the command prompt and they

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,770
could see what it produced and then the

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,900
ask me questions about the code said

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,850
okay well can I make it rather say this

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,950
I wanted to do that how do i change that

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,090
how does this work and then I could

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,980
answer the questions i could say okay

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,420
well if you want to do that then you use

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,590
a loop like this and basically this

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,480
walks over this thing until that

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,100
condition is true and they could play

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,410
with a true and false increase number

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,320
lower number

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,690
so this was our first program that I got

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,150
them started in the beauty of python is

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,330
that's a complete program four lines

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,850
complete program and it does something

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,770
what that program does is if you run it

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,590
on the command line any text you type

00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:31,320
after the Python file name will be

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,270
returned to you in uppercase so it's

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,920
really just it's it's a command prompt

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,860
wrapper around the the uppercase

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,330
function in Python so the kids got that

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,770
into their text editor and there was

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,820
nothing else on the screen that was all

00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,740
they could see it was just those four

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,110
lines so even though there's some

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,130
complexity there there was no noise so

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,050
they could ask me what does that thing

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,300
do import sis and I could say oh that

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,860
loads a library for system functions it

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,660
can let you do stuff like that arg v

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,480
there comes from sis Oh what does that

00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,550
do ORV so the stuff you type after the

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,020
Python file name it gets in that thing

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,910
and then you can stick it into that text

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,620
over there okay that's interesting what

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,090
is joined you I said I don't worry about

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,590
that we'll get to that later what is

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,550
print 20 that prints to your screen

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,660
doesn't printer printer okay good so

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,240
they could run it and then I would ask

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,250
them if you wanted to make a different

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,190
program that produced all lowercase

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,570
letters and not applique s'what where

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,450
would you go how would you begin why

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,650
would you try and approach Corey thought

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,080
about it for a minute and then he said

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,210
maybe we should change the word upper to

00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,030
lower would that work and I said try it

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,050
let's see let's just give that a shot

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,790
change it to lower only works they had

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,970
and he now has made a new program from

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,310
this program that does what he intended

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,550
it to do and then I could show the kids

00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,630
how to find where all those things

00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,250
appear online and go to the Python

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,260
documents and they can type it into

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,910
Google and I could find an example and

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,620
stack overflow or something that I can

00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,210
show you how it works this was

00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,180
incredibly successful this was the first

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:04,110
time they actually did any code and we

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,030
did three days of code Academy and

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,550
PyCharm education edition so three

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,350
Saturdays we wasted on those exercise

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,520
trying to fight through the difficult

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,100
questions and this was the first time

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,210
with a small for line program that they

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,280
actually felt that they were doing

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,500
something complete program that they

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,920
could run produce output and then start

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,110
tinkering with

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,820
guess a number so here we have a while

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,500
loop where we guess a random number and

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,620
we keep getting a message to the screen

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,370
saying guess my number gets my number so

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:36,050
Henry said well it's really hard to get

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,240
a number if we make that a hundred it's

00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,500
you know it'll take forever so then we

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,420
said well what about if we give feedback

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,330
on the number if you know maybe you can

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,770
say you're too high or too low what

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,440
could we do this so Henry said okay

00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,300
he'll try and make those changes so we

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,800
put if statements under there and he

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,140
played around with that for pretty much

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,490
an hour and a half trying to get the if

00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,230
statements working and I would tell him

00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,970
how the conditions worked he put his own

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,580
messages in he changed all that text to

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,690
make it a bit more fun and he started

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,750
with a small program and he made a

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,980
better program based on one that was

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,000
working and every time along the way

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,230
when he would make a change you could

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,850
see what the what the result of the

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,260
change was whether it worked or not or

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:17,270
whether the logic worked in the way that

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:20,270
it was supposed to pass phrases this

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,690
code here is a tiny version of the code

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,710
I used to generate my passwords online

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,800
slightly more complicated than the other

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,110
ones but what I found was you don't need

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,250
to get hung up on the syntax kids can

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,230
avoid things that they don't really

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,670
understand as long as it works they can

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,860
focus in on the bits that they're

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,110
interested in changing so that Google

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,720
10,000 English is a word list big big

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,490
bunch of words and full range in for it

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,960
just draws for random words out and

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,610
print them to the screen but that's what

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,560
it does picks for random words and puts

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,240
them out to the screen what if we

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,590
arrange 100 what if we ranges asked oh

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,630
well that will work too but it's pretty

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,600
big password you can't remember that you

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:59,330
can't type it out then we start talking

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,280
about well why for why not eight and

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,020
then we we going to discussion about

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,370
online security and why you should use a

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,350
different password for every site and

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,700
with this particular question some of

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,230
the parents got involved at coderdojo

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,490
and they started saying well I use the

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,020
same password everywhere because I can't

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,240
remember them and I said well that's

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,920
really bad because when one of your

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,330
sites gets hacked the hackers try that

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,370
same password on all the other sites

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,810
with your email combination and you know

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:26,280
then you get beached everywhere

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:29,190
and one of the kids Dan he he had a Mac

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,710
any new the key combination to get the

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,630
emoji window he opened that text file up

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,520
in the text editor and he deleted all

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,860
the words and he put a bunch of bunches

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,690
of emojis in there and then he modified

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,670
the program so it would print her you

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,810
know random strings of emojis which I

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,930
thought was kind of kind of interesting

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,400
i do I wasn't expecting that to happen

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,390
he thought that was really cool random

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,290
random emoji faces okay the last example

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,520
was a fake virus scanner it asks in the

00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,660
beginning do you want to scan for

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,910
viruses yes or no and if you say yes it

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,970
prints out dots randomly and then at the

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,620
end it says virus detected and the kids

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,270
had a lot of fun with us and they wrote

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,800
terrible things at the bottom about what

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,040
was happening to cut your computer your

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,660
hard drive is getting deleted and we

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,460
started talking about well how do actual

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,070
virus scanners work why do they look for

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,470
do they look for files special file

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,720
names and we started talking about how

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,920
computers are the computer structure of

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,410
computers and how you have the disk and

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,880
you have memory and when you attach your

00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,710
computer to other systems think singing

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,110
a copied over the network so we start

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,090
discussions on these simple programs

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,140
into more complicated areas and they

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,600
start to think about what they want the

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,190
program's to do rather than get hung up

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,380
on the syntax so the output of that

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,790
looks like that so it says do you want a

00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,560
scan for viruses if you say yes then a

00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,990
prince dots randomly and the NCS virus

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,400
detected and the kids took that basic

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,830
frame we can they built onto it and they

00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,300
made it say all that things and and so

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:02,160
on so bye bye week six in term two so

00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,720
the last three sessions we were working

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,490
this way rather than we had in the

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,400
beginning and it was much much more

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,140
successful the kids gave me great

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,100
feedback they said at last it finally

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,630
feels like we're actually writing

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,580
programs and we know how to run them and

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,980
we can make our programs do things Corey

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,240
asked well my fake virus program how do

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,960
I get that on someone else's computer

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,810
and make it

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,970
make it run when they log in you know I

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,470
think he said terrible things like a

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:31,180
hard drive is being deleted and we're

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:32,590
tracking you and things like that and we

00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,450
could get into discussions about

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,420
real-world issues about security and

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,220
about where to keep your files in your

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,360
computer well what if you keep them in

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,370
the wrong place you can lose your files

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,040
and so on how the computer actually

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:50,620
works right and that's the picture the

00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,850
graduation for our for a week six Tim to

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,240
coderdojo with all the kids is holding

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,830
up their certificates that was really

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:07,510
good that was a lot of fun i'm looking

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:11,500
forward to 2 m3 and that's it no

00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,970
questions good thank you very much sorry

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,520
for the lack of a five minute warning I

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,750
was in that was paying too much

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,750
attention I've got ahead of time

00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,869
my question would be why do you think

00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,979
it's only children who need to have this

00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:28,779
sort of stuff when they're learning

00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:31,899
python how's that else wouldn't have

00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:33,369
minded having that too yeah that's a

00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:36,909
great point I don't think it actually is

00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:39,639
only children I think once once you know

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,219
how to program your extremely biased in

00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:44,109
your approach to teaching it I think

00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:45,459
it's a real problem procrit teaching

00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,489
programming i think is quite different

00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:49,779
to teaching most other things so until

00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,399
you understand until the kids are

00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:53,289
telling you they don't understand what's

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,099
on the screens where it's you don't

00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:58,629
really understand what the problem is my

00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,499
question is if you had your time again

00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:04,779
would you make a pie charm activity and

00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:08,079
build upon that because I guess my only

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,869
issue is if I give a a student a program

00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,669
like pick a random number they can edit

00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:14,199
the little bits and pieces inside it but

00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:16,539
they don't really they can't really

00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,979
build up from it that basically got a

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:20,769
block that I don't know what the blocks

00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:23,199
made up of so would you use pycharm and

00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:25,539
give some comments here and there within

00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:27,869
the the activity to describe what's

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:30,579
going on or would you continue to use

00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:33,299
functions that already exist and let

00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,299
them play around with it

00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,779
with at this age group I would continue

00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:44,799
to doing what I'm doing now simply

00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:46,839
because it's working so well I think

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,329
introducing the IDE later at some point

00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,039
probably has value definitely real-world

00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,829
value many many people use pycharm to

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,689
develop code but I think working with

00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:58,059
the basic building blocks of files and

00:27:55,689 --> 00:27:59,469
you know the terminal and running your

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,629
program on the command line giving

00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,949
arguments to it making it spit out other

00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:05,979
stuff that goes I think that that has

00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:08,379
real value because it because does

00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:09,669
something real and when the kids decide

00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:11,229
that they want to change a piece of code

00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:12,999
to do something else from what it's

00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:16,019
currently doing that I think they're

00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:18,219
learning they're absolutely learning and

00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:19,749
any bits of the language that they need

00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:21,519
to take on board in order to accomplish

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:23,919
what they're doing is part of that

00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,349
process I think the desire to get

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,719
something had to happen is it struck a

00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:31,229
stronger than their desire to learn bits

00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,229
of the language

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,410
do you think it's a good idea to add to

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,809
your curriculum the concept of

00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,490
reusability so maybe in the future when

00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:45,230
they advance a bit more you show them

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,169
existing scripts and the beauty of

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:51,710
actually using an existing script rather

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:54,039
than you know because this would the

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,090
teaching programming and learning it the

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,710
assumption would be I have to create

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,200
everything whenever I needed to do a

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,419
task but adding this concept of

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,330
reusability at early stages do you think

00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:08,300
could be useful as well give

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,490
I could not say no to that I think I

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,890
think this the only right answer is

00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:18,290
there is yes what I've shown you is

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,760
desperation right if I had more time if

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,110
I had training probably I might have

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,340
structured it differently i think other

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,830
people who spoke today have much

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,800
stronger framework for how to teach and

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,540
how to teach these things I saw

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,160
definitely an approach that does not

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:36,700
work and I did that and that was my

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,930
fault but but yes absolutely I think I

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,590
looked for something that worked at all

00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:45,470
right and very short complete programs

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,860
seems to work that seems to work and be

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,230
really good and I think we can grow from

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,760
here as the as the kids decide what they

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,230
want to do now with the code once I

00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,420
start getting an idea about what they

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,060
can manipulate I think those things will

00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,640
come in if I see they're copying the

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,350
same function / / I can tell well that

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,760
looks similar maybe you should just make

00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,440
it one function you can just change it

00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,300
on the argument it looks like this you

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,340
call it give them I think that will

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,130
develop naturally at the moment that

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,770
this is just the you know times of

00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:22,750
desperation to try and find a way to get

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:22,750
them writing Python at all at the back

00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:29,149
the one at the back um um so firstly all

00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,639
of the things that you said about the

00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:34,279
notes in these teaching tools how they

00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:35,690
use terminology too much instead of

00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,440
explaining things using simpler terms

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,029
how the examples are not the variable

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,009
names of very poorly chosen and stuff I

00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:45,169
absolutely agree with all of that um

00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,419
this is I've been the process of

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:49,549
rewriting a chunk of the groc notes and

00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,349
I've been seeing cases of that and

00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,089
fixing them as I go so absolutely agree

00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:56,690
with you on that my question is as

00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:58,219
you're doing command line python how

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,440
much time do you need to spend with the

00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:04,849
kids teaching them how to use a command

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,440
line Oh Minister running programs which

00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:08,389
take arguments on the command line is

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,469
that so two minutes they pick up that

00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:13,940
really easily oh yeah open it type that

00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,289
we'd which is surprising to me I thought

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,299
we would spend a longer time to do that

00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,489
I thought changing folders was going to

00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,169
be a really big deal well with CD so

00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:23,629
what couple of minutes is this a normal

00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:25,339
Linux command line like windows all the

00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:29,329
windows command front windows we have

00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:31,039
maybe two percent max in our class so to

00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:34,099
give you I should have mentioned that so

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,929
in our dojo we have about 30 kids and I

00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:38,389
think that's more or less the same at

00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,729
the other dojos the waitlist is 50 to 60

00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:44,599
kids and there are five dojos in

00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:47,059
Brisbane its enormous wait list to get

00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,839
into these classes what is your boy girl

00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:53,179
ratio very low at my particular dojo I

00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:56,679
think we have two or three girls

00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:58,819
depending on the day to 27 28 boys and

00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,479
none of them none of the mentors are

00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:04,279
women either which which is quite bad I

00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:07,099
would like to change that I'm not sure

00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,769
how to do that perhaps if we had a

00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:12,129
better ratio in in the mentors that that

00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:12,129
might work

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,889
hey so I just wanted to UM speak to you

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:22,010
so last year I did a two-hour workshop

00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:24,320
at OSCON the first kids day and I was

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,230
asked to teach command-line Python and

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,440
now I teach programming to kids and have

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,899
done for many years and use a lot of fat

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,630
at that stage I'd used a lot more

00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:37,190
multimedia tools to do it so it was a

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,799
really big thing for me and they gave me

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,230
this the dev ox guys had already

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:43,820
designed this thing and there was a

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,529
random number generator and there was a

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,510
Fahrenheit to Celsius converter and I

00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:49,010
just threw it out the window I totally

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,559
threw it out the window I'm not going to

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,120
take I've got six to 18 year old kids

00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,919
and you want me to one who the hell

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,570
cares about celsius to fahrenheit i'm

00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,120
teaching American kids like they care

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,639
out like any kid cares at that edge and

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,710
also random number generator great but

00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,450
what is its real world application so

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,950
what I did was I kind of went how did I

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,830
learn to code I learned to code by

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,320
writing games on the command line so

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,760
what we did was what I did was take the

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,769
way and they were teaching the basics

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,409
but I took it in each of it we kind of

00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:20,419
created a turn-based game and this is

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,429
all up on github as well we created a

00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:23,809
turn-based game and then each kind of

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:26,029
step we would go through we were

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,559
learning a different sets of weather

00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,480
here we're learning strings then we're

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,740
learning to pull in integers etc and we

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,720
get to the point where we actually pull

00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,029
in a random number generator when we

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,250
want to add a dice so we're not just

00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:40,730
saying one two three but are actually

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,830
rolling that dice the response I got

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,570
from the kids is in two hours the

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,950
response I got from the kids was amazing

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,929
because at the end of it I've gone now

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,370
here's this and it was a you know Game

00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:52,639
of Thrones is pretty popular so it was

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,289
at okay this is a dragon slaying game

00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,149
and then I went now go off and now that

00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:58,159
you've got this I want your hack this

00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:00,559
coat and make it into your own stories I

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,409
had this like there was just it was

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,640
amazing i had about 15 or so kids that

00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,500
were just like

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,750
see what I had come and see if I hacked

00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,399
you know and it was and I just kind of

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,409
blew my mind away because for me it was

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,750
really oh my god how the hell am I going

00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:18,110
to teach kids command line in new year

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:20,390
2014 and they loved it and you know we

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,580
forget like because we're out we forget

00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:25,010
that's how we learn and we also forget

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,830
that the power of actually seeing the

00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,610
computer talk to you as well because

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,790
that's what you're doing in a

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,290
command-line game so I find doing that

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,270
doing the command line Python you know I

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,149
found taking that game approach a lot

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,360
easier because a lot of us yeah a lot of

00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,340
the structures out there just really use

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,440
random things that just make nothing and

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,590
you really need to pull it into meaning

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,390
for the kids to see that and I've had a

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,470
couple of them when I didn't do kids day

00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,669
this year but when I was that I was

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,100
kinda actually had a couple of parents

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:57,950
come up to me and go oh my child has

00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:01,460
kept on doing that work and etc which

00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:04,490
was quite nice to hear have you thought

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,020
of you know taking that approach and

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,240
regards to like pulling in it I just

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,460
find gaining teaching kids anything in

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,760
regards to games gets them interested I

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,880
would be very interested in that github

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,880
account

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,320
cool thank you caleb

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,250
