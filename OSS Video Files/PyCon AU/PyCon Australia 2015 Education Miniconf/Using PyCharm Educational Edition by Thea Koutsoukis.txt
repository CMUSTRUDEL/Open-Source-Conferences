Title: Using PyCharm Educational Edition by Thea Koutsoukis
Publication date: 2015-08-06
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Education Miniconf
Description: 
	Late last year, JetBrains released a new version of their PyCharm IDE - the Educational Edition. This version has an integrated Python console, Debugger and Version Control System, along with educational features like the ability to create and deliver "fill in the missing code" exercises.
This talk highlights my experiences using PyCharm Lessons to teach beginners Python. 
As a fairly new piece of software, there are a number of bugs that can cause a lot of pain when first starting out. This talk will demonstrate the steps to creating lessons and tests, publishing them and sharing them with students, while avoiding problems with the system. 
I will also share thoughts on using an IDE with beginners, how students have reacted and what kind of lessons have been successful.


PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

all right hi everyone welcome back from

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,840
morning tea I hope it was nice I I was

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,460
too nervous to eat anything so can I

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,000
just get a show of hands how many people

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,630
here actually teaches Oh fantastic this

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,939
seems to be okay so hi osya this is my

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,860
first conference talk so I apologize in

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,860
advance for talking too fast and

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,469
finishing in 15 minutes I was going to

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,110
do a live demo of creating a lesson but

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,940
when I tried in an earlier test my

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,649
computer decided that being both plugged

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,539
into a projector and still having a

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,589
functioning mouse was just too much to

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,370
handle so static slides it is anyway

00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:54,780
about me I'm a recent graduate of

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,089
computer science and artificial

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,649
intelligence I went to university in

00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:01,199
Scotland at the University of Edinburgh

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,510
and I felt really behind when I started

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,720
because unlike all the kids from the UK

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,340
I'd never done programming in school so

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,780
when I came back to Australia even

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,640
though I have no formal teaching

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,730
training I decided to jump headfirst

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,430
into running after-school clubs to teach

00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,290
kids to code and this past two terms

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,600
I've been teaching my year 8 students

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,940
Python the main tool I've been using is

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,700
the PyCharm educational addition by

00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,870
JetBrains

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,210
so what's this talk about there's been a

00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,100
lot said on the subject of teaching

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,230
people how to program there have been

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,240
some great talks and articles on what

00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,820
language you should use why it should be

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,790
Python the sorts of material you should

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,220
be teaching but this is a talk for when

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,260
you finish doing that you've decided you

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,910
want your kids to know Python you want

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,390
them to learn about data types and

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,210
variables functions loops but I know

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,060
personally none of that was the hard bit

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,980
there's so much material material out

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,210
there so many lesson plans and project

00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,989
ideas what was hard was how should I set

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,400
up a programming environment for kids

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:15,000
they usually can't access the command

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,950
prompt so when I was younger I wanted to

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,720
be able to program but I was too

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,270
intimidated by what I needed to install

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,240
how to set up my computer nothing worked

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,980
for me straight out of the box I know

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,710
now we're really lucky you to have

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,300
websites you can learn to code out

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,180
they have their limitations and at some

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,040
point you need to install something so

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,640
this is about what I installed software

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,200
I use page time educational so this

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,570
talks about how you can use it to teach

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,940
how you can create your own lessons use

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,830
other people's lessons some of the pros

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,170
and cons to using this particular tool

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,480
as opposed to others it's aimed at

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,620
anyone interested in teaching Python

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,450
whether you're an experienced programmer

00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:01,410
or not I tried not to make it too techie

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,540
okay what is PyCharm it's an IDE which

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,150
is an integrated development environment

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,640
basically software for helping you write

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,310
software it's a tool to help you create

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,890
Python projects that assist you with

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,380
writing compiling and running code it

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,910
has syntax and error highlighting so it

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,370
shows you where you've made mistakes and

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,960
how you might fix them it has code

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,600
completion tools kind of like the

00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,610
predictive text on your phone it has

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,380
version control integration if you want

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,120
to get your students overall it's just

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,250
quite a popular IDE in the Python

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,080
community and it also has a Python

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,400
console which you can use which is

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,650
getting great for getting around those

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,830
school restrictions on using command

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:47,460
prompts the educational edition is all

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,770
that it's completely free it's open

00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,110
source it's available for Windows Mac

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,930
and Linux and it has additional tools

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,450
for educators namely there are two new

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,850
types of projects one for creating and

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,440
one for taking fill in the missing code

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:07,080
type exercises so how to get started

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,540
with page time educational you can get

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,220
your lovely IT staff to install Python

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,960
2.7 or 3.4 and the pycharm educational

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,270
edition on school computers or student

00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,400
laptops in fact I'm pretty sure with the

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,730
Windows version of pycharm it actually

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,350
installs Python for you so if it's on

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:29,670
kids or in laptops it's pretty much a

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,040
one-click install it's very easy second

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,210
of all if you will be writing your own

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,669
lessons

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,780
you have to open PyCharm on your

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:42,120
computer go to the settings plugins and

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,949
tick course creator for pay charm

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,650
educational for some reason that's off

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,620
by default and with that you're actually

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,250
all ready to go so there are two types

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,169
of projects you can create with students

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,770
educational and pure Python so let's

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,060
look at educational best this is what it

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,940
looks like from the students point of

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,580
view that you create a new project

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,110
it's like educational choose what

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,750
version of Python they're going to be

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,360
using and then they have the option of

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,919
selecting what course to take the course

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,479
is in the drop-down menu are ones that

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,150
have been created by other people and

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,599
uploaded to the official JetBrains git

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,870
repository currently there's a beginners

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:27,479
course one on logging on ciphers and on

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,979
unit testing as you can see there aren't

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,479
really too many that are actually

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,819
published on the official one there are

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,199
more floating around the web

00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,210
but yeah it's a fairly new piece of

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,099
software but jetbrains are trying to

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,449
encourage people to create courses by

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:44,460
running competitions one recently ended

00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,889
alternatively you can click those three

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,409
little dots next to it and select a

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,090
course from a file so if you create a

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:55,139
course you can put it on the student

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,419
drive and they can access it alright so

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,599
say we've decided to do the course on

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:04,110
logging I was gonna take you through the

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,419
interface so the top left we have a list

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,280
of all the lessons in this particular

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:12,690
course and the tasks in each lesson

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,900
below that's a description of the course

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,669
and a progress bar one of my main graves

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,979
for this software is it's it's a little

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:25,169
squished but you actually can hide most

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:27,630
windows so on the top right we have the

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,949
task text this gives us information what

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,349
do we need to do to complete this

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:34,080
particular task any functions we might

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,050
need to use and note that by clicking

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,030
that little arrow next to task text it

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,860
hides it I took way too long to figure

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,479
that out and kept complaining when the

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,090
text was too long and I couldn't see any

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,219
of the code and I felt really

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,430
but yes below that is the code that we

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,669
need to edit so see the blue boxes that

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,409
tells us which bits we need to change

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,300
you can click on any of those blue boxes

00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,069
and click on the light bulb and it gives

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,969
you a hint about what you need to do in

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,530
that particular bit okay so we've

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:07,080
finished replacing the highlighted text

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,680
with our answers and you click the tick

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,360
button to run and check our food

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,539
congratulations you click the arrow to

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,879
the next task and as you can see our

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:21,300
progress bar has gone up it's very

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:24,210
exciting and kids go mad for it

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,819
I made a course and I accidentally made

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,379
an error in one of the testing files so

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,060
no one could get it to pass the test

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,039
even though they had the answer I was

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,340
looking for you would have thought I'd

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,050
just like killed their dog or something

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,789
not that devastating maybe but they were

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,039
really annoyed that they couldn't get a

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,580
perfect progress bar somehow very

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,590
motivating okay so everything's going

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,319
along fine then you run it and you've

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,270
got an error if you don't get it right

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,490
it gives you a hint for what you need to

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,610
change and highlights the boxes that

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,710
you've gotten wrong what I love about

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,229
this system is that it enables kids to

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,940
go at their own pace so one of the

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:05,279
issues I found with teaching after

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,710
school clubs is that every student comes

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,389
in at a different level so instead of

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,789
leaving half the kids bored and the

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,069
other half lost they work through what

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,990
they can ask for additional help when

00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,379
they need it and I don't have to check

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,689
every single one of their answers it

00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,310
also reveals areas where everyone

00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:25,289
doesn't quite get it usually when I

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,300
haven't explained things very well and

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:29,129
then I can go over it with the whole

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,000
class maybe write an extra lesson on it

00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:36,169
next week so now we get to the exciting

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,180
bit which is making your own lessons I

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,909
realize a lot of teachers probably won't

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,120
have time to do this it takes me the

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,500
better part of a weekend but that's not

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,860
it's not such a bad thing to do it

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,860
anyway

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,850
once you have made a few courses you

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,250
know it gets easier and then you can

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,740
reuse them and I highly recommend it I

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,980
have so much fun writing terrible jokes

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,530
for the kids to not get in my in my

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:08,230
courses so yes he gave it and give it a

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:11,860
name a description and your set so here

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,790
is one I made earlier lesson we did on

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,950
the string datatype so projects as we

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,010
saw in the student setting are divided

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,070
into lessons and tasks so in this

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,680
particular one I have four lessons one

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,970
on creating strings on finding and

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,840
changing things in strings

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,600
on splitting and stripping and on

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,440
testing things about strings the first

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,230
lesson has six tasks and each task has

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,460
an answer file an HTML file for the text

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,710
and a test file so here I hate to shout

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,380
but I must stress now if you are writing

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,290
lessons plan them out before you make

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,600
them pay charm educational currently

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,300
does not support refactoring of files

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,850
you can't change the order lessons in

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,740
without manually going into each file

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,170
and copying and pasting it into another

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,310
one and try not to delete lessons it

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,010
screws things up

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,630
it's a massive pain and it's one I

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,920
really hope that they're going to fix in

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,140
the next version well that's what they

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,790
promised anyway and you might think

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,380
you'll be tricky and just go into your

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,320
file system and swap them over

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,160
no doesn't like it I don't know why but

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,620
there you go plan your lessons anyway so

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,660
we've got the answer file this is where

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,910
you write the code that the students

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,990
will see but you write in the answers

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,650
too you highlight anything you want the

00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,980
students to change and add a placeholder

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:43,270
and add the placeholder text so the

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,330
students will just see you're adding

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,740
that and there if they click on the hint

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,450
it will tell them that strings need

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,440
quotation marks around them because I

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,070
found that's

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,740
most common error so make sure you've

00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,290
finished you write your whole file and

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,420
then add the placeholders otherwise this

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,560
happens you can't go to the next line

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,670
because you're just stuck in a

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,180
placeholder forever it's really annoying

00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:12,870
okay so in the tasks at HTML file you

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,550
write what you want those kids to read

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,710
hyperlinks bold and breaks are the only

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,590
HTML that really works but I think

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,540
that's plenty also I'm not sure of other

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,120
teachers find this for kids often don't

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,950
even really read what you've written

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,570
anyway they'll skim over it

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,340
they'll skip to the last line where it's

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,840
telling them what to do then get really

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,220
frustrated when they don't know how to

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,850
do it even though it was written in the

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:41,350
second sentence but I digress the tests

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,300
file see on the Left they're bad

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,870
resolution but there's a file called

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,700
test helper that contains all the

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,520
different methods you can use for

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,640
testing you can check what they wrote in

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,070
the placeholder and also what the output

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,660
was when they ran their code just know

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,170
it converts everything just strings

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:05,410
which is kind of annoying but it also

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,450
runs a bunch of common tests which are

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,490
things like did they edit the file is

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,440
the file empty do they just delete all

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,450
the placeholders and when you're done

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,970
right-click the project and generate a

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,350
course archive this is the file that you

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,990
sent a student so it's just one file you

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:29,020
send them to them and they open it as an

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:31,380
educational project alright so what sort

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,900
of lessons does this actually work for

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,170
unfortunately nothing where you want to

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,640
use external file input or keep codes

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,130
students have written from one exercise

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,410
to the next reading and writing to files

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,380
is currently not supported in the

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,290
educational projects the best sort of

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,870
exercises are ones that have a very set

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,540
have a set answer either very specific

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,420
syntax they have to use or a very

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,670
specific output

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,280
then for bigger more complicated

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,380
projects I just use an ordinary project

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,840
in patreon and we work through it as a

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:12,660
class so here are some more examples of

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:16,530
lessons I've made so this particular one

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,570
had two challenges learn how to make a

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,040
computer print the lyrics to 99 bottles

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,270
and make a higher or lower guessing game

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,790
so this is what it looks like

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,370
in the course creator this is a task

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:32,000
where you have very specific syntax so I

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,580
want them to print a list of numbers

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,370
from 1 to 20 and I want them to use the

00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:41,190
range function I want students write

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,180
yeah exactly what I've written and this

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,030
is what it looks like from the student

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:49,650
point of view so all the stuff I wrote

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:53,010
and then kind of empty code to fill in

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:55,490
down the bottom this is another type of

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,920
type of task I like where you have

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:03,140
multiple possible answers so instead I'm

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,900
just testing I'm testing their output

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:10,350
and that's what it looks like the

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,510
students point of view but when you are

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,250
finished with the constraints of lessons

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:16,290
say you want to be able to keep code

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,620
they've written without it being all in

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,620
one big file it's time to use a time to

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,420
move to a pure Python project so that's

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,070
what those look like you've got your

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,220
project structure on the Left code

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,930
editor on the right little green arrow

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,420
button to run you've got a Python

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,940
console down the bottom you can use so

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:42,150
here we were creating a virtual pet

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,650
learning about classes and objects so

00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,700
this is one of the features when you

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,500
type in a variable and a full-stop you

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,970
then get a list of all the methods you

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,110
can use on it which is pretty great

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,600
another thing I love is the error

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,910
highlighting so python in general is

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,430
quite good with their errors I find they

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,890
usually make sense and point to the

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,990
problem at least for me for the kids not

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,700
so much the additional information

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,610
provided by pycharm

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,400
even better so here a student has

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:18,110
forgotten a colon after the if statement

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,880
and we get syntax error invalid syntax

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,730
but if you hover over the screen II read

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,610
line it tells us exactly what's wrong

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,260
colon was expected it also highlights

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,480
things that aren't compliant with path

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,980
eight that's the style guide for Python

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,410
not compulsory but it makes things

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,060
prettier and I like that because then my

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:40,740
kids have pretty code yes so one

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,410
instance in which this has been really

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,220
helpful I have a student that's dyslexic

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,900
he loves programming wants to make games

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,190
but really struggles because of the

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:55,500
constant syntax errors he gets he always

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,990
you know from one variable to the next

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,520
he'll misspell it every time he has a

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,650
hard time finding where all these

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,530
mistakes are and then we started using

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,070
pycharm now he just types the first few

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,860
letters

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,720
it can autocomplete for him he can pick

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,240
from a list of functions that he knows

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,280
will work and errors are really clearly

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,830
labeled so it's much less painful to him

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,420
I imagine this would also you know work

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:23,850
well for English as a second language

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:26,520
students okay so this is how I use it

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,430
all in practice so I have our long

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,910
classes once a week we start each lesson

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,720
by recapping what we learnt last week

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,110
getting students to answer simple

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,840
questions then I explain whatever new

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,700
topic we're doing today not necessarily

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,680
all the functional functions we'll be

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,440
using but the key ones the ones that I

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,600
find people have most trouble with may

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,690
be how to split a string or loop through

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,370
a list then they'll start working on the

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,590
lesson I've made which usually takes the

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,290
rest of the hour

00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:01,560
the following week we work as a class on

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,660
a big project in pure Python so after

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,000
we've done the lesson on user input next

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,920
week we made a magic 8-ball where

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,130
students could ask a question and it

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,699
would return you know yes no maybe I

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:17,250
don't know the main problem I have with

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,290
this is when top students finish a lot

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,110
earlier than the rest of the class

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,000
in that case I either ask them to help

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,650
their peers or I make them work on this

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
one lesson they made with really hard

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:32,670
maths problems okay so what are the

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,390
alternatives we've got online

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,550
interpreters like labs at code Academy

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,500
and compiled online they have the

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,680
advantage of not having to have anything

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,570
installed on computers if students are

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,460
bringing their own laptops you don't

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,680
have to set up Python and pei-chun for

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,820
every single one you can save your work

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:57,210
as a URL and open it again at home and

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,710
Python anywhere has some educational

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,450
thing that's in beta at the moment so

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,140
I'll be interested to see what they do

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:06,300
with that but the disadvantages are that

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,600
they don't always work for every browser

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,720
because I'm half the kids they have have

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,430
an outdated version of Internet Explorer

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,410
some schools I've been to have shocking

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:20,100
internet connections and kids constantly

00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:23,370
lose their work and they don't have all

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,980
the capabilities that an IDE has so

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,370
using ipython notebooks seems to be very

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,740
popular with universities these days the

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,650
only problem is to start it up you need

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,570
access to command prompt or terminal and

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,340
I haven't been in a school yet that

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,230
gives their students permission to

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,740
access that and probably with good

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,090
reason

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,820
seeing some of the things they get up to

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:48,060
in my last class when we were making the

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,640
virtual pets kids wanted to create a new

00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,860
cryptocurrency called pet coins and then

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,460
make a freemium game we have to buy food

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,780
for your virtual pet in pact coins and

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,730
anyone that wants to make a freemium

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,100
game is kind of a little bit evil in my

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:06,810
books so lastly there are other IDs like

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,750
movie only ones I've tried Idol and

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,660
Eclipse they're similar to pycharm but

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,160
without half of the functionality

00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,169
without all the educational stuff so

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,000
it's not

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:22,360
so why do I like using Python so much

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,010
sum it up it's free it works off line

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,289
it's a complete package that does

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,020
everything you want and most importantly

00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,549
my students really love it when we don't

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,470
have lessons and we just do regular

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,840
projects for a while they complain

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,820
because they they enjoy the lessons so

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,720
much maybe it's maybe it's all the jokes

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,340
I put in I strongly believe that using

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,899
the same tools that experience

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,529
developers use is the best thing for

00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:49,149
students so interactive online

00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:51,279
educational platforms like code Academy

00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,380
they're extremely easy to start with and

00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,029
that's great but as soon as you need to

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,010
make any real projects anything with

00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:00,010
more than one file you lost

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,590
I found PyCharm to be easy enough that

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,419
kids can pick it up quickly and focus on

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,460
learning Python rather than learning the

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:09,549
editor and that's what you want when

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,470
you're learning to program so you can go

00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,390
here to see some of the courses I've

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:18,190
made they're not all up there feel free

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,960
to download and use them from half of it

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,490
probably doesn't make sense but you can

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,289
download the whole thing and edit my

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,179
lessons make them better see how they

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,640
work or you can just download the course

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:32,520
archive and you put on your poor

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,520
students and yeah

00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,230
okay

00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:45,999
so you have questions now and if folks

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,620
can wait for the microphone to capture

00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:52,210
the questions to the recording that are

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:54,370
between hi and so you mentioned earlier

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,929
on something about github and your

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,749
students and unless you have a github

00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,649
account I would be interested to know if

00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:02,230
you're using github

00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:06,850
especially with did you say your rights

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:08,919
yeah he writes where we got it set up

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,840
last week so we haven't actually

00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,779
properly used it yet they've just made

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,070
accounts but it's very easy in Python

00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,499
there's just like a button that says

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:21,100
linked to your github account and then a

00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:21,970
button that says push so what you are

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:28,649
planning to do with it

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:31,570
I guess just teach them how to yeah so

00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:33,759
in the UK what what I'm trying to get

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,019
out a little bit is that we find me

00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,159
teachers but they're using it with their

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,590
students is having like an online

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,480
portfolio of their work and then using

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,700
that to help mark the work because they

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,029
can see the diff oh yes he will change

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,619
yeah that's a good idea so I'm I'm an

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:51,009
after-school thing so it's not it's not

00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:52,629
a graded it's just for fun so I haven't

00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,429
really thought too much about how you

00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:57,659
could use it yeah if you need to great

00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,659
stuff it that would be easy

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,720
just curious how you started your

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,980
after-school program I just rang a bunch

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,570
of schools and asked them if they wanted

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,590
if they wanted to run a coding Club and

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:22,340
this is why I thought it was a good idea

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,340
and why why I'd be okay to do it

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,929
how do you find kids take two just

00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,710
getting text output rather than graphic

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:36,330
cowboy

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,289
so we started with scratch and they all

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,700
really love that

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,610
so I teach primary school and high

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,250
school the primary school kids aren't

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,460
very impressed by the text output so we

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:51,120
we mainly just do scratch because it's

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,460
more exciting but the the older kids the

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,710
high school kids they they say they

00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:01,710
prefer - but you know we could start our

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,220
I don't know not TK inter I don't know

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,820
what we could start doing for this in

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,820
graphical stuff it

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:20,880
say yeah you can you can do turtle yeah

00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,130
we've done some stuffing turtle um so

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,140
when when you're in Brisbane with this

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,560
program correct and it's just at one

00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,730
school though uh the gap Oh like a pair

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,440
of the gap hi Milton and cap state okay

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,790
I was just curious because I tried to

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,190
set up a cutting Club earlier this year

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,500
and had a lot of difficulty so did I I

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,570
rang you know maybe 20 schools and yeah

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,400
three go back to me so and that's only

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,400
because I had connections at all three

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,720
of those schools right I had I had one

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,330
told me that it would be too expensive

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:59,400
even though I said it was free yeah so

00:23:51,330 --> 00:24:02,010
there you go so one of the problems that

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,680
I've seen solved with ipython notebooks

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,000
is and and one of the problems is more

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,240
generally is that of a shared

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,060
environment so if you're teaching I've

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,620
seen this with spark for instance you

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,630
know no one's gonna have pi spark

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,220
installed so you have to go through and

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,770
teach everyone how to install PI spark

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,450
and then how to run it whereas if you've

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,480
got this shared environment you can

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,530
it's already done do you know if the

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,650
educational Edition has the ipython

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:33,960
notebook integration or I don't think it

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,670
does I haven't tried any shared stuff at

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,170
the moment we just work yeah

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,670
individually because I couldn't get

00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:44,600
ipython notebooks running on there yeah

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:48,520
this particular schools computers

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:51,230
um so my question is about the item

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,050
tests and activities yes that you were

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,970
um how prescriptive are they are you act

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,680
like with the the boxes that the the

00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,600
kids have to replace and fill in are you

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,640
testing that they filled it in with

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,730
exactly something or you're testing that

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,520
the card works so it depends on what I

00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,770
want what yeah so for that one where I

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,230
want them to learn how to use range they

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,350
have to it has to say range from one to

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,330
ten but for most of them I am testing

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,770
what output they get so those sort of

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,340
the text output should be this and then

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,340
yes yeah

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:33,480
Hey as so one of the problems I ran into

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,920
trying to teach kids using an IDE that's

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,540
an ID you would almost have too much

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,880
going on there would be too much than

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,920
the interface yeah did you encounter

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,250
that issue with my German so how did you

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,610
work around it um I actually haven't

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,900
experienced that problem yet at first

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,580
class we said yeah

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,020
there are a lot of functions you will

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,120
not need to use anything the ones you

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:59,260
have to look at are the button that says

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,870
play run this is the code editor and

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:07,210
this is how you make a new file and so

00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:09,040
we kind of only looked at that yeah they

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,929
they don't use most of the functionality

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:19,890
of it but then again neither do I when I

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:19,890
use it really cool thank you

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,290
