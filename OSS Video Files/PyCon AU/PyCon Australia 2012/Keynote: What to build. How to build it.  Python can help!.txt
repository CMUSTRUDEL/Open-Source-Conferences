There's been a lot of buzz about "Lean Startups," "Customer Development," "Business Model Generation" and related topics lately. And there is a real transformation in the way we design and build products at work behind all that buzz.

hello okay no longer on mute much better

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,160
hi as you said I'm mark RAM and I'm

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,049
really privileged to be here and talk to

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,210
you guys today so I want to make the

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,320
most of this time and try and tell you

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,960
things that I think are valuable I'm at

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,689
mark ram on twitter if you want to

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,210
provide feedback as I go feel free to

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:34,290
tweet about that or whatever basically

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:38,160
about a year ago I was at a talk by a

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,070
guy named Steve Blank about startups and

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,480
this and that and the other thing and

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,270
most of what he said I have forgotten

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
but sort of three quarters of the way

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,620
through the talk I guess in the question

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,110
and answer quite section he's talking

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,480
about writing 100-page business plan

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,760
documents uh and he said something that

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,219
stuck with me not that I was writing

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,840
100-page business planning documents but

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,420
this sends stuck with me he said your

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,250
heart has only so many beats why are you

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,490
wasting your time on that and I

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,540
think that's a very important question

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,030
it's a good question to ask yourself

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,890
sort of at any given time about whatever

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,250
 you happen to be wasting your time

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,869
on and it might be hundred page business

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,479
plan documents but it might be just

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,650
writing software that people aren't ever

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,950
going to use so basically I want to talk

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,170
about how not to waste your life wasting

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,390
your life is really annoying because you

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,369
only got one of them and when it's done

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,369
it's done so don't waste your life

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,250
according to the internet nine out of

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,820
ten IT projects fail and nine out of 10

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,049
startups fail according to Theodore

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,869
sturgeon who was a science fiction

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:02,780
writer ninety percent of everything is

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,950
 so it kind of makes sense I guess

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,570
he actually said that somebody said hey

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,000
I read a science fiction novel and it

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,039
was crap and his response was well of

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,940
course ninety percent of everything is

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,060


00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,170
so I wanted to talk a little bit about

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,120
well let me I'm ahead of myself there

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,040
are two different kinds of things that

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,980
could be a total waste of your time in

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,720
terms of and now I'm talking to you guys

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,690
as Python software developers how many

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,120
people here develop things in Python

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,550
okay i'm going to ask several questions

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,680
probably lots of you will answer raise

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,220
your hand how many people write code for

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,170
other people to use okay lots of hands

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,700
still how many people write codes for

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,960
other people outside of your

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,670
organization to use okay so less but

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,760
still a lot I'm going to call that kind

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,380
of thing products it doesn't necessarily

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,910
mean you sell them for money but their

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,830
products that people somewhere else is

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:05,260
going to use nine out of ten projects

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,750
fail some projects fail because of

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,610
technical reasons how many people have

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,470
been in a software project that failed

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,190
because people did bad things

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:19,360
technically okay so like just me and

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,430
like 30 other people how many people

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,770
have been on projects that failed

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,370
because well you built it and then it

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:31,330
turned out to be a bad idea okay so

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:34,330
slightly more people how many people

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:38,709
built it and it was crap and it was a

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:44,080
bad idea okay I've done this so you know

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:45,790
don't feel bad if that's you so nine out

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,700
of ten projects fail most of them

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,390
actually like this is a made-up number

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,910
like the internet is crazy probably it's

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,360
more like half like if you look at real

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,970
statistics but half is pretty awful like

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,730
the idea that half of you half of the

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,670
time well half of you all the time are

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:10,090
all of you half the time whatever

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,819
a bunch of you people bunch of me all of

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,720
us spend our time failing like that

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,150
sucks let's not do that so there's two

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,639
different ways that projects fail which

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,220
I already sort of alluded to one you

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,169
screw up like your Python developer you

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,020
like you know what's going to be great

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,760
is if I have instead of using Python

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,650
let's just have everything written in

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,930
like i'm going to use python as an

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,419
interpreter for xml programming language

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,889
that I made up myself like if you make

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:44,680
that kind of decision then bad things

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:47,200
are going to happen I mean I can't

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,419
guarantee bad things but the chances are

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,580
very good so the point being we can make

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,229
technical mistakes technical mistakes

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,130
can cause problems like we could choose

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,320
bad technology I once worked on a

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,990
project where everything was using

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,990
people people is the business process

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:14,260
execution language it is in fact a

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:16,690
programming language written in XML so

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,300
that project did not do well technically

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,450
and also it built we built something

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,800
that nobody wanted so it failed for both

00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,120
reasons it was awesome does my sort of

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,280
first big project as a full-time

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,330
software developer after I'd moved out

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,970
of being system and network

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:39,700
administrator that's like yay I get to

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:42,310
be a programmer yay I get to fail so I

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,910
like to not fail so this whole talk is

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,229
about helping you guys not fail but the

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,180
kind of failure I just talked about

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,380
technical failure I'm not even going to

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,060
talk to you guys about that at all

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,479
that's what the whole rest of this

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,479
conference is about like not

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,310
not teaching you how to fail technically

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,810
ideally those talks will not be about

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,300
that I can't I haven't seen them yet

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,780
they're not to happen but mostly they

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,860
will teach you how not to fail I hope

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,990
but I'm going to teach you about the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,140
other kind of failure which is building

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,370
stuff nobody wants and we'll talk a

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,120
little bit about technical failure along

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,430
the way maybe but so I've built a lot of

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,930
products over the last few years I did

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,120
some consulting I worked for some

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,760
companies I had worked on a bunch of

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,160
products all those products had someone

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,660
who was like a product manager those

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,030
product managers went out and they did

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,310
market research and they figured out

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,470
what we should build because then like

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,060
lots of people will buy the right a

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,240
lot of them did market research some of

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:56,400
them did not do marketing research they

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,030
just pulled stuff out of there but which

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:05,130
one of those people one who did better

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:09,110
anybody the correct answer is it's a

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:14,150
trick question in both both of them suck

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:17,310
and mostly they resulted in failure so

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:21,300
like I had this epiphany sometime I

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,030
don't know like I got suckered into

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,240
about two years ago into becoming a

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,580
product manager and mainly the way that

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,070
happened is I was development lead on a

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,710
project and we kept building stuff and

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,290
we build stuff and then nobody wanted it

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,000
and we're like oh that sucks and then we

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,040
do something else and then nobody would

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,020
want it or then we do something and we

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,310
get halfway through and then like the

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,130
product management people would be like

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,180
oh maybe we should do this so we change

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,980
our mind and do that and then we'd get

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,300
halfway through that into this and like

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,400
we weren't getting anything done and it

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,010
was terrible and I'm like I am totally

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,300
wasting my life this sucks and so are

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:04,110
all the other developers that work with

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:07,140
me and then thank goodness we had an

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,300
event this was at sourceforge I'm

00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,320
probably telling stories out of school

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,510
but

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,750
public information this dude bought

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,730
thirty percent of the company like got

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,550
rid of four people on the board got rid

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,670
of every senior manager person like

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,860
everybody vp level or above she all gone

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,050
the entire product management team

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,760
except one guy who'd been out of college

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:34,800
for like four weeks all of them got laid

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,210
off and so there was a bunch of job

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,349
opening and i was like man they're going

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,450
to hire some new people and they're

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,580
going to be even less clued in than the

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,910
last set of people because they've been

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,950
here for no time so like I took the job

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:53,400
just so that it wouldn't get taken by

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,590
somebody who was really awful and then

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,730
like I could provide some shields of the

00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,550
developers and they could actually get

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,560
something done this is my theory but

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,410
then I had this job and I had to do it

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,120
and I didn't really like the choice of

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,750
like going out and doing market research

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,820
and being wrong or making stuff up and

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,930
being wrong like I wanted to be right

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,600
and this is like crazy thoughts so I was

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,940
like how can we do this let's try to

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,630
apply the principles of science to

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:28,040
product management so I came up with

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,990
this phrase test-driven management and

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,820
my basic thinking here is like okay I've

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,280
been a developer for a long time when

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,290
you have tests you know you're making

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,320
progress when you don't have tests

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,880
you're just doing like who knows

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,950
whether it's better or not who knows

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,290
whether it works or not like you got no

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,660
tests you're writing code that doesn't

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,640
mean you're makin progress right so I

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,970
was like hey what if I try to use this

00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:00,480
idea that tests equal progress as a

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,130
manager not just as a developer so one

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,240
of the things that we did was at

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,130
sourceforge is we started out the first

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,660
thing I did very very first thing i did

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,160
when i started working on sourceforge is

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,050
I was given task to redesign or

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,330
implement a redesign of the project

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,980
summary page so here's angry ip scanner

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,590
it's got a description it's got a

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,170
screenshot and now it's got a big

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,570
download button before this no big green

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,010
download button just that like click to

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,500
view all files and then it'd be this

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,850
list of all the files that had ever been

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,250
released for this project need to have

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,610
to find it and download it so we added

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,600
the green download button it made things

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,970
better people liked it it worked so then

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,770
like a year and a half later we

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,250
redesigned everything to look like this

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,780
bottom one it's got angry ip scanner

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,420
it's got the description the screen shot

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:57,270
at the bottom like the less it's sort of

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:01,080
like a clearer like little nine by nine

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:04,860
grid of information and then eventually

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,810
we redesigned it this way so of these

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,810
three which one is the best who thinks

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,020
the first one is the best who thinks the

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,350
second one is the best okay one person

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,600
who thinks the third one is the best

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,220
okay so I'm going to tell you the first

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,100
one was better than the one that came

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,860
before but it is not the best the second

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,530
one was not as good as the first one and

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:33,900
the third one was better how do I know

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:36,180
this because I ran tests like that is

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,010
how I know empirically like you can say

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,340
visually one looks better than the other

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,500
like which one like seems easier to see

00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,440
but when you actually put these things

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,350
in front of users and run tests you can

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,220
see which people get the file they want

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:56,090
more often and it turns out that going

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,800
from this one to this one there was a

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,900
something like twenty percent increase

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,320
in the number of people who get the file

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,760
that they want now there's reasons for

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,300
this and I'm going to talk about those

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,460
in a little bit but we did test and we

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,960
found out that people click the download

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,300
button they find the download they want

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,180
more often with this page than they did

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,520
with the one that came before what is

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,170
really crazy is the first two times we

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,880
did this we didn't test we didn't know

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,280
what was better we didn't know if things

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,080
were getting better or worse we had like

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,730
people they're making designs we're

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,760
pushing them we don't know what's

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:36,390
working what's not working so my

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,050
fundamental assertion

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,530
in terms of deciding what to do what

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,610
features to add how to build products is

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,040
tests or how you know you're making

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,190
progress if you don't have tests you

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,050
don't know that's just the way it

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,970
is like developers figure this out a

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,380
long time ago I mean if you haven't

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,090
figured this out in the development side

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:02,160
then maybe you're looking toward the

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:05,550
first kind of project failure but on the

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,440
product side this is still true but what

00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:14,700
what do I mean by tests in this case I

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,470
mean experiments so anybody like I'm

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
going to talk about science I'm talking

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,190
about scientific product management

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:27,120
anybody like wanna explain how science

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:31,550
works somebody this guy he does okay

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,550
someone else he dines what is it and

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,790
skeptically querying the world to see

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:43,920
how it works how's that that's them oh

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:46,740
he's got a gift guy say give a shot I

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,690
say formulate the hypothesis and design

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,320
an experiment to test the hypothesis

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,510
that is a good question good both of

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,280
those are important so I'm going to talk

00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,360
about both of those things actually

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:02,790
there are key things so my question was

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,500
what if product managers documented

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,210
their assumptions what if product

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,740
managers work with a team to learn about

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,230
what works and what doesn't work and

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,170
what if product manager didn't just make

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,600
 up like what kind of a world would

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,910
that be and my assertion is it would be

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,040
a better world so here's like a very

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,260
simplified version of the scientific

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,730
method you ask a question you might go

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,170
out and do some background research and

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,300
say you know like have other people

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,130
asked this question like did they get an

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,770
answer did they do some experiments

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,910
what's happened so far like if you don't

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,980
do that part you don't know what

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,230
electricity is then you could do

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,240
research but you probably end up like

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,130
Ben Franklin putting the kite up in the

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,200
sky and electrocuting the crap out of

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,920
yourself instead of getting some good

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,320
results not to say

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,970
thinks about Ben Franklin but you know

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,079
if you did that experiment now it's

00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:00,060
because you're stupid construct a

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,579
hypothesis so you want to say like this

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,470
is the way I think things work and then

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,290
you want to test your hypothesis by

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,269
doing an experiment then you want to

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,690
analyze your data draw a conclusion and

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,240
report your results now what if you did

00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,510
this sort of thing in product management

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:22,380
what if you said hey like I think people

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,149
are going to like this second version

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,519
better than the first version because

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:30,440
it's a lot simpler it's a lot less

00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,839
clutter it's very obvious what you click

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,490
like it doesn't have this big weird

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,829
whatever that divider bar at the top is

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,019
like that looks weird like I don't like

00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,730
it like I think the second one is just

00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,769
cleaner like people will like it better

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,510
so you could make this assertion then

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:50,790
you say well let me do a test do people

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,139
like it better but better would be like

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,779
I think people will like this better

00:15:52,139 --> 00:16:00,029
because x y&z and tess x y&z the more

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,470
detailed your assertion can be the more

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,300
you can test out of it you can say

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,680
people will like this better because

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,079
this download button with the

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,209
sourceforge logo is more obvious than

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,730
that download button which has no logo

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:15,079
like they can understand the difference

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:17,279
between these download buttons or

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,440
whatever your assertion is and then you

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,640
can test just that one little piece you

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,829
don't have to test a whole page

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,480
redesigned to figure out which of those

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:31,410
things is better whether your assumption

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,970
is right so you construct a hypothesis

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,819
you test your hypothesis by doing

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,699
experiment this there's an important

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:40,260
thing here Karl Popper who's a

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,660
philosopher of science among other

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,029
things came up with the idea of

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,510
falsifiability science doesn't prove

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,819
that something is true but it doesn't do

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,500
anything unless you state a hypothesis

00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:54,750
that is falsifiable that there's some

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,300
way to do an experiment when you do that

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,920
experiment you could figure out that you

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,300
are wrong it's not so much about

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,040
figuring out that you're right as

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,710
figuring out that you're not wrong yet

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,830
here's a Karl Popper quote actually he's

00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:13,200
talking about science and history but he

00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,970
says we both start from myths from

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,220
traditional prejudice the set with error

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,730
and from these we proceed by criticism

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,880
by the critical elimination of error so

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,760
back to your point the role of evidence

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,620
in the main is to correct our mistakes

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,810
our prejudices are tentative theories

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,760
that is to play a part in the critical

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,620
discussion in the elimination of error

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,890
so the point here is not that you're

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,050
ever going to find the truth necessarily

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,540
you may not know exactly what people

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,990
want like if people are weird and we'll

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,150
get to people are weird in a second but

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,010
you may not ever find the exact nature

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,380
of what people want what you're going to

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,330
find is what people don't want that your

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,210
assumptions about what people want or

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,550
thought were wrong and having the

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,370
ability to go to evidence and make those

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,850
decisions is a lot better if I go back

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:08,970
to this there were huge arguments huge

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,950
arguments by people at sourceforge about

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,830
which of these things was better certain

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,910
people worked really hard on the first

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,800
one and thought the second one was

00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,060
terrible other people designed the

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,920
second one and thought the first one was

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,710
terrible people thought the third one

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,100
was not any better like different people

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,110
had different opinions arguing about

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,780
your opinion about which is better is

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,780
annoying and stupid and a waste of time

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,510
do not spend your life on that do a

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,390
test get some evidence make some

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,730
decisions based on actual evidence then

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,690
like it's not you like I'm not the

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,280
product manager being like hey like this

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,050
like I'm not saying like not that I

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,790
thought this but say I was a product

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:54,060
manager I could say that is ugly and I

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,100
hate it this is way more pretty and this

00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,140
is what we should do if I am as product

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,220
manager making these decisions then

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,640
people are going to be pissed at me

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,830
because I'm just arbitrarily sayin stuff

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,440
and they don't believe me whether I'm

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,020
right or not makes no difference like I

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,450
haven't if I'm not relying on data on

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,450
facts then how do they know

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:25,580
so what kind of tests I went too far do

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,180
we want to run so I stole this from dave

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,580
McClure so I didn't make up our but this

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,040
is nice and easy to remember this is

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:38,480
metrics for pirates and can everybody

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:41,350
say the acronym here are so the kind of

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,760
things that you want to measure r and ok

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,890
but are okay before I go into this like

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,220
I'm just going to admit like I'm a web

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,810
person it's like 2012 I assume most

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,910
people are doing web things or things

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,670
that are connected to the web so a lot

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,860
of how you measure this that i'm going

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,630
to describe I'm talking about web stuff

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,820
that doesn't mean you can't do it if

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,980
you're not doing the web but you know if

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,640
you're not doing the web I don't know

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:15,860
like maybe it's 2008 for you or 1998 or

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,750
1988 I don't know but like you're gonna

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,250
have to translate in your own minds or

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,980
come up to me afterwards and ask me

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,510
questions because I just don't even know

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,420
how to think in the not web world

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:30,770
anymore unfortunately the Internet has

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:32,900
invaded my brain so the first kind of

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,540
metric and I'm not going to talk in a

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,940
lot of detail about all these this

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,610
slides I'll put up you can also look up

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,650
dave mcclure presentation on this but

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,780
acquisition how do you get users into

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,700
your site and whether your site is like

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,620
a web application or it's just a site

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,800
that sells the thing that you do offline

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,140
like all of this is still true you want

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,730
to try and get people from search engine

00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,520
optimization or search engine marketing

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,670
or social networks or widgets that you

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,610
install in facebook or whatever PR

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,320
campaigns television ads whatever way

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,840
you're trying to get people in to your

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,690
site you want to measure this stuff like

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,730
not measuring this means you don't know

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,790
what works at all and if you're not

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,370
actually successfully getting users in

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,320
like if you don't have something that

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,049
people want and will come to and look at

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,820
then like building

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,119
next step is which is the actual thing

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,429
is kind of not valuable and you can test

00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,080
this before you build the product you

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,970
can build a website with the homepage

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,679
that says hey wouldn't it be awesome if

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,190
I could solve all of your problems with

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,110
hemorrhoids by blah blah blah and if you

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,090
advertise it and people are like yes I

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,480
have hemorrhoid problems and I would

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,100
totally pay to have them fixed then you

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,340
know that maybe your hemorrhoid your

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,119
miracle hemorrhoid cure website I don't

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,379
know how you're going to write a web

00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,999
application to cure hemorrhoids but some

00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,859
of you all probably can do it because

00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:03,489
you're way smarter than me you're like

00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:05,169
dude I got it but if you if you write a

00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,720
web application cured hemorrhoids you

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:09,999
can see like okay people would buy this

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,059
or they would at least be interesting

00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:14,080
right so you can start measuring

00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:18,580
activation before you even build the

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,070
product or that was acquisition now

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,230
activation activation is ok they come to

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,989
their they get to your hemorrhoid cure

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,659
miracle website and then they're like

00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:30,789
yes by the hemorrhoid cure I have

00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,330
hemorrhoids they hurt right now please

00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:36,429
fix them i will pay ten dollars i

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,929
totally would pay ten dollars and you

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:42,509
could even test prices like i would pay

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:45,309
a hundred dollars like dang hemorrhoids

00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,379
however like whatever the thing is like

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,179
you figure out like do they click the

00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:52,450
button that says that they would

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:55,210
actually become a buyer then retention

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,409
retention really works for web

00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,059
applications if it's hemorrhoid

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,159
medication i guess you want to know if

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:02,080
they're keep signing up like if they

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,639
keep getting new shipments every month

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,009
great if they're like hey it didn't work

00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:10,659
and they hate you then they're not going

00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:12,009
to buy more you're not going to keep

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,159
selling it it's not going to work great

00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:17,230
referrals like would people recommend

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,059
this the there's a metric called the net

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,600
promoter score which is really useful

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:24,940
because people do not want to recommend

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,429
your product if it's like if

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,749
they're like hey that is crap they're

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,879
not going to tell their friends go get

00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:33,460
this crap because it makes them look bad

00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:35,889
and people do not want to look bad so

00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,740
this like they might not tell you if you

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:39,260
go up when you be like

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,510
is my product crap they might be like no

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,300
it's great we love you but they think

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,770
it's crap they're just being nice but

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,510
they're not going to be so nice that

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,610
they tell your friends that you're crap

00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,620
product is good because their friends

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,990
are going to hate them and they don't

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,040
want that so they might lie to you but

00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:01,880
they're not going to lie to their

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:03,380
friends mean anyway so they're not going

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,120
to refer your crap product to their

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,559
friends because that makes their friends

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,700
unhappy it lies to their friends in a

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,820
way that makes their friends mad at them

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,559
so knowing whether people refer to refer

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,270
your product is actually the best way of

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,240
knowing whether they actually like it or

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,340
not although some people may not refer

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,200
your hemorrhoid website just because

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,020
they're embarrassed about it like I

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,110
don't know so there are other things

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,240
that you could be looking into

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:36,080
hypotheses you could test in various

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,970
ways then you can test like revenue can

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:44,600
will peep are people willing to pay for

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:46,490
your solution etc so next I want to like

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,850
so I talked about all of this as though

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,470
it makes sense and is clear like you

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,870
have a product you're just trying to

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,330
like optimize like how much people will

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,130
do or whether people will buy it or

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,610
figure out a few things about it and

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,220
that's what we might call normal science

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,440
or like normal process but if you're a

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,580
startup there's a lot of questions or

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,030
you don't even know whether it's even

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,550
possible or not like Zappos when Zappos

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,580
started there was a real question at

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,620
least in my mind will people ever buy

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,390
shoes on the internet because the key

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,220
thing about buying shoes is trying them

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:28,670
on and seeing if they are comfortable

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:30,080
because shoes that hurt are no fun that

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,820
most people they're like we're gonna

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,670
sell shoes on the internet and I'm like

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,290
have you guys heard of pets com like

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,170
people won't buy pet food on the

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,750
internet why would they buy shoes

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:44,000
doesn't make sense turns out I am

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,310
totally wrong I'm an idiot people for

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,770
whatever reason are like my pet

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,320
can't buy their food on the internet but

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,990
my feet totally fine with shoes I get

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,990
from the internet like who knows people

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,970
are weird but the zeppos people like

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,640
they could have done what pets com did

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,440
and build warehouses stock them full of

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,110
stuff build this whole order processing

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,970
system build a whole system to sell

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,560
shoes on the internet and then go and

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,290
test whether people will buy shoes on

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,390
the internet that would be dumb that is

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:17,120
not what they did what they did is they

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,040
went out to shoe stores and took

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,180
pictures of shoes that were available

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,800
for sale in shoe stores and then they

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,520
went and they put up a website and said

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,770
hey do you want to buy shoes and when

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,840
people said yes i want to buy shoes they

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,550
went out to the shoe store like there

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,480
was a dude and somebody clicks on the

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,910
button on the internet and the dudes

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,890
like oh and he goes runs he's like i

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,660
bought shoes at the shoe store and then

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,490
he comes and runs to the UPS and he's

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,070
like ha now i put it in there and

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:52,160
there's like just a dude buying shoes at

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:55,400
shoe stores and shipping them it worked

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,260
and they were like people will buy shoes

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,240
on the internet because they don't care

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:05,660
if they hurt they care if they look good

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,690
and i was like like so those people are

00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,730
not me obviously like i do not go out

00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,000
and buy nice high heeled shoes on Zappos

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,370
and but they also figured out like that

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,350
they had to have a return policy that

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,050
made sense and then people would feel a

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,720
lot safer buying shoes and they actually

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,250
like made a huge thing about their

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,680
return policy in their customer service

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,860
to overcome the objection of like what

00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,080
if the shoes don't fit and they figured

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,230
out how to make it all work before they

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,270
spend money which is awesome like

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,770
because then they're not wasting their

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,470
time they don't have hundreds of people

00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:47,840
wasting their lives on something that's

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,610
not going to work so the traditional way

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,230
to build a great product is you start

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,180
with a great idea you build a solid

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,430
implementation you launch with great

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,620
marketing and then you win unless you

00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,809
don't and pets com is

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,470
super prime example but there are

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:07,070
million examples like Apple created the

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,890
Newton it didn't work at all and it was

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:13,700
probably a great idea I mean everybody

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:15,740
has PDAs now the implementation like it

00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,200
was the best thing around that did that

00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,390
at the time they had a lot of marketing

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,050
they were apple and yet nobody bought

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:26,330
them so it's not just having a great

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,970
idea having a great implementation you

00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:35,540
have to have something that fits with a

00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:38,330
user perceived need at the time so you

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,929
may not win in fact 9 out of 10 startups

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,390
fail that's actually an underestimation

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,870
depends on what you mean by fail but

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:49,490
most of them do not succeed startups

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,400
fail even more often than regular

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,910
companies and I want to bring this back

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,110
to science there's a book does anybody

00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,750
know the structure of scientific

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,640
revolutions all right there's a few

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,940
people who know about this book does

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,700
anybody know the phrase paradigm shift

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,250
okay paradigm shift comes from this book

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,070
the fact that marketing droids and other

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,780
crazy people said paradigm shift like a

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,480
thousand more times than they should

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,250
have said it after this book is not this

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,080
book's fault this book is a very good

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:25,400
book I highly recommend it and it talks

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,290
about the difference between normal

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,260
science and scientific revolutions

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:32,270
normal science is like what goes on most

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,820
of the time in science people like hey

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,920
we pretty much except the current

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,929
quantum mechanical theory and we just

00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,670
want to figure out like does the Higgs

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,440
boson particle actually exist it's

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,720
predicted to exist let's do experiment

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,600
to see if it does let's test it like

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,730
it's all good like that is normal

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,700
science it's like we have a theory of

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,040
how everything works let's test the

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,410
edges of that theory and see if the

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,120
pieces all actually do fit and then

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,130
let's come up with oh and they sort of

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,260
only fit a little let's come up with

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:08,330
explanations for why they don't quite

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:09,920
fit that makes sense and sometimes these

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,460
explanations can be weird like if you

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
read Isaac Newton here

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,850
explanations for why the speed of sound

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,970
is exactly the speed that it is and

00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:21,210
those explanations are crazy but they

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,919
seemed not crazy to him they just seem

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:28,649
crazy to us now because we know more

00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:30,539
 and then there's these events that

00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,250
happen in science that he calls

00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,840
scientific revolutions they happen in

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,240
every field of science they happen every

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,990
once in a while where somebody takes the

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,110
whole paradigm the whole set of rules by

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:47,429
which the universe works and says you

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:48,990
know what it was wrong like Newton had

00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,380
this whole theory about how gravity

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:55,890
worked Einstein says and not so much

00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,500
turns out gravity is not what he thought

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:00,330
and this formula is what let's think

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,360
what have we thought of gravity as like

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:06,000
sort of bending space-time instead of as

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,580
like a force that like a traditional

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,570
Newtonian explanation of gravity like

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,070
that's crazy thinking but it really all

00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,950
of the data that was currently available

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,230
in a better way and people did it this

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,789
is what startups do when they're doing

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,230
something interesting I mean there's

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,169
lots of startups Ted of like hey I'm

00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,529
gonna you know be like salesforce com

00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:32,539
but for dentists that is not an

00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:35,309
interesting startup that is in any way

00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,720
those startups like there's a book

00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,960
called the Lean Startup it talks about

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,600
optimization versus discovery but it's

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,990
the same difference between normal

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,279
science and scientific revolutions in a

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,370
scientific revolution you're coming up

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,279
with a new system about how people think

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:56,809
and work and what not like that iPhone

00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:02,039
was a revolution in that it put together

00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:03,870
PDA media player all that thing in one

00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,600
device and people actually wanted it

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,039
because it was cool they did something

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,140
that nobody else was doing they did in a

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,480
new way and they found a very large

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,720
audience that's what startups can do

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,730
when they're interesting this comes from

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,649
a guy remember I mentioned I was at a

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,200
Steve Blank talk way back at the

00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:24,140
beginning Steve Blank is my hero he

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,720
wrote a book called the four steps to a

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,940
me in which he described he said let's

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,250
not do product development let's do

00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,260
customer development instead of saying

00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,420
let's develop a product and then see if

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,400
we can get customers said let's get

00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:43,310
customers and then see if we can build

00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:45,620
them or product crazy but it works like

00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,240
and if you do it this way that this part

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,070
where you iterate like can I find

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,110
customers can I find customers who are

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,120
willing to buy this thing oh are they

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,800
really willing to buy it you can iterate

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,080
on that without spending hardly any

00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,530
money and then once you've figured out

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,890
yes like I have a cure for cancer people

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:05,930
will pay me for it then you can build

00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:12,530
the product like now I have to actually

00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:14,570
cure cancer it might be the hard part

00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:17,150
but it might be the easy part like

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,710
sometimes there's a problem that is

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,180
really easy to solve and nobody has

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:26,360
solved it yet because they just didn't

00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:30,950
think of it so going to skip a couple of

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,510
slides so the thing with product

00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,770
development is our customer development

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,800
is you've got to find people who are

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,930
willing to pay sometimes there are

00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,790
different hard problems there's like is

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,710
this product desirable like a cure for

00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,360
cancer you probably don't need a lot

00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,790
spend a lot of time testing is that

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,590
desirable you're pretty sure if you

00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,740
figured it out people would buy that

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:55,400
 is it feasible that is actually

00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,320
hard for curing cancer is it viable will

00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,900
people pay at a rate that makes it

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,990
affordable that depends how feasible it

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,510
is like what you should be doing as a

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,400
product manager or as an engineer who

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,470
cares about product it's figuring out

00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,300
which of these things has the biggest

00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:13,580
risk for the particular thing you're

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,200
working on and solve the riskiest

00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:20,179
problems first if you are ninety percent

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,590
sure that you have a cure for cancer and

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,750
you're just like is there a business

00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,640
model that will work find somebody to

00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,460
help test that if you're like ten

00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,899
percent sure you can cure cancer may be

00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,460
spending a lot of time figuring out

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,280
whether how much people will pay for a

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:41,510
cure of cancer is premature

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:44,120
so I'm going to skip a few like so you

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,640
could say is this product desirable so

00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,580
what this is is it's fake stained

00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:58,130
underwear that you store money in when

00:34:49,580 --> 00:35:00,440
you travel like this is a product idea

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,360
is it a good one is a bad one I don't

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,950
know you might like go through the

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,260
process of trying to discover some

00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,030
customs like is there a problem like yes

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,610
people get their money stolen on travel

00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,930
like here's my proposed product I'm

00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,910
going to get some regular underwear I'm

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,860
going to take some brown marker and put

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,750
some fake stains on it I'm going to try

00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,490
and sell this to people let's see if you

00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,990
will buy it i'll do some search engine

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,450
advertising see if like I can actually

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,850
get customers like you could use this

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:30,230
whole product development strategy on

00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:33,710
the stained underwear product and figure

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,750
out does this work once you figured out

00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:40,070
yes people will in fact by this and by

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:43,190
the way this picture comes from amazon

00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:46,250
com you can buy this product right now

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,620
if you are out there wandering like did

00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,420
he just make this up no this is an

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,670
actual product I found while searching

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,060
for like money belts and whatnot on

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,770
amazon com like you can do this and if

00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,960
you travel a lot and you need stained

00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,920
underwear pre-stained you don't even

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:11,660
have to add your own stains like this is

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:13,490
this is the alright so i guess i'm

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,220
going to leave with one more Karl Popper

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:18,590
quote he says great scientists are men

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,690
of bold ideas but highly critical of

00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,940
their own ideas they try to find whether

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,340
their ideas are the right are right by

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,920
trying first to find whether they're not

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,930
perhaps wrong like he's a philosopher so

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,540
he says not perhaps wrong he means

00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:37,670
stupid or and my proposal is

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,290
that this is like you could cross out

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,050
great scientists and say great product

00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,820
managers and it would be exactly true of

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,400
product management it would be exactly

00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,960
true of how not to waste your life doing

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,390
stupid like

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,339
asked your ideas come up with a crazy

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,670
idea like if you actually think you can

00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,790
cure cancer like great test that if you

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:04,290
think you can like solve problems with

00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,450
the way people buy well I'm not going to

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,150
come up with all the product ideas but

00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,130
like I think we are doing great things

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,960
that canonical I think juju is very

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,930
interesting one of the things that I'm

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,430
very interested to do is test this and

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,160
go talk to people who are actually using

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,660
it make sure that my understanding of

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,720
what people need and what we are

00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,550
building matchup make sure that the open

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,700
source product we're creating and the

00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:32,130
need in the community fit correctly like

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,720
this is the job that you should be doing

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,960
so that you know that what you're

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,790
building is not a waste of time because

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,760
your life has your heart has only so

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:50,310
many beats so with that I'll answer

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:52,740
questions so people over in pole three

00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,750
if you have questions don't raise your

00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,990
hand walk to the back of the room and

00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,940
form a queue there and I will bring the

00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:05,820
mic over there so that we can ask

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:08,220
questions they're maintaining the

00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,109
tradition of pike on okay I completely

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,210
agree fantastic talk one of the issues

00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:15,060
though is there's a big difference

00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,530
between data and knowledge it's easy to

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,490
do experiments you can do experiments

00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,920
but there's no point if the experiment

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,089
is completely wrong so Fred take you a

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,000
practical example you were looking at

00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:25,320
your download page for sourceforge your

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
experiment you could say ok my

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
experimental method for determining

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,880
whether this page works is how many

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,740
people visit this page click on the

00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,270
download button and that sounds on first

00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,560
approximation a reasonable kind of

00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,369
metric for whether or not the page is

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,540
working but if you'd redesign the page

00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:40,980
and people don't click on the download

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,900
button because it enables them to

00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,750
discover that this is the wrong package

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,040
easier then your metric is going to go

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,470
down even though the page is actually

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,089
more successful but the actual problem

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:54,089
is the fact the search page is returned

00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,440
the wrong results so have you got any

00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:56,460
comments on how do you establish that

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,470
you're actually doing the right

00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,030
experiment in the first place so you

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,760
don't end up doing lots and lots of data

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,310
pointing

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,650
completely the wrong direction so that

00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:11,140
is a very very good question and that is

00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:12,610
exactly the problem with science how do

00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,190
you figure out that you're doing the

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:18,790
right experiment and the way you do that

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:21,040
is like you try to be smart like you try

00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:24,160
to eliminate variables so like we go to

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,100
say we know people like VLC on

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,190
sourceforge most people come to download

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:32,410
VLC from the VLC page not from our

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,600
search result page we know those people

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,910
really really want to download VLC

00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,320
because they were on the VLC page then

00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,050
they come to the sourceforge page and

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,000
then they want to download it right so

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,710
those people are highly unlikely to

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,110
think that this is the wrong page maybe

00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,660
we test with just them and we eliminate

00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,870
all of the other traffic for the purpose

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,900
of this test this actually is a much

00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,420
more difficult question than even his

00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,370
question realized because one of the

00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,010
things that this page does also is show

00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,510
ads when people get the download faster

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,040
they spend less time looking at ads they

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,410
click on the adds less we make us money

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:11,110
so there's another whole trade-off that

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,460
we need to think through like getting

00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:15,100
people the thing that they want the

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,590
fastest that they can can also cost us a

00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,150
lot of money and so how do we deal with

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:23,350
this and how do we balance all these

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:25,300
things like sometimes as you go deeper

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,830
and deeper you have more and more

00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,300
experiments that you have to do to test

00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,620
your hypothesis like my assumption was

00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,380
that the faster people get to the

00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,120
download page which has a lot of ads the

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,980
more money will make because they will

00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,190
get will get more people to that page

00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,200
and that page monetizes like 10 or 20

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,600
times as well as the project summary

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,770
page and we did a test in that actually

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:52,810
mostly bared out to be true but

00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:56,340
designing experiments well is the hard

00:40:52,810 --> 00:41:01,790
work of product management in my opinion

00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:05,780
other questions and next question

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:08,450
hi so we've sourceforge you obviously

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,010
have a lot of traffic going to it and

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:14,300
canonical and a whole bunch of other

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:17,050
places have you got any tips for people

00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,020
that are really really just starting out

00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:25,130
getting that traffic so you can actually

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,010
test like if you don't get any hits at

00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:30,440
all you can't test so it's a little bit

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,790
off-topic but kind of rare well no

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,970
that's not off topic at all I don't

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:39,740
think like my first set of tests that

00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:42,260
you do are around acquiring customers or

00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:45,530
visitors to your site like and that is

00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:49,750
hard work sometimes you do marketing on

00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:52,040
related like forums sometimes you do

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,260
marketing like you do search engine

00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,810
marketing you pay for search clicks

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,180
whatever you have to do to get a few

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,680
clicks and you don't need a ton when

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,380
you're just getting started because

00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,450
chances are like you need a big sample

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,920
size if you want to know the difference

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,350
between a two percent conversion rate

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,450
and three percent conversion rate but if

00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,120
you have a hundred people show up your

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,700
website and none of them want to buy

00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,710
your product that is the most likely

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,150
result that you're going to get when

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,550
you're just starting out is that you

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,400
were totally wrong and it's not going to

00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,280
work at all so buying a hundred klicks

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,740
is not so expensive and then you can

00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,640
figure out oh we are totally off-base

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:36,080
let's rethink this and it's totally

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,730
worth it because then you're not wasting

00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,390
weeks of your life building a thing that

00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:43,850
nobody wants so sometimes you buy click

00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,520
sometimes you have to figure out other

00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,740
ways and it really depends on your

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:54,050
product like I have a friend who like

00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:56,540
sells patterns for needlework stuff on

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,980
her blog and she uses a lot of these

00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,070
techniques and you don't need a lot of

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,890
traffic you just need to get the ideas

00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,590
figured out and then you can like with

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,750
the traffic you have a lot of times

00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,280
small changes make big enough

00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,980
differences that even small amounts of

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,990
traffic you can see a statistically

00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,840
significant

00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:19,869
result I think we're going to have to

00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,900
make this the last one I guess it's

00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:26,320
excuse me related to the last question

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:29,040
we do do testing obviously need to test

00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:33,730
long enough for a to be statistically

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,700
significant and we have trouble kind of

00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:39,490
explaining to some of the less technical

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,740
people that you need to run it for you

00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:44,670
know not just a day or not just some

00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:47,950
hours but days and weeks to be able to

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:50,619
find that statistically significant dev

00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,540
any advice on you know explaining that

00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:54,220
to people who don't really understand

00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:59,470
the scientific method as well as you

00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:01,660
know some of the other people I guess I

00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,119
have a couple of pieces of advice one of

00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,340
which is kind of just me being a jackass

00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,619
which is like if people don't get it

00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:13,270
maybe try and find a place to work where

00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:15,790
people are not stupid it might be harder

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:20,590
than it seems but that's my jackass

00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:22,300
answer my other answer is like trying to

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,300
explain science to people who don't get

00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,950
science is hard especially if they've

00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,020
already grown up to adulthood and

00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:37,450
somehow gone through school without ever

00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:39,040
figuring this out but also if you're not

00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,350
in the optimization phase if you're

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,240
still in the discovery phase a lot of

00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:46,450
times you get to a significantly

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,760
significant result quickly or else it

00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,710
doesn't matter what is statistically

00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,359
significant if you're showing like a two

00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,310
percent difference between two options

00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,380
and you still don't know whether you

00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:57,640
have a working business model two

00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,320
percent difference is not going to make

00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,109
the difference between this business

00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,550
model survives or it doesn't so the

00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:05,850
tests already showed you what you need

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,200
to know which is it doesn't matter

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,060
whereas if it's like eighty percent

00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,260
different the tests showed you what you

00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,359
need to know which is that it does

00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,400
matter and it showed you that in a much

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,690
quicker time because you don't need to

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,300
know that it's eighty percent you need

00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:22,080
to know that it's a lot better so

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:26,320
sometimes statistically significant is

00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,890
less strenuous than you thought and that

00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,880
they were actually writer than you

00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:33,470
even though they don't understand which
