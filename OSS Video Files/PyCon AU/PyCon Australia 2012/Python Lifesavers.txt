Every now and then you'll find yourself with one of life's tricky situations. OK, so maybe not a literally life-threatening one. But when you remember Python is a batteries-included, script-like programming language found pretty much e

alright alright our next presenter is an

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,049
IT consultant to access the zookeeper

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,730
maintainer for Lenny's conf au 2012

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,309
that's due keeper the wonderful

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,360
conference management system that we

00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:14,880
used on this program in this conference

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,160
to lose config it was held in Ballarat

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,539
in January in this talk Duncan MacNeil

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,010
will be sharing tips and tricks from his

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,369
collection of Python lifesavers please

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:28,320
make him welcome thank you very much

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,760
I've a lot to cover so I'm going to

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,080
either speak really quickly or keep

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,149
every third word I don't know which is

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,130
better a little bit about me before we

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,620
get started there is a bit of a

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,899
continuum people who are happy enough

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,210
just to be able to place a call on the

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,940
left and people who are not satisfied

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,129
until they can make every call in the

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,270
universe and I've placed a little red X

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,430
here particularly in this room I feel as

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,620
though I'm way down this end in terms of

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,109
my technical prowess but that's actually

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,260
a good thing because that allows me to

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,000
be incredibly opinionated and look down

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,320
at a great height on thing so if I say

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,740
something in this in the course of this

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,299
talk like Java is rubbish you know just

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,950
just pass it off as he doesn't know what

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,310
he's talking about right it's

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,619
unsubstantiated so being this non

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,420
technical guy who does a fair bit of

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,189
Python stuff around from time to time I

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,439
can kind of relax about the you know

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,630
python whether or not it is a real

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,310
language or script di here developers

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,220
talking about all you can't use you must

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,920
don't you can't use a postgres in and

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,530
Tyson and they're not real you know

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,579
Oracle and java is the way to go

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,159
meanwhile i'm playing happy because I'm

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,720
not it I don't have to report to a boss

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,979
or anything like that i can i can do

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,110
things that the command like and do

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:52,350
things in python like this and for

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:55,320
instance having finished linux

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,090
conference hearing the famous quote

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,119
being volunteering is the worst kind of

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,579
slavery i wanted to know if I'd be burnt

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,310
out too burnt out to to do my talk at

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,910
PyCon take time minus till noon time

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,330
Delta 211 days I've put enough time to

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,330
do a talk

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:18,550
stuff like this using using Python as a

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,080
scripting language I can't remember who

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,310
made this quote that's very famous

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,000
probably everyone there's no who's but

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,550
all significant programming is hacking

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,750
right because if you're not hacking if

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,420
you're not experimenting like this

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,300
you're probably configuring in a

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,360
framework right and if you are doing a

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,790
lot of repetitive same stuff boilerplate

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,290
code over and over again then maybe you

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,430
haven't found the right framework yet or

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,050
maybe you're not doing stuff on a high

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,460
level enough because all the significant

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,750
stuff you should be doing should be

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,400
experimental and there's a good chance

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,220
it won't work the first time you try it

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,840
well that's what I believe anyway just

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,580
before I leave this very simple datetime

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,800
example my first life-saving tip would

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,770
be find a single point to do you take

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,430
datetime stuff from see if quite common

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:08,200
people do they use now in a database as

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,150
things being inserted so there's one

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,390
point of checking the time they use a

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,620
bit of Python daytime stuff well they

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,960
might even use the operating system

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,370
actually three sources of time people

00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,710
think I'm times the same everywhere you

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,410
go right I did I'm old enough to have

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,390
done y2k testing sailed through y2k

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,450
testing beautiful not a problem in the

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,550
world Sydney Olympics comes every system

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,440
falls over because no one can agree

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,560
whether in Melbourne is it daylight

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,680
saving because Sydney is right so big

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,420
one point for your dates and times are a

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,310
little bit more radical I say don't even

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,230
store it in bait format in the database

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,850
I don't trust databases that much with

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,380
my dates and times I actually convert

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,670
them to string can convert them back on

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,320
the way out that's how extreme land

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,580
about 1.4 your date and time who's seen

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,940
this can I have a show of hands who've

00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,820
seen this trick okay for those of you

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,220
who haven't put your hand off this is

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,030
probably you know with the price of

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,680
admission alone so it's a little trick

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,120
and the first for those of you guys see

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,340
that you're probably looking gone I try

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,730
to the command line and gunned it works

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,710
what happens is you go to a directory on

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,200
a computer your type Python minus M

00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,810
simple HTTP server the minus M flag

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,450
basically says take the module and

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,880
just run it okay and that serves the

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,450
current directory by default on port

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,650
8000 right now for those of you have try

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,240
to the command line see that it actually

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,770
runs up a web server and you can browse

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,130
to that directory and see the files and

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,740
done that it works consider how useful

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,480
it can be to get you out of a bind and

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,620
if you keep that in if you write that

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,380
down somewhere keep in the back your

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,550
head one day somewhere probably three

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,740
o'clock in the morning you'll be sitting

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,870
in a server room going why can't I just

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,210
get this freaking file from this machine

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,740
to this machine I don't have its I have

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,910
keys I can't transfer them because I

00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,710
don't have all three if I can't stall

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,160
the software try that on the command

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:06,940
line is it secure no is it

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,860
multi-threaded know but they've

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,740
countered that is it secure you'll be

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,270
piping any attempts to connect into a

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,889
file you can check that filing know you

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,540
were the only one who downloaded a file

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,889
and obviously you copy something into a

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,139
directory so let's have a look a real

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,940
world example of that don't worry if you

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,620
can't read this from the back I just

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,240
wanted to point out that it is useful

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,820
for more than just experimenting this is

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,680
a little prep project of mine when you

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,080
start off an amazon server you can paste

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,020
bash script into the user data thing and

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,820
it'll run that bash script as root this

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,340
is a kind of an emerging field known as

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,690
infrastructure as code right you have

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,370
your code you have the machine that you

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,050
want to set up by basically

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,669
configuration your PO that you posted in

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,639
there when startup so here's a script

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,190
that installs a moodle install some of

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,300
you in the room will know what Moodle is

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,610
takes a fair while for it for the

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,470
install to finish so what we do is jump

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,010
down into a directory just push a

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,960
straight HTML file down in the directory

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,690
and serve it and you'll see it's got

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,729
this meta equiv refresh' content to so

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,440
when you go to the amazon server even

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,930
before you've got a web server installed

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,120
it's going to show up and respond on

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,590
port 80 because i've used the the

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,020
optional you can put a number on the end

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,030
of that little puffin minus m simple

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,340
HTTP server 80 so that's the standard

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,930
port i go to the new Amazon server and

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,400
it's going to say hey we're loading

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,690
Moodle we're installing the database all

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
this kind of stuff then at the end we

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,009
kill the Python process and then we

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,300
start the reel web server

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,349
by that time you've done another meta

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,889
refresh and you're in your middle

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:43,919
install so handy tip and these sort of

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,710
tips using scripting things to kind of

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,439
get you out of a bind it's really handy

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,499
to know and do and learn in Python

00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,839
because of pythons everywhere something

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:57,229
I found recently I think it's supposed

00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,659
to be pronounced replete as in the

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,830
internet is replete with examples so if

00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,349
anyone's played with a very famous

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,599
jsfiddle where you can put in some

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:09,300
JavaScript get a URL instantly and share

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,309
it this is jsfiddle for Python and lure

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,800
and I think it's check it out sometime

00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:17,969
or check out these the slides at the end

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,580
and have a look at these increasingly

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,939
we're getting better performance for

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,059
Python on Android devices and this

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,379
drives me crazy okay I may have said in

00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:31,169
the introduction that I think java's

00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,119
rubbish but if you can employ Python in

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,520
Java if it actually shows that you know

00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,990
the language is capable they just didn't

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,990
write it with humans in mind you know

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,949
which by the way even if you've seen the

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,599
other trick Python isn't always

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:47,969
installed by default on every server

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,099
right but Java usually is right so if

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,080
you've got the jasonj are just sitting

00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,419
it's a file somewhere you can fire up

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,370
Java minus jaar jaar jaar jaar minus m

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:04,979
simple HTTP server and you're serving

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:07,349
over 40,000 so life gets easier you have

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:12,120
all these little kind of tips and tricks

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:15,959
and things you can do with Python but

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,819
python is very I guess from my point of

00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,319
view very text oriented you do stuff on

00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,569
your nipple eight things and text comes

00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,819
in and inputs come out and so this is

00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,559
this is a really simple example just

00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,349
showing what a fleet looks like and I've

00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:30,360
chosen a scenario where 45 days in a

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:33,209
week I've got ten groups and I want to

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,639
split them some signage up that puts

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,349
half of the groups into the Mason room

00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,899
and the other into the Berkeley room

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,219
very very simple right the trouble is

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,289
when you when you're given a task like

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,410
that and i highly recommend whenever

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,949
you've got something like that

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,449
don't do it by hand or music cell use

00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:51,370
your use your Python skills in and

00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,810
exercise them try to do this stuff at

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,149
the command line the trouble is your

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,250
output someone's going to have asked you

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,250
to do something with this go in and

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,439
register me a room request for each of

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,019
these or something like that and the

00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:06,490
trouble with that approach is yet I can

00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,839
I can generate a lot but I have to do

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:17,620
something and the problem is that life

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:21,339
itself doesn't come with an API so let's

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,870
assume and I just know my eye twitching

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:24,730
a little as i say this let's just assume

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,500
that someone wants you for some weird

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,269
reason to come up with that list of all

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,860
the different days of the week and split

00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,569
into 10 groups in the Berkeley room and

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,839
Mason room and they want you to put it

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:36,189
into PowerPoint right make me a

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,870
PowerPoint slide with all I think so

00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,279
we're going to print those out well can

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,410
I just do it as a PDF or something a

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,189
second I can type my output into a PDF

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,199
generator no I want you know a nice

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:50,130
power funny because I know PowerPoint

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:53,620
that's its portal like an Edison right

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,610
now some of the more technical guides

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,839
much it would probably jump into

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,699
something like a a Windows w32 calm

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,860
interface and try and manipulate you

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,880
know the underlying thing I wouldn't

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,170
recommend doing that could you'll spend

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,139
more time doing that than you would

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,360
actually do this so this is where the

00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:14,560
Coulee comes to the rescue anyone here

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,990
heard of this project so coolly okay so

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,839
that the one-line web server didn't

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,480
surprise me it amazes me it amazed

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,569
astounds me that this project isn't

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,079
better known it's a simple little idea

00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:30,699
but it's a phenomenal paradigm shift for

00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,370
people who want to get stuff done we

00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:35,290
talked about a thomas tune book about

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,689
scientific revolutions and paradigm

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,269
shift this I think is a paradigm shift

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:44,199
because it does one little trick and it

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:47,670
does it really well here's my script

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:50,589
highlighted in blue days of the week

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,809
almost kind of stuff and then down the

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,660
bottom and this is a Jason project by

00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:58,180
the way and it saw it interprets the

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,960
the top end you says a little click

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,430
little image there and then type which

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,110
is basically another click and type

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:13,780
command and it's using pictures so

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:15,850
securely is the project that allows you

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,220
to script but take screenshots in your

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,230
scripts and and check against the

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,360
current screen does the screenshot or

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,140
fraction of a screenshot exist and if so

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,510
I can interact with it right so it looks

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,140
as though this is a useful tool because

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,670
I can somehow insert screenshots in here

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,180
and have it click but the really cool

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,680
thing is when I actually go to insert

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,420
one of these click commands in see it's

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,760
got a little photo icon in there what it

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,680
does is minimize the editor and brings

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,890
you up in a thing where you can actually

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,480
select on the screen so i select new

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,380
slide and this is where i want to click

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,540
so i'm going to click right in the

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,400
middle of the beautiful microsoft ribbon

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,410
there we're out in this middle layer

00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:04,960
okay and the smart thing is it's got OCR

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:06,850
built in so it actually takes that

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,950
little image and converts the name vert

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,420
to new slide PNG because it's detected

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,220
that the words new and slider in there

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,710
so that's cool already and it runs this

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,780
documentation as well so I've used this

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,910
not just to to make things but actually

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,380
run unit tests and it also works as

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,330
documentation as well because the name

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,500
of the file is instructive if I

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,430
nationally shows you what it's going to

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:31,050
do then when you replay it so I've got a

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:36,880
little iteration it's basically saying

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:40,480
click the next slide and then click the

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:45,670
action and type the text right so now

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,010
anything with the GUI is instantly has

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,530
an open API for you to ER to attack now

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,350
think what that means it is really

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,390
awesome this is a project it's a

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,670
MIT project it's open source it runs on

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,640
mac OS it runs on linux it runs on

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,800
windows and it's got this slow-motion

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,490
replay mode well as well so if you want

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,250
to run like scripted demos and you want

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,570
to run it on a

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,540
p double patterning you want to record

00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,520
it turn it on it on in slow motion mode

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,810
and it has a fuzzy searching mode as

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,830
well so which I'll explain at the moment

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,900
but effectively what it does it's

00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,520
running over my script and it has that

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,080
bit where it says click new slide so it

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,580
actually searches the whole screen to

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,440
match that image I'm going to find the

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,390
image it goes up there it circled it

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,740
when it's in slow motion mode and just

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,420
so that's I'm about to click here and

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,070
then it clicks it and it comes over and

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,380
it says like a new slide and you can see

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:38,990
it's got about 13 slides through here

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,120
when I took the screenshot so now

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,130
there's an even greater reason to use

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,910
those kind of script d elements of your

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:49,280
of your Python projects and and hook

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:54,260
them up to the world as though

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:58,760
everything had an API now the fuzzy

00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,140
searching bit when it said clicking you

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,700
slide I didn't that add only after

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,960
parameters I just added the image this

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,460
is what I'm looking for on the screen if

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,530
I put a comment put a second parameter

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,960
now I can actually define how certain

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,430
should I be that I've actually got I've

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,860
catch of that image so there are people

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,390
who've been playing around with sikuli

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,910
we picked up a teddy bear their foot

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,260
teddy bear in the webcam right and then

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,589
they go I want to test for the presence

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,089
of Teddy when I put the Teddy into the

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,410
webcam and i'll give it a fuzziness

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,910
level they've been playing by moving

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,800
that fast in this level up and down and

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,150
you've got kind of a kind of a

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,460
recognition framework there and people

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,330
are doing amazing things with sikuli and

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,330
i can't recommend it enough

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:47,980
so I'm changing chopper to you the other

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,839
thing that that I think is is kind of

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,610
cool when you when you are used to using

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,559
Python at the command line hacking

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,379
things experimenting things is a

00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,470
framework that allows you to do web

00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:01,329
applications but do them just as though

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,920
you're kind of experimenting on the

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,059
command line as well so I've been in

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,889
search of this something and I know

00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,589
there's a lot of emphasis on Jango

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:11,379
there's a lot of emphasis on pylons and

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,179
pyramid as it becomes him known but I

00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,589
particularly like web 2 pi if no one who

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:17,230
has checked it out I strongly recommend

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,379
that at least you go to web 2 pi and

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,730
read the documentation for it I've got

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,040
an affiliation with a project or

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,660
anything other than I'm a user of it but

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,369
as I read through the documentation I

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,049
found myself nodding all the way through

00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:30,970
if everything they've done for you

00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,679
they've done right and I haven't forced

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,299
you to do it that way but you choose to

00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,939
do it that way anyway because they do it

00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,350
right and in particular they've got this

00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:40,089
thing called plugin wiki which is a

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,769
plug-in for it right it's meant to be

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:46,540
the the do all do everything wiki and

00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:50,230
and it provides a wiki like in the face

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,970
and it allows public and private pages

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,889
like a wiki expect but it also allows

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,589
these three levels so the first is like

00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,809
address is traditional wiki you can like

00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:02,910
you know adding text images audio the

00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:07,869
second level you can also include

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:09,429
widgets and components so these are hold

00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:14,139
is a pre-written bits that you could

00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:16,269
you'd probably trust a seasoned web user

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,459
to use and then the last version you can

00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:22,509
just use just straight web to pipe code

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:25,419
so what does all sorry Python so what

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,459
does that look like so there's a little

00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,559
bit more about this you can choose

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,329
between having markman or HTML WYSIWYG

00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,379
so you can make the wiki part really

00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:36,610
quite simple then there's a collection

00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,860
of widgets which are kind of self

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,679
document and they can be embedded as you

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,730
go and which helps for people who have

00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,889
got a certain amount of technical

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,199
ability but not so much and then it's

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,869
got a set of special pages which allow

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,390
you to do things like meta code and set

00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:54,120
up the menu for the thing and

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,330
and customized databases and things like

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,670
that add tables to databases are ensured

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:04,079
that tables exist so what does that

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:05,820
actually look like for widgets you

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,240
basically go into the wiki builder and

00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,589
there's a list of predefined ones and

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,750
you select a thing fill in a little

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,510
table and what you get back is some like

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:20,390
little wiki code but you can paste in

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:24,360
and use for things like Maps comments

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,760
aggregators pie charts search boxes

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,860
slideshows star ratings tag clouds all

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,380
that kind of thing so if you're in the

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,870
habit of needing to build take an idea

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,150
and build an application out of it

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,830
really quickly consider using something

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,020
that already has this is like batteries

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,280
included for the web you know you can

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,180
pull something out you can experiment

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,600
with the idea again is embedding Python

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:52,350
code in a wiki secure will it perform

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,540
well well I don't know I can't answer

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,400
that question I don't I suspect not but

00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,960
what it does later do is prototype so

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
rapidly that you can discard your bad

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,640
ideas quick and that's my much higher

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,350
definition of success discard the bad

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,450
ideas quickly so here's my famous now

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,310
famous Berkeley Mason room Berkeley

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,410
mason room Monday Tuesday Wednesday all

00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,720
the way through the week to implement

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:19,050
that in web 2 pi is simply to go and add

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,750
a wiki page and just throw your your

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,080
python code directly into the template

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,940
and run it and you by the way it imports

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,890
for you but imagine above this line

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,770
there's a whole lot of a poor imports

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,350
for data layer abstraction so you can

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,330
access a database if you connected 14

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,070
run time and date functions for a whole

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,730
bunch of stuff that's useful out of the

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,440
box authentication rolls based but in

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,570
this case I can just throw in my Python

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,930
code and have it run and hero instead of

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,700
print I've got a heading level 2 I can

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,370
choose a role for which this page is

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,660
accessible probably people at the back

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,590
can't see this but just trust me I'm

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,840
pointing at a box that says roll there's

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,310
a change log and just like any good wiki

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,100
it keeps the history of the pages

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,300
well I've got 10 minute song and I raced

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,670
through so I've chopped and changed

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,410
during this this presentation but what

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:18,180
I've tried to I guess hids as a

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,920
recurring theme is if you ever find

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,560
yourself doing something over and over

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,830
again as a template mode all of us as

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,380
developers know spend your time finding

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,000
ways to take stuff that you know you can

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,740
automate and automate it faster so you

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
don't have that decision between should

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,330
I actually type out a hundred values and

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,490
then put it into PowerPoint or should I

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,640
learn a way to do that so I like become

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,040
like a more powerful human and the other

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,230
idea is experiment with stuff often and

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,370
early and discard bad ideas and that

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,590
makes you much more effective than

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,570
getting everything just perfect and

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:56,370
building tiny little layers that will

00:19:51,570 --> 00:20:00,080
get you a very kind of slow way in a

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,720
very slow time so it's very opinionated

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,640
this presentation has been rather brief

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,490
I want to do some demos if I if I have

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:15,120
some time and yeah that's basically the

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,010
essence any questions before I jump into

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,600
a actually I might I'm honestly just

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,160
quickly so I think we've got 10 minutes

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,840
left on the present yet rather than

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,820
think I'll just quickly jump into sikuli

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,650
because I just think that's one aspect

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,690
of this thing that I just couldn't

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:34,680
resist doing a real live demo and of

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:37,460
course this won't work five mins good so

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,460
just bear with me

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,280
here

00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:06,070
okay so here's my here's my my script

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:10,420
I'll take out the click here let me take

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:13,240
the whole line out and I'll just hip and

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:19,720
I'll just go to powerpoint again and

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:21,460
I'll just do a new one let me just show

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,410
you what happens when I hit this I mean

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,640
an idea i can use any python here it's

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,240
just basically a python interpreter

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,850
build on top of jeff n so what's going

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,250
to do is dim down the screen I select my

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,810
new slide option that's what I want to

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,340
click on and again I can give it a

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,900
fuzziness rating and you'll notice that

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,520
there's a find and find also i can

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,170
actually have if there's a dozen

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,490
checkboxes on the screen find all the

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,170
checkboxes and do something then check

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,580
your mail clicks and drags options all

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:50,290
that kind of stuff the other thing I

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,270
wanted was type on something so again

00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,710
it's just the same thing I want to type

00:21:52,270 --> 00:22:00,100
in a particular route this is the thing

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:05,370
never try a live demo I'll just do that

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:09,480
again it'll switch back for me securely

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,410
what I wanted to have first was this

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:18,670
other thing is going to let me switch

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:20,020
out of new presentation here we go so

00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:27,570
the other thing I want to do then is

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:31,380
just hit my type and I want to type here

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,380
come up my text

00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,240
does that look about right and let's

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:41,370
just run this in slow motion mode and

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,760
see what happens isn't that neat isn't

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,320
that just the first time I actually

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,470
downloaded this and did this it was just

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,720
so nice for me to think that this was

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,670
possible and now any anything with the

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,650
univ user interface is kind of open for

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,059
me to hack and this is increasingly

00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,309
important for people if anyone knows

00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,830
about URL live in their kind of posting

00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:04,470
forms and setting up things on the web

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,520
by manipulating restful api s what's

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,960
happening in you'll see this happens

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,300
with fritter and other accounts ease

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,380
you'll get blocked eventually the people

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,390
will actually get fed up with you

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,679
manipulating the rest api so what

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,630
happens in a lot of frameworks now is

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,370
you can't automatically just post by

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,770
visiting URL or doing a restful thing

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,510
you actually have to do kind of either

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,040
simulator browser or actually use a

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,690
browser and this is the way to get

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,830
around it so i'll take questions while

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,059
this is running actually because they're

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,260
kind of added it is running in slow

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,610
motion mode that's that's not an

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,720
indication of performance this is just

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,100
the mode where it shows you what it's

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,679
doing i'm going to click here and they

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:42,090
look like here that i'm going to type

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:44,190
questions so you're just looking at the

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,929
security stuff it doesn't only run

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,210
inside the idea it can actually be run

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:49,950
as a standalone script oh yeah like from

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,059
the command line to Dawn's yeah thank

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,220
you very much for the question two

00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,500
things I forgot to mention the first is

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,240
sikuli allows you to then compile the

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,559
thing and distribute it as an executable

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,990
so someone can just double click on it

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,640
and here's my slide presentation creator

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,860
and it's got a whole bunch of extra

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,900
little things like pop up a dialog box

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,250
to capture some entry so you might say

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,520
what's room 1 and what's room 2 and they

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,020
type it in and that's been done in a

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,390
cross-platform Wayne the other thing I

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,910
forgot to mention which is amazingly

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,340
awesome is that rather than just click

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,110
or find on the screen you can say assert

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,780
that this is on the screen and that

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,190
hooks into J unit testing right I was

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,300
involved with a project not so long ago

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:34,440
that had so many use cases and was only

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,059
really kind of we were in a virtual kind

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,740
of simulated environment the only way to

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,170
really test the software is working was

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,050
to do this kind of stuff on use cases

00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,850
through the GUI and we automated the

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,620
whole thing

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,210
and the great thing is we're moving

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,220
we're still mucking around with you I

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,780
will moving buttons around and so coolly

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,000
we're still finding the button don't

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,740
confuse this with an XY point of click

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,690
thing this is actually doing the fuzzy

00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,700
search to find the button wherever it

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,710
happens to be on the screen and click

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,000
the object and that's why it's so much

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,980
awesome than any other kind of

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,860
automation tool I've seen thanks for the

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,419
question any more questions it's

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:16,520
whatever we want to we want to I'll

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:18,770
repeat the question does it launch the

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,409
application no but I believe there is a

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,049
there is an open command and the open

00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:26,960
basically sends the open command back

00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:30,049
down to the system there's a standard

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,520
jython to I think it's one their OS

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,610
library or something it says command

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,220
open surgeon you can open application so

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,830
that would be platform-specific

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,320
obviously the only other gotchas I did

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,840
tell just the slightest little fear by

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,280
said it works on mac OS and Linux there

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,419
are some variants of Linux are

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,850
particularly with the new and gnome and

00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:53,120
new informations of implementations of

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,890
the ex windowing system which just for

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,390
whatever reason doesn't work the other

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,190
thing which to my huge frustration

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,940
doesn't seem to work is when you connect

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,380
it over over rdp to a server remotely is

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,510
one of the ideas I had for this is if

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,830
you've got an API to anything I can put

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,409
it in the cloud and I can make all these

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:12,049
awesome services but for some reason it

00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,030
doesn't recognize I guess screen 0 in a

00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:16,039
Linux world as being the one that's

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,360
being presented over rdp I'm sure

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,549
there's a fix for that i'm sure there's

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,440
like click on screen represented by

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:25,159
which works for both the lineage problem

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,650
and the the RDP problem but as a desktop

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,039
tool it's still freaking awesome I just

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:33,860
love watching I could watch that all day

00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:36,460
alright one more question last question

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,460
anyone

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,910
would this be a good tool to test how

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,780
things appear in different browsers

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:54,410
automatically yes there was someone very

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,410
cleverly worked out how to play the

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:59,360
Facebook bejeweled or befuddled game

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,160
with sikuli and a couple of lines of

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,600
script and so someone from that thought

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,559
well you actually you could you could

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,610
launch this from a whole lot of

00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,250
different areas and see the

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,200
representation was actually working kind

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,330
of okay I'll actually just quickly stop

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,530
this script now because I'm sure a lot

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,480
of people are going to want to check out

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,250
so coolly but they'll forget the name so

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
if you want to see these slides and get

00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,840
all the URLs for all the goodness that

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,580
is web 2 pi and securely and the

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,520
one-line Python trick which is

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,230
searchable karti jicama slaw and flash

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Python or that one and I'm sure these

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,000
slides will be made available as well

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,000
