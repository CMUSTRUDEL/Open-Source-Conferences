i don't know why you're saying that

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
quite possibly i do have everyone's

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
details in zookeeper so i can like send

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
hate mail or something like that to

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,079
everyone in the conference statistically

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,440

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
four minutes

talks instead

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,520

the people who volunteered to give talks

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,120
i'll just change the timer

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,879
i like a challenge two four zero

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,400
that's four minutes isn't it oh no it's

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,400
not it's broken

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
excellent okay so up first we have

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
oh before we start uh people who are

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,479
presenting lightning talks

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,880
um plug into the um plug into the device

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
or the the projector cable at the

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
lectern that's not being used

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
and set your external monitor which will

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,479
appear connected even though it's not on

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
the screen it will appear connected

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
set that monitor to output at 1024 by

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,479
768.

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,640
our av people will tell you whether or

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,640
not your laptop is working

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
don't stop fiddling with it until it

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
works and they will tell you if it is

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
working

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
so up first we have josh hesketh and

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,479
secondly we have tim ansel so if you can

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,600
set up over there that would be great

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,720
um so your time starts

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
okay now i've got a lot of mistakes to

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
talk about i'm going to talk really fast

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,719
and i'm sorry if you can't understand me

00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
we've made mistakes for this conference

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
leading up to it and doing it and i'm

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
going to go over them

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,399
and what happened basically don't trust

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,680
people because people suck

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,719
no that's not true people don't say

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
people just make mistakes and that's the

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,879
side of my talk i just couldn't decide

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,319
which one i wanted

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,520
uh because it's human to make mistakes

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,959
and i probably make more mistakes than

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
most of you that makes me more human

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
than you

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,200
uh however i'm gonna go through in

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
reverse chronological order the mistakes

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,239
so

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
starting from now this talk this morning

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
coffee from this machine

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
i had a longo i don't know what that is

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
um

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
toothpaste i brushed my teeth and had

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
orange juice that was a mistake but that

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,760
these are my mistakes um

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
and only a few of them uh last night

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
yeah not really much of a mistake a

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,840
little bit of mistake

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
apparently it takes 40 minutes to get a

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,480
taxi from uh

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,640
west point or from hobart down to

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
peppermint bay um so taxis they're a

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,519
mistake

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,040
here's what happened um basically we

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
called cavs and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
you know first ones came delayed half an

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,840
hour in the end

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,400
i got my taxi at five minutes to 12. uh

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
that is over two hours late so taxis

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,640
they're a mistake

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
this guy is a mistake this is duncan uh

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
he didn't really make a mistake but he

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,159
contemplated making a mistake he was uh

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,360
the mistake that he was completely

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
making was such a big mistake that's a

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
mistake complimenting it

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
so the mistake he was kind of planning

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,640
was that what would happen if he

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,879
suspended the code of conduct for one

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,879
hour

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
that's a mistake to think about the vote

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
not a mistake

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,879
ways don't control them they're mistakes

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
uh this is what i wanted really to talk

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
about

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
uh thursday night just before the

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
conference i'm related to the conference

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
had a developer who had access to a

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
production machine

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,799
overwrite it with a dev database that

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
was a few months old this production

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,720
machine does about

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
two hundred thousand dollars worth of

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
transactions a day uh we lost three

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
months

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
of data what do you do you gone kill no

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,799
he's only human you made a mistake so

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
keep calm and

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,080
carry on uh we take our backup right we

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,560
have a nightly backups they uh

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
run every night about when i am right so

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,599
now we're only missing a day

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
they close business at six o'clock no

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,879
more transactions that's fine

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,319
uh developer override about 7 30. so now

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
we've got this time stamp

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,760
uh mysql actually logs everything that

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
it does into um

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
a binary blob we can get this out

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
between two times which is great

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,400
now you'll notice at the time that we're

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
getting it out is actually before the

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
time of the backup that's not a problem

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
because we use gids

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,840
and guides sorry which means we're going

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,880
to be reinserting data twice but it

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
won't really matter because

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
it will it will throw an error but the

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
data is already there it won't

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
make a difference to us updates updates

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
something twice it's still updated with

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
the same data

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
so yeah first of all uh we restored a

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
backup that's the backup being restored

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
then uh we got the bin log we outputted

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
it into some sql that's nice thank you

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,759
for sql and

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
put it back in so now success

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
uh and so that's that the next the other

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,560
mistake i made and chronologically

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
reverse i didn't have a date for this i

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
made a mistake chris came to me and said

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,199
hey you want to help run the conference

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
like

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
you know why not i i did lca i give you

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
a tip

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,840
oh yeah tips um i didn't quite realize

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,120
how much i'd be involved but uh yeah it

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,800
turns out a lot

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
that wasn't a mistake but it's not this

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,520
conference has not been a mistake so

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
that one's a bit of a lie

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,039
um wow i can talk faster than i realized

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,039
that's it thank you

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
okay up next tim followed by russell

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
keith mcgee

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:25,840
where's russ cool set up over here

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:25,840
and tim your time starts now

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
um i think pycon au is pretty awesome i

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,560
think most of you should agree

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,320
um so

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,520
it's over though um can i have

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,160
more conferency goodness um

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
it turns out linux australia the

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,840
organization that's behind paikonu

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,039
runs other things it runs other

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,759
conferences

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
and the name is a little bit kind of

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
silly because

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,880
it's not just running linux conferences

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,639
we're a

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,120
python conference not on linux

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
conference

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,639
and that's the same going for the

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,840
linux.com conference

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,160
it's not just a linux conference um

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:20,560
come along we'll only like

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,880
hit you once if you're using windows

there's a dribble down under conference

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
um

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
much about drupal

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,199
but it's supposed to be a load of fun

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,479
there's work camp if you're running

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,080

um god help you but you know

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
too

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,599

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
hobart again next year

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,039
um there are also bar camps linux

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
australia has helped run them but

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,199
other people have just run bar camps on

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
their own

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,639

open source developers conference if

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
you're using python you're kind of an

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
open source

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,199
developer but linux australia

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,360
will also help you run your own so

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,240
if you've got a cool topic say i don't

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
know

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,110
using erlang to go into space

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
why not run your own conference

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,599
[Music]

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
another thing you can do join a user

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,199
group

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
um the one i kind of help out with is

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,440
the sydney linux user group

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,039
but there's the sydney python user group

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,720
i think there's a sydney django user

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,759
group

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
and there's plenty more um i don't live

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,720
everywhere

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,720
so i can't tell you where the other ones

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,919
are

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,840
so how long have i got one minute

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
good because i have a second lightning

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,960
talk

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
um are you using dates who uses dates

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,360
everyone uses dates

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,199
so you know you use utc that's

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,840
what you do um and you should be using

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,840
python datetimetz

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
it's a drop in implementation date time

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
implementation

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,199
which cares deeply about time zones

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
it also includes extra features so you

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
can

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,720
argue that it's better

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,759
it relies on pytc and date util

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,680
you should use it it cares about your

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,360
time zones way more than you probably do

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,720
and it gets daylight savings right

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,360
according to about

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,640
60 tests um

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
that's oh thank you very much tim if you

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,720
could pass the mic to us

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,920
uh russell keith mcgee is up next frank

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
if you can set up over there that would

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,880
be great

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
that's all your time starts now okay i

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,560
am here to talk about the dsf

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
and you those of you who don't know is

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
anyone here know where the dsf is is

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,959
aware of the dsf's existence

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,560
some hands are okay for those who don't

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,640
know the dsf is the django software

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,320
foundation it is at the moment a u.s

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
registered not-for-profits unfortunately

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
we don't have tax status in australia as

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
a not-for-profit

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
we may work on that um in the future if

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
we have to um

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,160
we exist primarily as a legal and

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
uh a legal holding area for trademarks

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
and and and what have you around the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
django project itself so the copyright

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
for django is sort of

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
effectively held by by the django

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
project by the dsf the dsf is the entity

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
that owns owns that stuff

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
it's also a clearinghouse for monies you

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
want monies

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
we has monies um we have a mandate

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
essentially because we're a

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,839
not-for-profit we need to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,360
we need we gather money and we have a

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
mandate to distribute that money in a

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
way that furthers django as

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
a community furthers the cause of django

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
and so on so if you are

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
involved in something that is django

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
related

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,920
um and you need some money to help make

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,360
it happen or to help make it happen a

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
little faster or whatever

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
come and talk to me historically this

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
has meant that uh django the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
software foundation has funded events so

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
for example we're a silver sponsor here

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
at

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
pike on a you we're also sponsors of a

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
couple other conferences here and there

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,680
if you are hosting some local event and

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
a little bit of money might help like a

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,480
sprint or something like that to go and

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,079
buy the pizza

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,680
come and talk come talk to me send me an

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,399
email we can we can possibly arrange

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
that for you

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,320
we haven't got an infinite supply of

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,640
money we certainly have enough money

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,240
we also are interested in stuff any cool

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
stuff with a capital s so

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
if you have some cool django thing that

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,120
you think would be great

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
for the community as a whole come and

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,800
talk to me ask ask find out how much

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
money you think you need to make that

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
happen and we can

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
see what we can do about getting you

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
that money to make it happen we want to

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,920
make django a really really awesome

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
thing even more awesome than it is at

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
the moment

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
and we have money to throw at that why

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
do we have money

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
well we have money because we have

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,160
corporate members corporate members are

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
industry partners or industry people who

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
have uh you who use django

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
professionally and realize that there's

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,040
a benefit in supporting the community

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,839
financially so if you use django

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
commercially

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,279
please consider becoming a corporate

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
member unfortunately at the moment like

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
i said we can't say that um

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,320
you have you will get any tax write-offs

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
or tax benefits in australia

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
but if there's enough interest in

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,000
australian uh organized

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
australian companies joining the dsf we

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,279
may investigate setting that up

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,240
to try and help that go ahead so

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,399
if you want to know anything about the

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
django software foundation

djangoproject.com forward slash

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,399
foundation um hopefully the

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,240
djangoproject.com will have better links

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,000
to that in the near future email me

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,680
russell keith mcgee.com or

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,360
freakboy3721 irc

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,560
um slightly related to this

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,279

it just went small on me did it no why

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,720
is it not mirroring my display

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,800
it says it's really important obviously

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,680
wonderful why's it done small things to

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,279
me it didn't do that until now

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,519
fine no no all right let's kill that

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
and do it again okay there's a website

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
it's called

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
uh it's all slash anzac there's a talk

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
on there

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,360
right side there's a a a

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,200
website it's all dot com dot iu with

slash anzac in lower case it'll get you

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,880
to a web page somewhere in there there's

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,160
those pictures somewhat bigger than that

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
why did it do that

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,440
okay on those pictures you will

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:22,320
not see a picture of me with the large

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,959
wiggly thing i'm not crazy no

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,519
all right i am crazy furthermore i am

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
not the messiah

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,399
okay i just made that clear cause

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
someone maybe put this life of brian

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,279
t-shirt on

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,600
the other things i should mention is i

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,360
am an acs member i'm very proud of the

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
acs having sponsored this thing i've had

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,920
a while of a time

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,040
i hope you all have too the the subject

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,079
of this talk is in fact

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
1942 and all that today's sunday that's

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,480
relevant

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,519
it was a sunday on the 1st of march

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,639
1942 at about 4 30 in the morning i

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,120
reckon they got up

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
but the japanese decided to come play us

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
a visit

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,920
down here in tassie and he got out of

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,920
the water in great oyster bay

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
which is over on the east coast of

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,320
tasmania there's a big stretch of water

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,320
and you'd

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,560
probably more likely know that on the

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,440
far side of that is wine glass bay

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,800
so on the other side of the peninsula

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
over on the east coast

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,279
is that anyway so somewhere on that

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,040
website is a map

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,320
i should really fight this shouldn't i

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,519
why did it do that

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,839
this is him

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,519
yeah that's all right that's his pain so

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
he put that aeroplane together

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,519
that's pretty good picture he um put

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
this airplane together out of a

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
submarine

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
he popped it out in the water he popped

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,519
it and he then took off

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,079
and flew down the coast and then flew up

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,199
the river

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,360
and flew back down this caused

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,399
the people in tasmania to not know

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,160
anything at all

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,079
they didn't punish in the newspaper

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,639
secrecy is golden at these kind of

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,199
events

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
otherwise people like the farn school

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,160
would have gone up to interlaken but

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
wait they did

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
farn school went up to interlaken for 12

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,480
weeks

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,480
hmm somebody blabbed the

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,760
all right i hope you all gone on the

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
website because there's a nice little

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,199
map shows where the

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,440
airplane flew down there are pictures

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,360
now hopefully

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,760
of anglesey barracks which you can blow

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,519
up that's a 1939 photograph

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,040
taken by the people sorry

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,800
i can oh no this is a 1946

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,320
aerial photo which is about an inch big

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,680
when i scanned it

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,720
and that is part of the 1955 aerial

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,360
photo this is about

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,720
all the evidence the army museum has of

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
what the barracks looked like

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
in 1942 but they thought it was a really

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
good idea that i should build a model of

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
it

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,120
so they gave me some pictures of it in

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,240
1910 and they said

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,320
uh you build a model okay i said to them

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,440
that's possible i suppose

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
um they put in me in charge of somebody

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,160
who was a

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
big knob at the the museum and a bit of

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
an artist so he's very clever but he

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,279
said we should do it in balsa so we're

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,759
cutting balls and that's it there

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
and basically really what this talk is

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
about is if you're around on tuesday

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
at about 10 o'clock in the morning you

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,560
come up to angleseybacks have a look at

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,680
the model help me put the big glass

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,199
cover back on it

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,639
and generally wander around the

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,759
batteries at 11 o'clock they'll give you

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
a guided tour

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
so if anybody is about that would be

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,120
really nice and second

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,880
and would help great deal and i can't

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,639
hear any heckling come on

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
thank you okay

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,160
um if you can go set up over there that

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,839
would be great and roger

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
your time starts now

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,160
hello everyone my name is roger i've had

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,320
too much coffee and i'm going to tell

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,480
you about scraping websites

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
okay some sites suck this one in

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,519
particular some sites suck for your own

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
good

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,079
so this is a bank of which i'm a member

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,399
and i wanted to get my bank account

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,680
balance without having to press all

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,880
these buttons and

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,639
they do this lovely thing where they

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
rearrange the buttons on you every time

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
and

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,319
it sounds like a pretty good scraping

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,520
challenge to me and

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,039
basically it drove me insane so

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
this website works in a web browser

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
let's use the web browser to scrape them

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
enter selenium

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
everyone's heard of selenium right you

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,199
automate web browsers that's what it

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,120
does it does navigation elements

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,559
runs javascript takes screenshots lots

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,280
of really cool stuff and it works in

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,199
python

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,520
so general recipe you get firefox you

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,600
get firebug you get selenium ide

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
you get python you get python selenium

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
you mix it all together

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,400
pi virtual display is optional if you

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
don't want to actually show the browser

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
on the screen

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
and you install all of that you start up

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,880
firefox and you start recording your

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
session through firefox

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
save that out as a python unit test that

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
you can run

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
you can start asserting things and from

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,600
there you can really start hacking

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,039
around with it and doing some fun things

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,120
so basic recipe record your test

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,320
that's what an example looks like you

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,880
fire up a url

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
you click on some buttons but what about

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
that keypad it

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
changes every time not only that the

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,880
buttons are actually

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,200
images that's not good

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
there's no way to find out really easily

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
what button is the two and which button

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
is the seven so you can press them and

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,080
log in

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,919
so python image library to the rescue

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
using the document object model we know

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
where the buttons are

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,840
we can take a screenshot of the page we

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,000
can crop every single button on the page

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
and fortunately it visually is identical

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
every time a nine always looks like a

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
nine so we hash the image

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,160
and we store that for later and every

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
time we come back we count all the

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,080
buttons again and we figure out where

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,480
the nine is and we press it

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,600
and we're in

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,400
so why do this well there's a geeky

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,039
certain factor to beating this thing but

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,840
it's my data i like data liberation so i

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,520
wanted to graph

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,679
my bank balance and not have to log in

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
myself every five minutes to do that and

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
union's a cool tool for graphing your

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
operating system you can also just write

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
plugins to graph your bank balance

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
that's not my bank balance i don't have

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,780
a gambling problem but i

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,039
didn't want to show you that thank you

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,320
[Applause]

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,120
okay um anders if you can come and set

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,480
up on this one

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,320
over here and josh your time starts

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,320
now hello my name's josh and i'll be

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:28,240
ripping off jonathan colton

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:31,360
code monkey get up get coffee

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
code monkey go to job

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,200
code monkey have boring meeting with

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,360
boring manager rob

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,440
rob say we use only windows for a reason

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,080
no need to think so be a hipster and go

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,280
back to coding in c sharp your monkey

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,600
what do you think i'll code monkey think

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,039
we should be coding in python even

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,559
though the standards and

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,520
code review stuff that we've got says

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,000
donut.net

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,520
code monkey don't say it out loud code

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,140
monkey not stupid just

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,799
cunning

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,360
[Music]

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,080
code monkey downloads ironpython

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,120
codemonkey uses pi2exe

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,679
codemonkey needs a database codemonkey

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,400
gets piodbc

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,400
monkey like you

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,520
codemonkey has to load the budgets out

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,440
of an excel file

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,919
codemonkey finds packages quickly soon

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
work not a pile

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
zoom code monkey has some dbase files

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,080
and he solves that too

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,480
could monkey not worry if python makes

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,320
rob sad he knows what to do

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
code monkey remember what grace hopper

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,520
said it's easier to ask forgiveness than

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
it is to beg permission

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,120
code monkey talks to cereal with ease

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,559
code monkey can even do it in chinese

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,120
code monkey has vb6 code monkey can

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,799
convert it like the best code monkey has

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,200
an api to do everything

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:16,880
and the rest code monkey like you

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,000
thank you

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,919

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,640
district right there

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,919
and uh middle of the coffee groves right

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
doing different projects all this good

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
stuff

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,159
i slipped and fell i became head of a

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,200
clinic and uh

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,400
and clinics have data

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,080
but nobody knows how to use it right and

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
you ask the partners and they don't know

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,960
either right and so everybody puts stuff

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,480
in excel and

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,960
and you can't get any information out

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,640
and bummer so

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,120
it comes python and django so today i

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
want to

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,960
talk about django ford development not

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,799
development as you normally think about

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,200
it but development for

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,480
you know developing countries so one of

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
the great things about django

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,840
is that it's so approachable so i was a

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
bit rusty

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,320
admin saved me you know admin.pi all

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
that good stuff and i was thankful to

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,039
make

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,600
a quick and dirty patient database which

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
is kind of neat

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,559
time goes on and uh find out other

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
people having seen problems with

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,720
information

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,240
yeah so uh actually i wanted to say

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,600
thanks first but i skipped that

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
so i want to say thanks because i'm

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
standing on the shoulders of giants

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
right

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,960
so because uh we have django because

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
django is a great framework and other

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,320
frameworks and get on top of it

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,880
we we and some friends we made our

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
little

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
little organization and we started doing

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,279
different projects one's called bobo

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,520
cafe

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,200
and it uses rapid sms so wrapping sms if

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,480
you're not if you guys don't know

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,799
use pi serial by gsm and you got to talk

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,400
to

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,200
nice little gsm modems like little 3g

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,520
dongles right

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
so because of that we can send messages

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,000
up to a cloud

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
and then rural coffee farmers can send a

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,880
text message

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,880
and find out what the price of coffee is

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,440
and uh that's 36 cents the other project

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,600
that we did with the asian foundation

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,559
was we kind of took a bunch of tools

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,159
mashed them together

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,919
and created hurricane sms which is

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,559
actually a double clickable app

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
that runs on windows and macintosh and

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,400
it uses

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,240
django and or rapid sms

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
yeah but it's a double click google app

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
so you use your nice little 3ds and

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
modem

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
and you use it like an app and you could

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,960
run polls and these were actually used

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,279
in last elections to gather

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,039
uh quick data quick polls at the end of

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
the day to see who's voted and who

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,919
hasn't

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,799
who how many people voted for each party

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,120
yeah

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,400
uh we're doing a bunch of stuff but the

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,600
only reason we can do it is because of

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,080
you guys

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
yeah because of the tools that are

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,559
available and because the community is

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
so supportive

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,679
you know we can actually just jump on

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
github work a bunch of stuff slap it

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,640
together

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
30 seconds and make some really cool

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,679
stuff that actually has an impact

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
on rural people's lives in east teamwork

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,080
so again i just want to say thanks

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,799
yeah uh if you're at all interested in

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
our code

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,159
it's all up on github my email address

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
is that

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,799
and uh shoulders of giants yeah so

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
django community rappresses community

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,400
unicef uganda great stuff

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,840
unicef innovation labs great stuff

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,600
cactus group also cool

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,840
and everybody else uh that's helped

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
right

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,120
so um adam terry is now alex sharp if

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
you can set up over here that would be

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,799
awesome

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
and your time starts now adam if you

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,159
haven't met me before hold it up to you

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
yeah if you haven't met me before my

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,200
name's adam um yesterday

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,360
ivan tear my colleague gave a talk on uh

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,559
templating and particularly diazo now

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,039
one of the the

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,760
questions that came up was is isn't

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,480
diazo

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,960
difficult and yes and no it's a

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
different way of thinking about how you

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,880
theme a website it's kind of like

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,159
middleware so it's in the in between

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,279
your content and what the user sees

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,240
i'm going to try and theme a site to try

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
and prove

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,400
that it is possible in one minute fewer

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,279
than five um so

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,120
do we have this yes okay so i say your

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,120
scenarios you need to retheme

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,760
a conference website like this one

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,200
because it doesn't look so great

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,039
and let's it's a django

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
website what can i say i'm a plone

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,960
developer

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,880
i know i know i know but the phone

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,039
conference site looks much better

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,440
so i'm going to retheme it to this one

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,240
so if i save that

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
uh and i'm going to call it plone dot

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,880
html

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,440
as a web page complete oh i might

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
replace that

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,080
and let's have a look see if that

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,440
actually came up

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
my diazo thing clone there we are and if

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,279
i

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,520
look at that in google chrome

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,760
oh yes i do want to open that thank you

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,760
um

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,600
there it is now so diazo you want to

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,320
relate the elements

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,039
in this in this particular side with the

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,520
elements

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,480
in this uh content so this comes out of

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,799
the content

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
and then you want to relate it to say a

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,520
theme this is a static theme it's got

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,399
its resources

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,080
in that other file called plone files so

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,960
here's the rules file

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,720
and we have two steps we define the

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
theme which is the plain theme.html

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,240
which we just saved

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,080
and then we defined some rules so i have

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,760
some it's a bit like art and craft you

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
cut things out and you put things in so

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
i've got some

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,559
replace statements and some drop

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,039
statements here's an after statement it

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,399
kind of

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,640
grabs something and sticks it after

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:48,080
something else you can use

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,240
xpath like that or you can use

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
css selectors so this is how you're

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,600
selecting things

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
from your content into your theme or if

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
you really like

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,720
you can use xsl um as

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,440
seen there okay so

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,000
now we compile it into xslt uh here

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,120
we're going to compile it into

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,840
ploneconf.xsl like so

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,200
and that should produce our xsl file

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,520
which we don't have to write anymore

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
because

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,919
xsl is really hard and it's annoying

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,200
but you can still use it if you really

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,799
want now

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
we're going to try and serve up the

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,480
plume conference site through the xsl

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,279
so i'm proxy passing the whole pycon

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,960
site

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:38,640
through my xsl right here if we can

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,640
one minute no don't worry set

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
now don't fail me windows azure

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,799
our wi-fi doesn't help with localhost no

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,200
it's my localhost

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,799
and there you are conference website

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
using the static theme that we just

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,799
saved

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,279
including the title the content the news

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,080
items we can click on one i think

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,600
and sponsored down the bottom there you

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,559

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,559
and thank you very much

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,080
okay so um alex sharp is up

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,279

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,279

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
uh and alex your time starts now hey i'm

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
alex i'm here to show you some python

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,320
hacks

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,000
this is not my hack it was a hack i

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,159
think i got it from someone around here

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
last year i'm just putting it back out

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,799
here this

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,399
was it like this oh

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,240
i don't know how to do that quickly um

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,520
control plus yeah

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,279
[Music]

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,880

whoa that's why okay so it's essentially

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,679
something i got over here um

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
it's essentially have you guys used

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,279
signals signals let linux tell your

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,000
process that something's happened

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,720
this one means that well that and pdb

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,480
pdb is the python debugger it's awesome

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,720
this bit of code i got from someone over

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,399
here and that was essentially

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,399
linking the two so you could just go

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,840
through and from one line worth of bash

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,520
poke into your program and just

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,720
instantly get a debugging prompt it's

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,159
awesome

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,679
next bit is alarms because

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,559
things that freeze suck

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,679
so yeah okay i'm gonna keep getting that

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,919
so

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,919
um yeah

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,399
did i just hear that

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,000
seriously when i was at mit i was

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,640
teaching people vim

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
seriously um so just just tell you how

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
much

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,440
how hardcore i am okay signal sig alarm

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,000
you can use sig alarm to kill your stuff

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
if it

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,760
if it freezes that is my gift back to

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,360
you

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,720
now going back um

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
yeah now for other random stuff here is

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
code

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
making more code it's like yeah so he

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
like

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,679
lisp so i put lisp in your python well

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,320
this this is actually production code

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,240
i use this these are web bindings it

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,360
goes from makes a whole bunch of methods

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
because making a whole bunch of

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,559
repetitive methods sucks

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:22,399
um other cool thing is

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,519
dis dis this is cool two minutes

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,399
okay seriously what is

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,760
uncool is resizing stuff resizing stuff

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,399
is uncool

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,880
this is cool this is a module uh import

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
disk

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,000
this will disassemble anything you're

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,720
trying to find

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,240
um another cool thing actually this

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,760
actually isn't cool

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,919
there is something about this that is

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,679
very uncool and i'll show you guys why

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,360
in a second

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,039
okay random function oh okay

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,480
this deals with closures if you're not

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,559
dealing with closures

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,519
um i'm very happy for you uh dealing

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,279
with closures

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,919
is uncool um so here's the thing

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,799
go through i have x x is in a closure i

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,120
can set x

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,120
that's good that works top code works

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,240
middle code works so just saying

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,360
setting x to two works setting a um

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,399
setting x equals x plus one

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,960
oh wait no i got my middle mixed up top

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,360
one

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,640
printing x plus one works setting x to

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,120
two works

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,200
setting x to be x plus one fails

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,320
miserably

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,440
figure that one out um

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,799
yeah oh it's i'm not quite sure i

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,399
brought up on the other one when i had a

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,559
look at the disassembly output it looked

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,080
like i was using the wrong type of store

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,200
uh the other last bit is just a random

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,000
random thing

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,559
which is meta programming so apparently

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,080
new is

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,200
old so new has been replaced by

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,120
new methods in types so you can

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,279
so you should not use the methods that i

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,440
just showed you in my web bindings

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
and you should now be using type start

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,720
method type

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,559
so i'm just showing you this which makes

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,880
no sense as far as

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,480
that screen since it's too small but

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,240
yeah so it's just simply

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,880
hacking with stuff um ten

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
seconds ten seconds oh there was one on

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,200
one

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,240
be quiet everyone six five five

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,039
no apparently not find it oh well

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,880
look inside thank you very much alex up

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,240
next we have nick coughlin um not

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,240
kenneth wright because he didn't

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,519
approach the podium uh david flanders if

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
you can set up here that would be

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,720
awesome

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,080
and nick your time starts now actually

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
i'm only going to give you 30 seconds

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,120
because you've already given that talk

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,799
uh yeah this is me cheating the system

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,799
getting an extra four minutes

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,640
uh so i went through a bunch of the new

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,640
language features coming in 3.3 which is

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,240
due within the next month or so

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,960
i went through these yesterday so i'm

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,000
skipping over them today

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,279
so some stuff in python if you really

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
know what you're doing you can dig into

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,399
callables and find out what their

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
signatures are

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,120
it's actually kind of hard and you're

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
diving into a bunch of implementation

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,880
details

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,519
so 3.3 there's now a nice new supported

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,679
api

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,200
inspect.signature it will tell you

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,760
everything you ever wanted to know and

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,359
never knew existed about callables

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
and will actually let you bind arguments

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,200
without calling the function

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,839
which is great for getting early error

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,800
detection on delayed calls

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,119
which are never going to work because

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,520
the arguments are wrong

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,599
another thing we got is people like

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,040
programming with closures and generators

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,839
one of the complaints about them is that

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,919
unlike a class you can't easily

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,040
get into them and look at the state for

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,960
testing purposes

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,800
well that's wrong you actually can and

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,919
there's now official apis to

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,520
let you do that easily uh one for people

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,960
reporting from python 2 which i briefly

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,079
mentioned yesterday

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,919
uh up until python 3.2 you had to change

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
all your u-literals to get rid of the u

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,000
prefix

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,079
you don't have to do that anymore you

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,119
can just leave them alone

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,679
other than that they're the same as

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,920
string ordinary string literals

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,800
there's a bunch of under the hood stuff

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
so

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
the import system has been awful and

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,599
horrible for years we've survived on it

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,599
for two decades

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,720
but it was uh holding back a bunch of

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,920
stuff

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,800
it's all now written in python it brings

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
in directory caching so it no longer

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,400
stats the world

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,560
when you're importing stuff and is a

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,000
heck of a lot

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,440
ends up being pretty similar in speed um

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,040
there's a bunch of weirdness to do with

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,560
the global import lock which is gone

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,680
sorry not the global interpreter lock

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,000
just the import lock

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,800
there's a bunch of stuff people who are

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,040
used to

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
who like using multi-processing there's

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,440
a bunch of stuff that can't be sent over

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,839
sockets

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,960
because it doesn't have enough name

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,640
information

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,520
uh we've actually started storing all

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,560
that now so in 3.4 you'll be able to

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,920
send all those over sockets and there's

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,440
a bunch of other weird stuff

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,760
in the garbage collector for people

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,880
embedding it and using it for games and

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,480
you need to dig into the guts um

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,599
so yeah there's lots of goodies coming

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,000
in uh 3.3 who missed the lightning talks

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,880
yesterday

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,079
a few people okay so most of you saw it

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,160
for their benefit

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,560
um virtual lens in the core

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,480
hey i have time left uh virtual ends in

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,640
the core uh name says packages so you

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,560
don't need empty init files anymore

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
uh you can delegate to sub iterators

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,200
really easily

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,599
less digging around in erno and a bunch

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,119
of new stuff in the standard library so

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,480
cheers cool um

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,480
is kenneth writes about

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,800
as he's up to do a lightning talk in

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,599
just a tick um so if he's in the hall

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,960
someone going

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,520
get him to do his lightning talk um

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,599
so we have david flanders now if um

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,000
samantha can come and set up on this one

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,760
to

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,760
to present hers and we can start now

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,240
how many people think the cloud is hype

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,599
cool well i think i've got a an

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,119
excellent video here which is actually

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,920
going to disprove all

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,680
all right um so i thought the cloud was

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,800
complete hype and as well uh

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,800
six months ago

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,079
uh that's until i got involved with the

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,720
openstack community

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,560
uh which is uh was quoted by wired as

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,880
being the most important open source

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,400
project of the decade um just to give

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
you some numbers on it originally

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
started with nasa and rackspace

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,880
there's now over 3000 developers

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,079
involved in it

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,079
it uses ec2 and s3 apis so it creates

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,280
competition in the market against aws

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,720
because obviously if you

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
learn how to use these apis and

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,839
libraries and tools you can use either

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,760
competition is a good thing it's in its

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,760
fifth version essex was released

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
they meet every six months in a

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,520
conference the conferences are getting

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,680
bigger and bigger and more important

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,320
in terms of who's being involved so

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,040
there's over 186 companies now involved

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,599
in the openstack movement one minute

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,400
and uh what's exciting is australia's

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,560
leading on this

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,640
so australia government has just funded

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,359
an academic cloud for all researchers so

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,240
if you have a

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,480
edu.au email address you can have two

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,240
free servers right now

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,640
they're expected to have up to 30

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,640
thousand cores in the next four years

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,400
and the point i'm really making here is

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,119
we need more developers to be playing in

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,839
this space

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,040
um it's good it's open uh it's an

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,400
exciting thing to do

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,520
you definitely should be looking at

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,320
tools like salt puppets

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,000
chef and juju and if you're interested

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,200
and i really would love us next year at

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
the next year's conference and you guys

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,800
have done a great job to

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,599
potentially have an openstack meet up

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,359
then so

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,880
thanks everybody come talk to me about

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,119
why the cloud isn't just

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,839
hype and okay uh samantha you

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,359
can present from here

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,280
enrolled in the wrong one but if i could

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,160
borrow a laptop i can show a video for

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,640
one minute um we'll let kenneth do his

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,680
first

00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,240
and um and you can come on later

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,760
just keep things going shall we wait for

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,440
kenneth to connect his laptop or should

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,280
i start the timing now

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,960
or shall we let nick coughlin present

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,320
again

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,320
more python 3.3

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,839
yeah i got a dongle

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,400
yes

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,040
hello excellent hang on this isn't vga

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,160
what is going on here

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,119
is the timer going yeah this is not oh

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,000
what's up

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,839
there's a thingy on it oh yeah sure i

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,359
demand a restart

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,079
hmm all right i'll just keep talking

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,480
so essentially um i'm just going to do a

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,079
little thing

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
about flash real quick a lot of people

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,320
don't know what it is and i just want to

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
give a

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,000
little shout out to what it is in case

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,000
you're interested essentially flask

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,359
is a really cool application framework

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,599
that allows you to

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,119
build http applications in a very

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,520
elegant and simple way

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,040
so it depends on the kind of

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
applications you build if you build a

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,839
lot of django applications you will

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,119
often see

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,800
that uh you know everything is very tied

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,680
to the database for example

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
and uh in general it can be a little bit

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,000
difficult to build

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
i don't need it right cool

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,079
it can be a little bit difficult to

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,440
build uh robust application or

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,960
sorry it's very easy to build very

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,359
monolithic applications that have a lot

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,520
of

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,960
interconnectivity between different

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
things and if you start building things

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,520
that like a service oriented

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,440
architecture where you have different

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,200
web services that start speaking to one

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,560
another

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,319
do you find that django isn't

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,119
necessarily always the best tool for the

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,880
job

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,720
uh so essentially if you were to take

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,520
django and you remove

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,200
all the orms stuff and all of the uh

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,800
orm-specific packages

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,560
that are pre-built that people build and

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
the authentication essentially what

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,200
you're left with

00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,319
is a framework that has

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,839
regex routes plus

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:09,599
a fairly crappy uh templating language

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,599
so essentially flask

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,520
is a really nice templating language

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,560
with a really nice route system and

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,040
that's essentially it

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,440
so it's very simple and it allows you to

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
build

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,000
more flexible applications and uh i

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,599
recommend you guys

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,520
i'll check it out if you're interested

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,760
essentially you know you don't

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,119
people sometimes will knock it a little

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,960
bit because it'll go through and they'll

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,640
be like oh it's really hard to build

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,480
these massive applications with it but i

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,640
think that's more of a feature

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,240
rather than a bug because you shouldn't

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,200
be writing these monolithic applications

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,720
in the first place

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,319
so it also allows you to use actual app

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,920
you know actually uses real imports so

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,079
you just pass references around you

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,280
don't have to use like the

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,839
magical settings file where you have all

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,560
these uh

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,000
strings that are importing your your uh

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,880
other applications and things like that

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,280
and configuration is simply a dictionary

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,599
so

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,440
it's a lot simpler and i recommend you

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,560
check it out if you haven't seen it if

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,680
you're doing service oriented

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,720
architecture

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,240
or uh anything like that it is a good

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,359
tool for the job

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,520
that's it cool okay um

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,800
is the person presenting corporate scum

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,839
i'm sorry scrum

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,359
um around here

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,760
corporate scrum yeah if you can set up

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,520
over there that would be awesome

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
and um yeah samantha uh your time starts

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,400
now

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,040
there we go can anyone hear me

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,319
no red light means it's on oh there we

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,440
go

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,319
um i'm a little bit nervous oh this was

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,680
actually meant to be

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,520
for the uh

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,119
you know first time lighting talk this

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,040
afternoon um

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,359
not really related to python the

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,040
interface was actually created in python

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,640
so it's really cool sorry if you've seen

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,839
this before but robots are cool so you

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,839
can just watch this again

00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:21,630
[Music]

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,630
[Applause]

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
um

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:55,839
no this internet eludes me

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:55,839
yeah maybe it'll work

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,839
it's caching there we go

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:26,360
how do i do that oh

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,360
[Music]

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,240
[Music]

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,680
yeah talk about it well um i i will

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,599
admit i've never written a

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,440
line of python code but i've really

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,560
enjoyed myself over this conference the

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,079
interface was written

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,160
in python as far as i've been told

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,839
but it was really easy to use it was all

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,359
click and drag symbols it was all a

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,400
graphical programming

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,760
uh much like lego mindstorm programming

00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
if anyone's ever used that before

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
um

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,359
start playing music soon we actually

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,079
loaded the music file onto the robot and

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,240
played it

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,760
and played with the programming to make

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,760
it move while it played the music

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,520
yeah and well really robots are cool so

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:47,839
you have to excuse my internet and

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:47,839
competence maybe

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,839
you can see it's got some moves

00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:16,880
[Applause]

00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,880
all right there you go

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,280
okay so uh not me so our final lightning

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,319
talk is on corporate scrum

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,680
scrum's the word isn't it oh scum i

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,400
was okay apparently well i

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,119
start the timer go hello i'm nick

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,720
medibank health solutions just this is

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,319
also not specifically about python it

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,800
was originally birds of a feather but

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,960
we're just

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,440
fully in time um we at medibank

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,240
have got we're doing agile we're doing

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,000
scrum

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,160
some of you most of you probably know

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,839
about scrum the intention was to

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,640
educate those of you who don't a little

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,200
bit that it is actually possible to

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,760
be true to the spirit of open source

00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,920
rapid

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,599
development not letting the business

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,319
tell us how to do our job

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,880
within any enterprise environment such

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,560
as

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,520
medibank for those who haven't

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,079
done any agile before i've got no idea

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,839
about

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,680
scrum basically the idea is we've got

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,760
our agile team our

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,880
scrum team we work in fortnightly

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,640
sprints

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
the business communicates with us

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,200
primarily through a product owner

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,079
who puts together stories which are pure

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,800
behavior

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,240
description no idea about how we do it

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,319
we build up autonomy

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,000
we gain respect through delivering

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:37,520
consistently high quality

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,640
stories behavior there's clear

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,720
separation

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,319
in how we do things i wasn't ready to

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,079
go through all this again i feel like

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:52,000
i've already said this

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:55,040
just a couple of hours ago um

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,040
coming from a small company which was

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,800
initially very agile in a more cowboy

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,480
sense we were bought by a

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,200
larger company but were able to preserve

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,359
the feel through this boundary

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,040
through having this more formalized

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,920
mechanism of separating the business

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,079
from

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,079
the developers we're able to continue to

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,880
demonstrate rapid response

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,599
delivering real value to changing

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
requirements

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,079
always keeping quality and working

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,200
software at the forefront

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,359
as they change their mind about what

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,520
they want that just means we finish this

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,400
move on to that through this we've

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,000
demonstrated

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,160
very efficient work compared to their

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,839
waterfall prints to other development

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,599
teams

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,520
we're gaining respect we've managed to

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,319
encourage a number of developers to come

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,839
back and

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:42,400
expand our team and we have

for next year are going to start at a

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,119
slightly lower level than this year from

a thousand dollars

better conference next year so

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,920

00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,599
better word thank you very much

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,760
it is an investment in the community

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,760
that that

00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,839
that all the organizations have sent

00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,359
people here really do benefit from and

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,200
it will help us put on a much better

00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:11,440
conference for next year

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:15,119
um so now we have a special thanks

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:18,480
first up rest point our venue

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,000
when we first said we were going to run

00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,760
this conference

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,599
we decided the conference was probably

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,280
going to be smaller than last year and

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,960
we put ourselves

00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,400
in the smallest rooms that they had in

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,000
the convention center

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,440
and since then we realized that this

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,720
conference was going to be much bigger

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,839
than we expected

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,040
and they've very much um accommodated

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,880
our needs

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,720
um throughout the last few months in

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,319
helping us grow this conference beyond

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,480
our expectations

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,599
i'm sure you've seen uh the staff from

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,440
here they've put on

00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,200
excellent spreads of food and their

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,240
stuff have been really helpful and you

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,119
very

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,720
very difficult process and richard

group of people who make this conference

um josh depray who ran code wars on

01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,920
friday night i think that was really

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:20,160

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:22,400
of applause as well

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,359
very much behind the scenes uh at the

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,160
conference

01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,039
um but has been helping out with our our

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,680
treasury stuff

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,480
is matthew duracio so give him the round

01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,400
of applause he's up the back here

01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,079
he's made sure that we're in budgets

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,559
that we're hopefully going to turn a

01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,559
profit

01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,160
um which is great he did a lot more than

01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,359
just treasury he's uh helped us oversee

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,520
a lot of our decisions and

01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,400
you know make sure we're not being silly

01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,039
yeah we

01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,000
he has to do that quite often well but

01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,200
he has done it and it's

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,799
been good when he has absolutely okay

01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,520
um so that leads us to the

01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,000
not so big announcement for next year

01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,920
which is

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,920
the conference is being run back here

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,760
again next year because python australia

01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,079
runs on a two-year rotation

01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:09,119
so hopefully we will see all of you back

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,960

01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,839
friends

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,520
we want to grow this conference and make

01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,000
it bigger i'm sure that all of you could

01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,000
convince

01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,359
one other person to travel down to

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,440
tassie for next year

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:23,039
and you know if we can grow this

01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,480
conference by that much it would be

01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,640
amazing

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,920
so yeah um it'll be around this time

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,960
rotation

01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,039

not one of these

01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,760
but you think there should be a python

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,920
users group you really should get in

01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,119
and and do that have a chat to us to see

01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,720
about how we can

01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:52,000
we can publicize that um

01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:55,039
finally uh conference feedback

01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,960
we really really value the feedback from

01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,480
attendees it's the only way that we can

01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,000
know what we're doing wrong

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,640
how we can improve the conference for

01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,640
next year uh how we can sort out issues

01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,559
with venue with food anything that might

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,760

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,119
sent out to you

01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,760

if we do take on an idea

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,359

there is an incentive to sign up

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,480
um also to complete the conference

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,720
survey not just a monetary

01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,599
incentive but also an opportunity for

01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,920
you guys to help

01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,680
grow this conference in the direction

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,799
you'd like to see it go

01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,559
and what you guys like to get out of

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,079
this community right

01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,400
so you'll notice that we didn't have

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,520
many sponsor brochures pieces of paper

01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,359
stuff like that

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,119
on the swag table this year that's

01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,599
because we asked all of our sponsors to

01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,920
send out their collateral electronically

01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,400
um so all the sponsors who sent out

01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,920
brochures and promotional codes

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,079
we're going to be sending those out in

01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,839
an email to you later on this week

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,839
along with the professional delegates

01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,359
listing um

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,200
so that you can find out who the

01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:26,079
professional delegates here were and

01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,680
perhaps get in contact with them we hope

01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,680
you find this particular initiative

01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,359
useful and more useful

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,880
than just having lots and lots of random

01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,240
cards and business cards and pieces of

01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,280
paper that you might lose

01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,359
on your way back from hobart so

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,039
this is the end of python australia

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,559
hobart 2012.

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:57,839
hopefully we'll see you back here next

01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:57,839
