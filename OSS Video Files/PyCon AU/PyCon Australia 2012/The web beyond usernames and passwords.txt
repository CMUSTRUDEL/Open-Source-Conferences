Persona is a new cross-browser login and identity system for the web that is pragmatic, federated, and serves the user.

Unlike other popular solutions, it puts a strong emphasis on privacy protection and makes your browser the trus

thank you so if you've been on a website

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,849
recently which I hope includes most of

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,759
you you've probably seen a screen like

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,619
this right in 2012 that's still the

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,320
dominant way that people log in to

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,600
websites now there are a number of

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,430
things that are wrong with a very simple

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,720
user name and password scheme the people

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,699
use a big problem is security if you've

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,679
been following the news recently you

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,559
will have seen a number of high-profile

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,489
companies apologizing publicly for

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,790
losing passwords from the users after

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,579
getting hacked now I could pick on any

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,010
one of those but the reality is that

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,700
storing passwords in the database is

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,219
actually really hard right it is a

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,370
liability if you if you have a web

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,320
application and in it and it's easy to

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,600
get something wrong now of course you're

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,559
all 500 hours which means you're all

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,510
smart so you know that you have to do a

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,880
couple of rounds on V crypt or even

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,700
better s script for your passwords when

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,170
you hash them you use per user cells and

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,880
you already use a site secret that's

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,790
outside your database now you know all

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,880
of this right so but let's be honest

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,070
about the kinds of passwords that users

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,930
are going to store or going to use on

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,950
your websites right this is a top 500

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,549
passwords the big one there is an actual

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,740
password it is the most popular password

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,170
so they're gonna they're going to pick

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,700
really shitty passwords so people some

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,070
people will be able to crack them or

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,250
guess them or whatever now what's worse

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,710
is that when linkedin gets hacked are

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,750
you going to ask your users to reset

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,070
their passwords because they're using

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,860
the same passwords that they were using

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,189
on linkedin right so it's a bit of

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,259
problem another problem is can has to do

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,479
with conversion right now it's really

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,700
typical when you look at metrics to see

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,799
something like this lots of people

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,679
starting the signup process and not as

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,300
many finishing a sign-up process now

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,300
there's lots of reasons for something

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,640
like this

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,290
and and if you have if you run a website

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,720
you probably know a bit more about it

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,540
but use specific circumstance but a

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,050
large part of this is often has to do

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,590
with you forcing users to pick another

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,810
username another password right it did

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,660
people don't use password managers now I

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,730
know we all do right we all use very

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,410
smart schemes with passwords and we save

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,780
them your browser's encrypted blah blah

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,940
blah but the average user is not that

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,510
sophisticated Mozilla has done users

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,810
research on this and no users don't use

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,480
fancy password managers so this gap

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,710
there when you know they give up because

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,570
they don't want to sign up to your site

00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,330
because I just don't want to remember

00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,060
yet another password this is costing you

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,430
real money so it's another problem with

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,890
this scheme now there are existing

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,920
solutions that are not usernames and

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,460
passwords one very cool one that not

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,770
many people use is client-side ssl

00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,510
certificates now it's just like the

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,020
server-side ssl certificates that you

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,270
use to prove that an https website is

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,420
the one it claims to be except that this

00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,400
is issued to user not a website and it's

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,500
stored in the browser when you visit a

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,750
site that needs it the browser sends it

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,010
over and you login it's just like magic

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,260
it's really great sort of worldwide SSO

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,050
but can I get a quick show of hands how

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,780
many people have used a client's sir

00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,190
it's in the last week to login to

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,360
website that's quite a few people that's

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:53,500
impressive okay last month same people

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,080
okay last year okay few more hands but

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,670
not many right and we're all geeks and

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,060
I'm sure there's a couple of people

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:04,090
probably have CA sert accounts in the

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,250
room but anyways that solution is not

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,989
used very much lots of usability

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,780
problems the support and browser is not

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,200
that great it's hard to set up on the

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,440
server side so let's not talk about it

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,570
too much because nobody uses it now this

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,600
is a solution that's a lot more popular

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,910
you outsource control of your of the

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,080
identity of the users to a centralized

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,319
Authority now Microsoft tried

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,569
back in the days with passport it bombed

00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,860
people freaked out the market the

00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,900
thought that Microsoft might become the

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,520
gatekeeper of the internet but somehow

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,389
things have changed and now it's okay

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,580
when it's these companies now it's not

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,229
really okay because you're cutting out

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,770
users that don't want a linkedin account

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:52,039
or a facebook around the twitter account

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,050
and also you know you may not want to

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,419
give what's most precious so that your

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,550
company is your customers list you may

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,219
not want another company for profit

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,479
company to be in control of that maybe

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,680
you do maybe that's okay for your

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,349
business maybe that's acceptable

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,379
acceptable risk but it's certainly

00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:12,020
unacceptable for the open web to have to

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,930
private for-profit companies be the

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,060
gatekeepers of the internet so what

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,479
about open ID it's going to open in a

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,000
name surely that's a good thing um open

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,659
idea is great because it did bring the

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,719
idea of decentralization back into the

00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:35,539
the realm of web identity unfortunately

00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,270
hasn't had the adoption that people wish

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,060
it had there's various reasons for this

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:44,210
one of which its usability users have a

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,550
hard time figuring out how it works what

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,949
it means it's actually hard to implement

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,539
there's lots of really shitty IDPs out

00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,029
there that will bring up your support

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:56,029
costs if you start using open ID but the

00:05:53,029 --> 00:06:00,560
main problem why we at Mozilla couldn't

00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:02,750
really get behind this is privacy open

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,909
Ozzy has a terrible flaw that's not

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,949
flexible that app the product because

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:08,900
it's at the protocol level basically

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,270
your identity provider gets a trail of

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,960
every website you're going to and that

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,779
to us is unacceptable so we built

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,889
something else something called persona

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,860
and that's what I want to talk about

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:25,879
today now persona is distributed it's

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,919
not centralized it's as decentralized as

00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:31,339
you want it to be you can run beyond an

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,979
IDP if you want its privacy sensitive

00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:36,139
the identity provider does not have a

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,560
trail of every place where you're going

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,820
it cannot have a trail by design it's

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,800
simple both for you

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,110
because we're really focused on user

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,990
experience we have a full time user

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,820
experience designer on our team and it's

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,610
also very simple for developers and I'll

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,200
show you that in just a minute and

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,470
finally like quit everything that

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,210
Mozilla does it's open source okay so

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:07,100
how does it actually work the basic idea

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:09,580
is verified email addresses so your

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,190
username becomes your email address and

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,620
your password instead of a password what

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,440
you provide is a proof that you own an

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,810
email address so email and proof if you

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,110
understand this you understand persona

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,060
it's as simple as that okay so how do

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,730
you get a proof that you own an email

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,330
address you get a proof by going to your

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,310
email address provider so if the email

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,880
address provider supports it you go

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,200
there you login say to your webmail

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,670
using a username and password if it's

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,970
gmail then you might be using a two

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,680
factor auth or whatever then your

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,760
browser generates a public and a private

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,710
key specific to that email account it

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,170
sends a public key over to your email

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,660
provider now that happens transparently

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,120
you don't have to do anything and at

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,700
that point the email provider returns a

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,920
signed copy of your public key back to

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,450
your browser because it knows who you

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,480
are already you're logged into that

00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,510
website so what you have in your browser

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,150
at this point is this a signed statement

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,490
from your provider that you own that

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,070
email address now what can you do with

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:23,960
this you can take it to a website like

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:26,510
123 done org that uses persona 4 logins

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,210
and the way that works is that you click

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:33,080
at the on the Sign In button at the top

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,690
there that brings up a dialog box which

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,270
shows you all of the emails that you

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,030
have proofs for in your browser so I

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,349
have a certificate for these two emails

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,350
i'm going to pick the second one and

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:49,040
click the Sign In button and boom you're

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,110
in no passwords if you have already that

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,900
citic that signed statement in your

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,170
browser you don't need a password to get

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,790
log

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,550
into the website now how would it work

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,639
if a third party sites a Wikipedia

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,769
wanted to add support for persona to

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,250
their system right they wanted to let

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:13,220
people log in using persona well if i

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,100
visit wikipedia and try to login using

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,139
persona i'm going to send you yeah only

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,209
in San Wikipedia an assertion the

00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:24,529
assertion is very simple it's a bundle

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:26,740
three things the signed certificate that

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:31,399
we got from the email provider an

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,589
audience filled and an expiry first

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,079
thing that Wikipedia will check is that

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,449
audience filled audience feel meaning is

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,430
basically the URL of the website were

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:43,190
you trying to log in now the reason why

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,380
you want this in an assertion is that if

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,660
you didn't have that then you then

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,149
Wikipedia could actually turn around use

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,970
the assertion i just gave to it and then

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:56,690
log as myself to into another website

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,490
that won't work because the audience

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,949
Pacific to Wikipedia and that other

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,670
website would see that it's it's the

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:07,370
wrong audience and would refuse entry at

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,800
that point next thing is to check the

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,810
expiry time assertions are valid in

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,170
persona for two minutes so they're very

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,540
very short-lived and if that works then

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,060
let the next thing you do is you check

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,100
the signature on the cryptographic

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,209
certificate that you sent as part of

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,860
your assertion how does that work well

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,079
which video would get the public key

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,360
from gmail it's the same public key for

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,940
every user so you don't have to reveal

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,980
at that point who is trying to login to

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,410
your website you're just getting into a

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,180
generic public key and in fact you

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,709
probably don't even need to get the

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,990
public key fits something like Gmail

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,550
Yahoo Hotmail because it's very likely

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,100
that someone else would have logged in

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,430
before you and wikipedia has just cashed

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,410
the public key so this in this case

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,839
gmail wouldn't even have an accurate

00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,519
count of how many users Wikipedia users

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,649
use Gmail and once you've checked all of

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,720
that then that's all you need to do they

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,910
use it you can log the user in using

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,650
whatever normal mechanism you use

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,870
setting a cookie creating a session

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:16,430
whatever you do from there on this it's

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:19,670
the whatever the site does normally okay

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,910
so how much work is it to do what I've

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:26,000
just shown right how much code do you

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:29,450
need to write the answer is about 75

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,420
lines of code that is the a very minimal

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:36,410
Python CGI that i wrote 75 lines and

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,330
that included HTML the client-side

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,220
JavaScript code as well as the backend

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,150
Python code so it's really very little

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,880
code let's look at that site again and

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,550
look at what sort of code we would

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,620
expect to see now when I click what was

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,070
the first of all when I load this page

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,800
one thing that happens is that this is

00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,680
in the header so there's an external

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,480
piece of JavaScript from persona org

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,090
that gets loaded from the header that's

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,370
the first thing you need to do then you

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,100
need to run the navigator that idea

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,560
watch setup function this does three

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,200
things first thing it tells this it

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
turns persona whether or not there is a

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,300
user currently logged in to your site

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,330
and who it is so in this case I didn't

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,130
email address like this well no like

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,610
right now on that site is nobody login

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,040
so no no would indicate that then you

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,410
have an on login function that you need

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,050
to specify this is what gets cold when

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,480
this user hands an assertion over to the

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,000
site I'll just skip that for a bit and

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,580
come back to it the last one is a logout

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,280
function so this is how if you if

00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,040
persona wants to log a user out of your

00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,630
sight how does it work typically you

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,190
redirect to the log out page and then

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,870
the backend will kill the session and

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,370
remove the cookie something like that so

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,220
this is what this is doing is just a

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,970
redirect but you do whatever you need to

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,360
do on your site so okay now if I click

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,550
on a son in button what happens is that

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,860
the browser will call navigator that ID

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,540
that requests with no parameters so

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,180
you're free to use whatever sign-in

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,370
button you want or link or whatever but

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,170
you need to call this function because

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,600
that's a function that brings up the

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,350
dialog with the list of certificates

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,020
that are all

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,540
in the browser so i'm going to pick the

00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:30,080
same email that used for click Sign In

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:34,400
and that's when the login function gets

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,840
a call with the users assertion okay so

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,900
what do you do with it with the

00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,480
assertion well this is harry didn't in

00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,120
jquery you can do it in many ways but

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,560
this is basically just taking the

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,610
assertion from the user and passing it

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,510
back here to the backend at this URL

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,480
slash log in and then once we're done we

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,760
just redirect back to the homepage ok

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,830
simple enough now the important thing

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,370
here is that you do need to verify

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:10,250
assertions server side because you can't

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,440
trust the client to do that properly so

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,300
you just post it back to your own

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,170
website and this is the client-side code

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,880
so very simple that's all you need to do

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:23,000
uses a Python request module but you can

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,920
use whatever you want to do this but the

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,810
the important part here is that you're

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,420
taking the assertion from the user and

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:32,360
sending it to verify or login the

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,990
persona don't work with the audience

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,550
feel that you expect what you get out of

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:44,210
this post to persona org is a love a

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,600
blob of JSON that will say either status

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,390
ok if it's a valid assertion or else a

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,360
status failed if it's invalid if it's

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,820
valid you will then get the email at the

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,940
bottom right you know France wat mozilla

00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,900
com if you Fitz invalid you don't get

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,830
the email you get an error message

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,020
instead so when you get that then you

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,330
can just go ahead and login the user log

00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,930
views in because the assertion is valid

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,940
everything is fine the last piece of

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,420
course is what happens when the user

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,670
clicks the logout button at the top

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,950
there and it's quite simple you just

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,190
call and call this function navigated a

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,060
tidy that log out no parameters and and

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:32,300
then the user will be logged out fully

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,490
like this and that calls of course the

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,770
callback that

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,220
mentioned earlier the whole knockout

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:42,430
function so that's it that's all you

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,510
need to do to add persona support into

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,140
your application like I've actually

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:49,270
shown you literally all the code loaded

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,630
an external javascript file set up the

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:56,470
login logout callbacks add the buttons

00:15:52,630 --> 00:16:01,089
and then verify the assertion server

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:04,060
site now what's the status of persona

00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:06,430
how decentralize is it right now for

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,839
example um it's a tricky question

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,570
because when you're dealing with

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,760
decentralized services it's really hard

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,820
to get started if you want to start

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,930
fully distributed right from the start

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,570
well it's probably not going to work and

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,970
the reason for that is that you need the

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,310
cooperation of a whole lot of people and

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,350
every single one of them will ask you

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,410
well how many people are using this you

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,170
know how many IDPs you have how many all

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,779
of these questions and if you wait if

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,180
you if you're waiting on everybody to

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,250
get together and just you know start

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,010
then it'll be a little bit like ipv6

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,890
right everybody will wait until they're

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,020
forced to do to do it so what we've done

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,209
is we've and I think that's one of the

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,730
most clever things about persona is that

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,250
we've built centralized fallbacks for a

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,890
lot of things to help with this initial

00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,779
adoption thing first place where we

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,390
build a centralized fallback is with the

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:04,300
identity provider now what you want to

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,780
see normally is this you have an email

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,179
address like Francois at ide and you

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,490
want to see assertions and certificate

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,740
well certificates that are issued by ID

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,010
dot neat right issuer ID not me that's

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,640
the ideal case the the domain issues

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:25,420
certificates for its users what we've

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,309
built however is a fallback IDP to work

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,320
around the fact that not all the mains

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:32,440
right now in fact very little domains

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,630
right now support persona natively so

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,780
what you're going to see if you instead

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,510
of seeing this when you use a domain it

00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,640
that doesn't have ironically enough this

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,580
one doesn't have persona support yet but

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,240
it will have it will very soon and the

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,100
code is there it's just not rolled out

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:55,010
and what you're going to see instead is

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:59,630
this issuer login persona work okay that

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:02,660
means that person org is vouching for my

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,330
ownership of that email address now how

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,790
can we do this if we if we're not

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,130
related to these domains we do what

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,410
everybody else on the internet does to

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,210
prove it to check it you own an email

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,610
address we send you an email of

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,970
registration time and it has a unique

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,470
link with a token in it when you click

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,780
on it that proves to us that you own

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,020
that email address right everybody else

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:30,730
does that so at that point we can sign

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,230
certificates on your behalf if your

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,900
email provider does not support persona

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:39,320
natively if it does then our fallback

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,809
does not get used so right now we

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,730
support all email providers they all

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,250
work with persona because of that fall

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,150
back now the second thing is browser

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:54,559
support ultimately what we ought to see

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:56,090
is this navigator ID dot whatever will

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,480
be part of browsers it will be a

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:03,380
standard feature and everything will be

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,780
great now right now there are no

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,350
browsers that support this natively so

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,660
what what did we do we did this that

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,700
javascript file is actually a full

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,390
JavaScript implementation of persona

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:22,940
that works on all reasonable browsers

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:25,210
and I'll get to that in a minute so what

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,380
this means is we don't have to wait for

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,929
browser vendors to actually get around

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,900
and implement things before we can start

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,429
using it it does support all modern

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,850
browsers that's what we support right

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:40,610
now so and we actually test regularly

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,300
with all of these and it works really

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:47,390
well so again it doesn't neat thing

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,490
about persona you don't have to to wait

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,370
until everybody gets together implus

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,770
standard it works right now and as soon

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,480
as browsers have add native support then

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,960
the javascript stuff will just not get

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,040
used anymore also works on iOS and

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,240
Android

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:07,780
all of these browsers now the last step

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,910
where we have a centralized piece is

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,890
with the assertion verification now you

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,160
will notice that we use verifier the

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:19,520
persona org for verifying assertions

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,420
that is of course a single sort of point

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,940
of failure single server that people use

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,980
the idea is that people will will

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,660
validate assertions themselves in the

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,660
future but we want to make it really

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:36,050
easy for people to get started so this

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:38,240
is why we provide the verifier in Python

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,610
you're lucky because you can already use

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,450
a library that will do the verification

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:48,470
entirely on your side without problems

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,450
now if you use PI rasyid I should have

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,180
mentioned browser ID is the name of the

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,490
protocol behind persona any in that

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,710
project used to be called ready now the

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,270
project is called persona but there's

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,980
lots of things that are that they're

00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:05,060
called browser ID because they refer to

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,890
the pro to the protocol currently we do

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,680
suggest that people use the online

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,420
verifier that we provide just because

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,750
we're still changing the details of the

00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,310
crypto underneath the underneath the

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,080
service and if you use the online

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,360
verifier you're not you're not going to

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,940
see any change that's that's that's

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,710
going to be stable if you if you verify

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,810
assertions yourself you may need to make

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,740
adjustments or we may need to just keep

00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:33,920
that library up-to-date in other words

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,450
persona is open for business I mean you

00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,610
can use it on your site now it's ready

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,830
it's used in production in a lot of

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,550
places it's used on most Mozilla

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,890
properties now and it would be great if

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:48,620
you if you joined us now if you have any

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,120
questions feel free to grab me any time

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,280
during a conference or the morning happy

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,860
to talk to you about it and especially

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,840
if you can tell me if there's anything

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,870
we could do that would make it easier on

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,150
you or or would make it more likely to

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,680
be adopted by you whatever please

00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,390
saucony that's exactly the kind of

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,760
feedback we want to get we're very

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,190
committed to making this a part of the

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,530
open web and we'd like it succeed I will

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,350
be at the Sprint's on Monday and Tuesday

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,039
so if you want

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,169
any help adding support for it on your

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,299
sides of your application I'll be one

00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:25,720
happy to do this and the last thing I'm

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:29,020
going to point out is this thing here if

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,929
you're using Django there's an off

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,250
plug-in already for browser ID persona

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,140
so you don't even need to write any code

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,340
you just turn it on the networks and

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,440
it's brilliant so Eddie any questions

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,110
yeah if he can wait for the microphone

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,490
we're just going to run it around um

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,490
yeah it's about 10 minutes for questions

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,620
so it looks pretty good but my first

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,780
question about our identity really is

00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,280
that people have multiple passwords for

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,909
a reason to have different levels of

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,830
security so for a banking website you're

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:09,070
going to have a different identity to

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:12,309
your to your social identity so how are

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,690
you going to solve that problem the

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,120
quick answer to this is that you can use

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,919
different email addresses you can have a

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,710
high security one that you only use for

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,110
your bank with a different password and

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,870
you can have a you know a low-security

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,659
one if you if you want to use in other

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,340
places that's one of the reasons why we

00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,580
went with email addresses I think people

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,080
are know how to provide fake email

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,059
addresses or website you know or like

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,860
fakers and you know just created one on

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,110
gmail and you've never used it anywhere

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,200
else or you put a little plus sign with

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:48,150
other stuff at the f words so you can

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,150
all do that with persona

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,750
hi there um yeah you went through a lot

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,310
of detail about what it's like to

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,540
implement as a developer and I

00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,560
understand as the developer conference

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,140
so it's kind of stuff we want to know

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,470
but I kind of felt that we're missing

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,000
the warts in all version of what it's

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,010
actually like for someone to use a site

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,860
that uses this that hasn't used it

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,940
before because things like open ID it's

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,620
not just hard to implement the

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,270
developers it's just annoying for users

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,370
as well and some of that stuff felt a

00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:20,110
little bit the same as open ID might end

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,520
up being as in what do you get

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,800
confronted with when you first hit a

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,140
site that uses this and what's that kind

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,060
of that initial rollout okay let's let's

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,040
try and use persona and I don't know I

00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,930
just got the feeling that I didn't get

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,460
enough of a description what that looks

00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,610
like thanks that's very good feedback I

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,190
mean I can describe it in sort of broad

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,720
strokes they you you hit the first so if

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,100
you don't have a personal account you'll

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,650
need to create one at some point right

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,420
that's on actually that's not entirely

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,310
true that's only true if your email

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,900
provider doesn't support persona already

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:55,660
if it does then it's a different flow

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,850
right now we have sort of small people

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,670
there playing with it and we have ID me

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,430
which is a demo one that we that we have

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:06,490
but very soon we're ruling out we'll be

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,190
rolling out a sort of proxy system that

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,010
will enable anybody with a hotmail gmail

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,320
and yahoo account to not have to have a

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,910
persona account so they will just log in

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,060
with their gmail password but the normal

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:26,260
flow if you have say I don't know kogan

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:29,590
com email address is you hit the site

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,360
that uses persona click Sign In and then

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,840
you type in your email address say hey

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,610
I've never seen you before please create

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,950
well I'll create a new account for you

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:41,500
so you enter your password in in that

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,080
form twice right the cool thing then you

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,710
get an email the confirmation link that

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,960
I showed and you click that and then you

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,050
sign it automatically your browser will

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,060
redirect automatically to the to the

00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,999
homepage of the site you were trying to

00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,089
sign into also a loser

00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:02,579
sign up password that's an if you if you

00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:04,499
don't have support name I get in your in

00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:10,139
your email provider then you have to

00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:11,549
pick a persona password yeah but so

00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:13,019
that's the flow currently we're

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,059
constantly changing it to make it better

00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,879
so you know if anybody has feedback

00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:20,579
about what they what they see working

00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:24,359
this is based on sort of experiments

00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,919
that we've made with people if you

00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,829
wanted to use it say as an enterprise

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,019
single sign-on type solution presumably

00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:33,149
you'd want to a restricted to just that

00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,729
one sort of email domain you'd have to

00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:37,649
implement the email part so it's very

00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:39,539
easy to do it's when you receive the

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:41,279
assertion you check to the name of the

00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,229
email address if it's not part of your

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,619
of the domains that you have a new white

00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:50,159
list you don't let the user so doing the

00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:52,229
email part is hard or not hard it's easy

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,329
but it's outside of persona like when

00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:56,699
you receive the assertion you verify the

00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:58,259
assertion and that that pics that

00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,179
essentially extracts the email address

00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,279
out of it so at that point in your

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,259
application you can see you can you can

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,629
look at the email and see oh that's not

00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,669
actually an email from the one of the

00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:11,029
company domain are not going to let the

00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:13,799
user in so you can easily do that

00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:17,879
yourself and then there are people doing

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,379
that exactly that so does this work

00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:21,329
outside the browser can I write a

00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:22,979
command line tool that uses this or

00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:25,919
would you still want to use OAuth for

00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:29,129
that it doesn't currently work for on

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,239
the command line just speak that I

00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:37,259
actually want to play with it and do it

00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:39,899
for for testing purposes but what we

00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:43,949
would need to do there is we need to to

00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:46,439
commit to so that I have a way of have a

00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:47,609
way of doing it that I thought of but we

00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:49,889
would need to commit to that specific

00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:52,829
API if there's enough demand we might do

00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:55,649
it but right now you know the first

00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:57,919
thing we'll get we're doing is the web

00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,919
stuff

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:07,060
what's required for implementing the

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,310
issue aside so if you want to add so if

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,340
you have an offering usual service and

00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:15,580
you want to set up that side is what's

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,680
required for that so there's the first

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,350
thing is you need to expose to the world

00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,780
that you support persona currently

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,050
that's so you own the domain you to

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,600
serve a file out of over https while out

00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:32,520
of the dot well-known directory that and

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:37,510
that file will have your public key and

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:40,720
then basically you have these two to

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:43,360
provisioning endpoints that are that you

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,340
need to respond to one peep because

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,600
persona will actually ping you on those

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,610
ones one of them is it was like sort of

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,530
getting an assertion for the user and

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:58,630
the other one is is a login form that we

00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,340
will put it as I can I frame or

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,870
something like that that will display to

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,240
the user so if you provide those two

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,820
things you can do that if you interested

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,370
in that come talk to me we have we have

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,100
a demo IDP that sort of it obviously

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,690
open source Alfred's available and do it

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,000
but yeah like it that I think that

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,360
that's a very good point and in a lot of

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,210
ISPs could benefit from offering like

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,310
awesome sort of native persona support

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,310
through their users yep sounds good

00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,929
there's a question there yet there's

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:41,700
time for one more question so all right

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:44,309
yep we have one more I think that but

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,620
okay yeah I have a comment and a

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,690
question so I tried out persona so I

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,000
went to muscle person aside Nate took me

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,610
to open photos of me and I chattin there

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,960
i went to send in persona and first of

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,149
all the phrasing was really weird so at

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,490
first when I went sent persona asked my

00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:02,100
email I tapped it end and said give us a

00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,899
password and it didn't make it clear

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,909
what password had wanted it kind of

00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:07,620
sounded like it wanted my gmail password

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:09,389
because it didn't say create new

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,250
password there was no confirm password

00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:12,830
box either and I wasn't comfortable

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,269
typing in my gmail password Donna

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,760
non-gmail page so i put in a one-time

00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:20,250
thing and that went through and sort of

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,809
then that logged in and i still haven't

00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,630
gotten a verification email of any sort

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:26,519
all the logan was successful and so

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,309
that's my comment that that process was

00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,289
a bit weird and my question is when does

00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:33,210
that password come into play when will

00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:36,000
ever be asked for that password so that

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,440
will password will show up if you saw if

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,419
you clear your cookies for example in

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,460
your in your browser and you try to log

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,529
in again to that same site or any site

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,049
that users persona then when you type in

00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:47,639
your email the instead of asking you for

00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:49,620
two passwords like you know the

00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,320
confirmation and stuff it will ask you

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,600
just to log in again 22 unlock to

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,750
basically get the certs back into your

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,220
to your browser so if you don't if you

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,019
as long as you keep your cookies then

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,620
you know you're going to be able to log

00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:06,419
into persona but if they expire or are

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,950
you clear though then you'll have to

00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,539
type in the password again and how come

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,730
it was comfortable enough to sort of

00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:14,820
make a successful login without

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:19,110
verifying anything about the email i'll

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:28,250
have to see what you did because i'm not

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:28,250
quite sure the it's there

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,649
yeah well I mean you don't want to

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:37,289
verify your email every single time you

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:39,000
trying to log into a website though sure

00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:40,620
I guess we could do that there will be a

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,270
trade-off but you know if people use

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,140
multiple devices there might be pretty

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,330
annoying because they'll have to

00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,590
constantly click on email links yeah

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,640
we're going to have to cut it off there

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,500
but if you want to speak to France

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,169
flight later on you can you can talk

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,630
about that yeah what do you uh thank

00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,340
Francois for coming today and giving us

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:03,210
this great talk I was actually quite

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,909
interested in it as well so yeah no I

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,399
also have to also have some coffee and

00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:10,140
an iced coffee mug to go with it this is

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,149
our african swallow blend which you've

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,490
