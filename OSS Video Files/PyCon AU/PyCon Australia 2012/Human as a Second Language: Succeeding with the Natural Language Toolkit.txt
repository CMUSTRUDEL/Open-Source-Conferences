okay yes hi everyone as my hand the

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,700
assistant has said I'm the lease and

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,820
i'll be talking today about the natural

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,870
language toolkit which is acronym de zen

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,000
ltk looking at my lovely intro slide you

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,070
might notice two interesting things the

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
second of which is that I've amended my

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,300
subtitle with the word and failing this

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,220
is just basically an ass covering

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,109
exercises I was looking over my slides

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,359
last night and I thought hmm I'm

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,579
actually showing quite a few examples of

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,559
how things can not work when you're

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,079
using a natural language toolkit but I

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,329
think that's good because what I've

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,579
gathered from doing a bit of reading

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,079
here and there is that a lot of the time

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,910
when people are using this they

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,500
generally need to know why things are

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,020
not working as well as where things are

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,969
working and of course the first thing is

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,270
the title which is obviously just me

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,800
being a bit smart because as much as

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,510
we'd like everyone to believe that we

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,850
program before we could communicate with

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,710
other humans it's just not true unless

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,589
maybe we're building cheering machines

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,990
with our blocks or something but I think

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,520
it's an interesting point because so

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,830
I'll start with the question why might

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,479
human language manipulation be difficult

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,250
for the average tech person and so

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,650
programmers they tend to be I think

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,860
drawn to logic and concrete situations

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,560
over feelings and abstractions so you

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,840
like 0 or 1 rather than like the word

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,310
maybe but i like the word maybe because

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,750
it scares scientists and so following on

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,530
from this we like to produce things

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,270
rather than producing ideas so we really

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,810
like to write the code but nobody really

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,380
wants to do the documentation

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,810
historically male-dominated field so you

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,540
know obviously will like the same things

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,390
boys and girls but I think in my

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,759
interactions with all the guys that I

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,009
know her programmers I think there's a

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,750
little bit of a difference in how we see

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,040
things in the perspective we bring so

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:08,039
basically girls are awesome yeah and so

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,140
I think most importantly there's a real

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,459
disincentive to learn to be creative

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,350
with human language if you're a

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,210
programmer

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,920
do a bit of creative writing and I find

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,840
that if I spent too much time in that

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,880
mindset it's sometimes a little bit hard

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,550
to get into the programming or technical

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,440
writing mindset so some people can

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,270
switch really easily and obviously

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,670
there's creativity and programming but

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,700
it can be slightly different and so

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,320
there's that challenge so natural

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,540
language toolkit as you would expect

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,830
from a tool kits it brings together a

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,990
whole bunch of different tools and

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,240
resources that enable you to play around

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,980
with language and so in this way it kind

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,680
of bridges this gap between science and

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,080
art but as with everything in life you

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,960
only get what you give so you need to

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,670
know what to ask it to do it's going to

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,860
be fairly inaccessible to anyone who

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,320
doesn't know how language is put

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,270
together on the basic high school sagent

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,130
even if you're someone like me who is

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,610
pretty good with language in general but

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:09,090
is not you know a linguists sometimes

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,010
it's just utterly baffling so I'm going

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,110
to start by describing a few language

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,520
features that are important when you're

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,670
playing around with natural language

00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,890
toolkit first one being stop words stop

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,290
words I think are really cool basically

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,710
they're all those words like and the a

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,990
or usually very small words if you had a

00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,250
document and you counted up the numbers

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,020
of all the words in it these are the

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,030
words that would end up being the most

00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,650
common but other than telling you what

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,250
language the document is in they won't

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,360
tell you much about it so whenever

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,540
you're trying to construct some kind of

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,670
language for a word frequency thing you

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,610
want to go through and take out all of

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,800
these words first and so this is how you

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,930
do it in the natural language toolkit

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,530
you have this thing called the word

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,020
tokenize which is going to appear later

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,990
and we have a sentence and you'll see at

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,800
the end the words oven these and we'll

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,840
have disappears although when you have a

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,530
stock word lists there's not one

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,450
absolute lists every project might need

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,160
a slightly different list and I'm

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,540
personally when I ran this I was

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,299
assuming that the word sum would also

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,370
disappear because that's a fairly common

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,370
and not particularly lumen ating word

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,660
then we have parts of speech this is

00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:33,900
this is the high school English stuff so

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,849
you have nouns which are just all the

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,740
words that describe things so if you're

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,190
thinking of nouns that were to describe

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,090
me I might be a girl programmer Python

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:50,280
goddess if that's not too much then you

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:53,610
have then you have objectives and

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,340
adverbs which descriptive words a lot of

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,229
them end in ly in a lot of cases there

00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,819
was you can take out of a documents and

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:01,259
you won't really lose much of the

00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,250
meaning in fact it might actually

00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:08,159
improve it and finally you have verbs

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,620
and I like verbs because courtesy of my

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,909
high school days I have this little

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,560
regular expression replacer in my brain

00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:15,630
whenever I see the word verb it's

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,380
automatically translated to doing words

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:22,169
so I know those really well and you'll

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,210
notice I put these little letter keys

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,099
after each of these language features

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,930
and these are the things that you'll see

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,729
come up in the natural language toolkit

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,190
when you try to tag things for parts of

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,560
speech there's a lot more than just

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,949
these ones there's loads and loads of

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,300
them which is really frustrating but

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,240
these are the basic ones that I'm going

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,569
to play with and then you have this cool

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,340
thing called stemming so back to the

00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,400
whole language frequency analysis things

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,050
supposing you have some documents and

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,279
you know that if you explore it it's

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,919
going to tell you about different things

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,469
that people like and say a whole bunch

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,630
of people in document have expressed

00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:02,159
that they like to fly first thing you

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,000
might think is well what have they been

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:08,490
smoking but that's not in what you're

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
trying to discover so you have this

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,759
other problem some of the people will

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,080
say I like to fly that's all very well

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,779
some other people might say I like

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,909
flying and there'll be one or two people

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,979
that might say oh I flew home last

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:26,520
weekend and I really enjoyed it it's my

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,469
favorite thing so when you're pulling

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,569
out all these words you might end up

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,210
with three different ways that people

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,699
are saying they like to fly that should

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,039
actually be categorized together and so

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,150
stemming gets you back to this root word

00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,280
fly

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,960
so that you can collect all this

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,120
together and here's an example of this

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,860
but as you will see it doesn't quite

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:54,930
work which is great this is this is

00:06:49,860 --> 00:07:00,090
called a feature but with some words it

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,160
will work so we also have this other

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,140
thing called Lema cessation which is

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,730
sort of a synonym for stemming accepts

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,440
that when you do it you'll actually get

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,240
a real words mind you it's not actually

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,780
the same root word but it's actually a

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,270
word so you know if you need a word

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,770
that's the way to go so from this you'll

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,630
gather that these concepts are really

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,520
cool but sometimes the tools you have

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,170
available i'm not going to do what you

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,860
want them to do what you expect them to

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:32,130
do so another natural language

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,300
processing concept is training data this

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,880
is a big thing in artificial

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,340
intelligence so the idea is that with

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,140
sufficient previous data a system can

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,230
make some guesses about future data that

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,210
it hasn't yet seen so its intelligence

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,640
through patterns in the data rather than

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,970
through rules that you've hard-coded

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,800
yourself and natural language toolkit

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,170
pulls together a whole bunch of

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,660
different training data sets that have

00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,070
been created by other people one of

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,710
these you've already seen which is the

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:06,180
stop words thing all the stop words sets

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:08,970
a corpora as they're called or corpus in

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,800
the singular some of the other corpora

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,320
that are available through the natural

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,090
language toolkit are one that has a

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,450
great big list of English language words

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,430
and also words in other languages

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:23,250
there's also boys names and girls names

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,620
some of these may be tagged for parts of

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,450
speech others may be divided up into

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,430
separate documents and through the

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,010
natural language toolkit interface you

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,010
can search through these titles and they

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:39,570
used as keywords so that you can

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:42,630
subdivide the corpora then we have word

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,150
net which is more of a dictionary than

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,570
training data but I think it's really

00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:50,460
cool because it's a dictionary that is

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,320
firstly as you would expect from a

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,070
dictionary readable by humans so you

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
have diction

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,740
definitions so here you see one that is

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,720
for the word animal but as well as this

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,390
it's readable by systems so if you look

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,320
at the second example you get this name

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:12,390
which is animal and 01 and one thing

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,980
that you can tell from that is from the

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:20,220
end that this is a noun there may

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,040
actually be versions of animal that are

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,510
not nouns I haven't actually tested this

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,400
but I would imagine that there's another

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:30,420
version of animal that's actually a verb

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,530
so if you notice we've collected the

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,970
definition for the animal at index 0 so

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,150
if we looked at one we might get one

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,200
that's an objective not a verb pretend

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,700
like I actually know what I'm talking

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,650
about okay it's a bit of a stretch

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,180
anyway onto tokenization which is

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,010
something that you can do through the

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,510
built in Python libraries to a certain

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:56,790
extent it's basically the idea that you

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,940
have a whole bunch of text and you want

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,350
to break it up into little smaller bits

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,800
that make sense for whatever you're

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,880
trying to do so here's this being done

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,670
with just the string split method so you

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,380
have your sentence you run split on it

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,090
and which means it will automatically

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,580
split on all the spaces if you don't

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,180
give it any other parameter and so now

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,650
you have a list of all the words this is

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,380
how we do the same thing through the

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,790
natural language toolkit and isn't it

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,170
great you get to import something

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,500
additional for the privilege of doing

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,180
this but you'll notice that the slight

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,780
difference here is that your question

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,890
mark also becomes a separate word this

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,860
is one of these other wonderful things

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,770
that you have to check out to see where

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,570
your punctuation goes and you can also

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,390
do things like paragraph tokenization

00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,020
and sentenced tokenization which is

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,720
shown here so it's not so obvious on

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,880
this example which I made very short so

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,890
it would fit on the slide this if you

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,810
had multiple sentences they would each

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:05,940
be an item in this list so the final

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,780
concept i'm going to talk about is

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,970
wonderfully

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,620
spice of life it's probably pretty

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,380
obvious from all the previous slides

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,360
this if you want to count with a

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,970
solution to a problem there's going to

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,280
be multiple outputs and you have so you

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,960
have to look at the output you're

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,320
getting understand what's going to

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,360
happen and how to cover for it so here's

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,620
three different word tokenizer that are

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,860
provided through the natural language

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,380
toolkit so created an instance of each

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,900
of them in turn and run it through this

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,050
sentence which has a lot of apostrophes

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,750
in it just for fun and as you'll notice

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,820
sometimes the apostrophes with one part

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,880
of the word sometimes the apostrophes er

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,980
with the other sometimes the full stock

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,440
gets to party on with one of the words

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,740
most of the time it gets to be alone so

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,900
you just basically need to know how

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,940
these things are going to work again if

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,450
you're doing some kind of word frequency

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,770
analysis you might find that the most

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,240
common things in your document are a

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,220
whole bunch of stop words and a whole

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,640
bunch of full stops which isn't going to

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,140
tell you very much so possible

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,210
applications from the natural language

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,770
toolkit because it's really cool but you

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,920
might sit there going well what do you

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,690
do with it the thing that I've sort of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,420
been talking about with all these

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:28,770
document analysis examples is sentiment

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,530
analysis or opinion mining which most

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,480
importantly enables people to generate

00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,600
more targeted verse because we all love

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,880
advertisements right other things that

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
you can do are establishing patterns in

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,420
the language that's used by an

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,040
individual's to make guesses about the

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,200
person who's talking this is something

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,750
that was a big deal when i was doing uni

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,190
we all go on these sites there we go we

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,810
can guess your gender from things you've

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,130
written and we try to fool them and

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,200
frequently we wouldn't which was a

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,750
little disturbing you could also do

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,330
things like age identification maybe

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,760
people who use the word groovy a lot and

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,740
that speech from some other century and

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,750
people who

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,290
right and people who use the word like a

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,180
pretty much everyone on the planet

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,900
there's also something that I haven't

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,880
really explored but you can tie the

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,410
natural language toolkit inserts a

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
beautiful soup which is another really

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,250
cool Python tool that's out there to do

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,470
some interesting things with HTML

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,000
parsing but the thing that I've bolded

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,050
because it's my favorite thing ever is

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,690
creating chat BOTS so a basic chat bot

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,760
is something that you can create through

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,520
a lot of training data or and a lot of

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,530
hard-coding a really good example of a

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,160
chat bot that's online is the Alice bot

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:49,060
which has a lot of training data stashed

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,740
in its little xml files and presumably a

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,480
bit of hard-coding went into putting all

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,050
that in the right places works really

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,180
well you can talk to it forever or you

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,750
can engage in a little bit of clever

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,820
programming so how many people here have

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:08,440
either played with analyzer bot or may

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,180
be implemented their own yeah not very

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,850
much code is it and it does something

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,120
that's freak frequently cool and makes

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,570
you want to keep talking it's a pretty

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,160
interesting stuff and the other big

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,290
thing of course is how much time do you

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,570
want to spend on your chat BOTS when I

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,160
was putting together the code for this

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,610
it was more how much time do I have to

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,930
talk about it which is not very much so

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,420
that limited the scope of what I wanted

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,700
to do here's the part where you get to

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,010
meet my chat bot although i will say

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,580
that it's not specifically a chat bot in

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,840
that it doesn't talk back to people it

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,930
kind of is obsessed with a particular

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:51,070
topic and we'll go on about it and may

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:54,760
or may not notice what you're doing it's

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,220
a self-obsessed bot and so when this

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,960
came about was that about a year ago my

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,000
boyfriend decided to perform sentiment

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,590
analysis on my Twitter accounts he

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,240
didn't ask permission I thought that was

00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,160
a bit low so I've just kind of been

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,310
waiting for a chance to get back in him

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:15,759
and so now this exists

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,930
isn't it wonderful anyone who happens to

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,639
be sitting on a computer that's

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,529
internet-connected can probably tweet it

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,939
and see if it will respond I'm not sure

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:25,930
if it's actually running or if it's

00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:28,720
exploded but hopefully it hasn't it's

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,519
pretty groovy isn't it that picture is a

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:37,449
Pokemon there's two ice cream stuck

00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:39,069
together anyway so good thing about chat

00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,779
BOTS these days is that you can use an

00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:43,870
existing web interface you don't have to

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:46,750
code your own interface you can plug all

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,319
the logic into Twitter and Twitter does

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,420
this fire this thing called off so the

00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:54,069
idea behind this is that you can do

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,389
things on behalf of an account without

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,959
having to know the username or password

00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,120
you do this thing that that's really

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,810
charmingly known as the dance which is

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,610
incredibly annoying the main point of

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,129
importance here is that last thing

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,129
secure equals true everything on twitter

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,959
has to be done securely now and if

00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,990
you've missed that out you'll spend many

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:21,490
hours going why is this not working much

00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:24,639
your spare receiving data from Twitter

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,290
Python Twitter tools which is moving

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,420
Python the library I used to do this

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,759
lets you just basically plug into the

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,470
Twitter API which is pretty cool for now

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,879
at least until they make it so that you

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,490
can only access it half a dozen times

00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,439
and every second full moon I don't think

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:42,670
that's the case yet but some people have

00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:45,970
been worried so here we have receiving

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,500
data from Twitter so the easiest way to

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,660
do it so that you don't keep receiving

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,629
the same data is to keep track of the

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,519
last ID you've responded to my code it's

00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,079
automatically set to one which will lead

00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,079
to some problems on a second run of the

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,300
program but it means that as long as I

00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:03,459
keep updating which the last idea of

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,900
responded to us I can respond to new

00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:09,069
tweets without flooding my account and

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,260
sending data to sweater works pretty

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,650
much how you'd expect you feed it in

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,970
some kind of response and it gives it to

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,030
you so how have I evaluated messages

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,839
that have been sent to this chat bot

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,929
well first line here is

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,880
pretty much what you've already seen

00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:32,650
it's a word tokenization of the message

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,570
which is the twist and then I've done am

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,679
part of speech tagging exercise on it

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,150
touch that second line one one thing

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,830
that I ended up doing because it was

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,529
just too much of a pain to do otherwise

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,529
is using this simplified tag thing which

00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:49,730
cuts down the amount of tags fairly well

00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:53,620
so that you're not just sitting there

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:56,090
going what are all these tags even cuz i

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,610
I'm not that good with Grandma that I

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:02,720
know where every single little thing

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,610
goes in a sentence and it can tag in

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,380
quite great detail but the simplified

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,669
tags are pretty goods and from looking

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,830
at the bottle I've gotten some pretty

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:14,659
good results out of it so here's the

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,669
sort of things that it does and from

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,750
this if it is actually running you'll be

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:19,990
able to figure out how to make it do

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,970
horrible things that don't make sense

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:28,309
this is just a small example of some

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:31,220
terrible things that says so yeah I load

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,230
up that document and then somewhere my

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,870
code i have this mapping thing which

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,909
lets me map each of the things that's in

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,940
that document either objectives verbs or

00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,500
nouns to the relevant tags that the

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,880
natural language toolkit will provide

00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:50,450
the one interesting thing is that i put

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,370
the pro into now which is usually where

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,230
things like the name of the person

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,090
tweeting or the name of the account goes

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,460
so every cell from the chat bot will

00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:04,309
acknowledge somebody in a really creepy

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:07,010
way and strangely enough that's all the

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,750
slides i have which hasn't taken as long

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,260
as I thought but thank you for paying

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,260
attention

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,170
okay we've got about 10 minutes for

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:28,570
questions and if you can wait for the

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:30,280
mic that'd be good and what if you could

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,330
possibly go back and go something you

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,210
sort of slightly glossed over with

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,100
sentiment analysis that's it was an area

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,840
that's obviously is very useful one for

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,460
the targeted advertisements and opinion

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,260
mining and that sort of thing but it's

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,790
also something that's very very hard you

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,920
know you get a sentence like sarcasm is

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:49,000
awesome yeah is that a positive or a

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,190
negative statement yeah well you know so

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,650
I was wondering what what does NLT k

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,840
have and is it does it work is it any

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,040
good what's the where's the state of the

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,740
art had at the Bible with that yeah well

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,450
yeah this is why i put the failure in my

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,450
subtitle because you get a whole lot of

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,880
libraries and great big bits of text and

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,140
stuff but really you do need to learn

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,570
how to write your own documents that

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,970
will cover what you need to cover i was

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,340
doing a little bit of work on sentiment

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,110
analysis with hashtags some while ago

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,150
and i ended up compiling my own stock

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,040
words list for that purpose which worked

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,440
vastly better i think i was using

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,179
natural language toolkit for that but it

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,070
could have been used as stop words list

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,840
in there and it would have been far

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:41,110
superior to any viet ones that i was

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,970
using so it it gives you kind of the

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,190
framework so that you know your code

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,950
will make more sense to you months later

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,050
and you know where to plug your text in

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,450
but you do really need to know what

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,010
you're doing I think and sarcasm

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,300
detection i think is awesome it's

00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:59,410
something I really wanted to do my

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:01,890
thesis on this I thought even I'm not up

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,890
to that task

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:10,960
um I guess my question is sort of

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,510
similar um can you put a whole bunch of

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,390
data into natural language toolkit um

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,210
and ask it to do basic mapping between

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,620
words like like you said fly flying flew

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,410
etc and get it to just spit out

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,960
statistics or do you have to manually

00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,510
 all that in yourself and then get

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,200
it to do that and it does have some

00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:34,690
statistics type things on it I think in

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,880
word net which I didn't cover too much

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,770
you can there some tools to let you

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,720
check the similarity between words

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,059
depending on what wordnet things however

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,920
I played around with this and looked at

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,179
some examples in the insert and I kind

00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,880
of thought the numbers it was giving

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,200
were rubbish this it does there are

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,190
options where you can get a percentage

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,050
of similarity between things and some of

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,940
the default tools that you get do need

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,790
to be trained and when you train them

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,370
they can be a bit better this yeah you

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:17,170
have to exercise your own brain power as

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:20,830
well oh okay how good is this for

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,990
synthesizing languages that have that

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,880
have grammar like German we have

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,230
nominative and accusative and dated and

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,179
genitive and stuff like that I can't say

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,690
that I played very much it with

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,429
languages other than English so yeah I

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,040
don't know how competently I could

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:41,260
answer that it does some pretty

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,940
impressive stuff with not very much I

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,950
imagine if you had the right training

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,790
data you could get some of these tools

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,790
to perform quite well

00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:07,600
so any more questions hey thanks to the

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,970
top that's really cool to see people

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,200
doing fun stuff with NLT k I'm really

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,120
quickly with some of the other questions

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,830
I think you can find online people doing

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,300
research and putting blog post on

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,820
sentiment analysis and stuff like that

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,980
um with your chat bot I actually had a

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,770
really simple question has anyone hooked

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:29,290
up another chat bot to interact with it

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:31,270
no it's coming now excellent I hope

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,550
something comes during this conference

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,170
yeah there's a real shortage of people

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,790
doing this kind of chat bot stuff on

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,980
Twitter and services like that I know

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,990
there was a project a guy did with his

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,550
class where he got them to do chat BOTS

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,620
and try to get them to interact with

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,150
real people but there's not as much of

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,360
this out there as I thought there would

00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:51,070
be yeah I mean I think you know I talk

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,530
like this blog post stuff like that

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,820
we're showing people how to actually set

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,960
it up I think that's a really great

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,960
start makes it easy

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:10,030
someone else with with the token token I

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,920
Zurs but I think I mean there was like

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,390
this whole sentence tokenizer I was just

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,190
wondering is it smart enough to know

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,870
about the different uses of full stop so

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,640
that some end a sentence and some just

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:23,410
indicate a contraction yeah I don't know

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:28,150
if I've come across an example of that

00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:30,280
yes I it may well be a lot of the

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,050
tokenizer you can train and they would

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,860
probably then be able to recognize that

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,860
kind of stuff

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,869
excellent really enlightening I'm just

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:51,289
talking about the identification of

00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:53,419
people's background or their gender and

00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:55,639
so on you have to build your own

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,769
database in order to work that out or is

00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,080
there open data sets you could compare

00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:02,269
against instead especially in 65 years

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,820
old because they talked about looking

00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:06,350
back kotter or something I don't know if

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,570
those data sets are out there it's

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,070
entirely possible that somebody has them

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,989
I don't know if you'd be able to access

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,730
them freely but there are a lot of

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:15,350
pretty cool data sets out there most

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,909
most of the ones that i've looked at

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,450
natural language talk you know just

00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:22,580
standing part-of-speech tagging but it

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,519
probably wouldn't be too hard to get a

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,799
few people to provide some data and get

00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,210
something going there a lot of the tools

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,499
that I remember playing with you you

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,970
would interact with them they tell you

00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:33,950
what they think and you'd say well

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,450
gather your rice or you're wrong and

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,220
then they would learn from that so this

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,009
is probably the way that most people get

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,220
this data for themselves could you start

00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:44,570
with a group where you know the

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,669
characteristics of them like a specific

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,149
Internet message board and then mine it

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:51,799
for like a baseline he probably could

00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:55,330
but that would be an interesting way of

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,330
doing it Thanks

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:04,570
okay I if there's no more questions

00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,250
we'll just leave it there I'm

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,539
considering there's light lunch going on

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,840
you can hear all the people eating and

00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:13,090
you probably hungry yourself so oh I was

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,399
working yet I'd like to thank a lease

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:19,929
for speaking today and that was a very

00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:22,750
good talk and I've got I've got some

00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,340
african swallow coffee beans which is

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,370
very which is actually quite a nice

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:35,049
fruity blend and obvious i got a pipe in

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:36,100
my so yeah so let's sit there how good i

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,240
don't have to ask for a round of

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,100
applause you already gave one okay

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,100
