A big part of the Internet of Things are the end nodes, such as sensors, that    
are controlled by microcontrollers or other small computing devices. These    
devices are getting more and more sophisticated and it can be beneficial to    
program them with a scripting language instead of a low-level language like C.    
Such scripting languages need to be implemented specifically to fit and run on    
a microcontroller and in this talk I will discuss a few of them: Python, Lua,    
JavaScript and Ruby. I will talk in detail about MicroPython, a lean and    
efficient reimplementation of Python 3 with a reduced standard library, that    
runs on microcontrollers and can be used to build Internet-of-Things devices.    
There will be plenty of time in the talk for questions and open discussion.
