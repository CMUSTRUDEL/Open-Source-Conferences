What if you could provide access to sensor data in exchange for small amounts of payment, or give your devices a stipend and they could autonomously engage in commerce with in a marketplace of machines?

Payment solutions for microresources thus far have either required cumbersome aggregation, billing and centeralised metering or have been deemed too cheap to meter. We'll explore technology that could reduce this friction such as the bitcoin blockchain and open source python libraries that allow your devices to engage in micropayments in a fast, trustless and cheap manner.

hey I'm Mitch on the self-weight

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,870
developer at puzzle and so we control

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,960
batteries you might have heard from my

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,509
colleague dr. Kalman if you slide a few

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,070
our talks ago and so we um yeah we make

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,270
battery control systems when we tell the

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,820
battery went to the kind of charge and

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,699
discharge and today I'm going to be

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,369
talking about kind of payment layers and

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,650
especially focused on the IOT landscape

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,529
and so the title of the talk forward to

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,910
payment required in this status codes

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,469
for HTTP you can get you know a 200 ok

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,360
500 internal server error 404 not found

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,540
and when I was first looking at these

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,870
codes one well to kind of stood out that

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,180
I'm a teapot on the hypertext coffeepot

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,680
protocol but also the forward to payment

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,090
required and when I first saw this I was

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,920
really excited and I'm like I'm gonna

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,750
get heaps of four or tues and I'm going

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,219
to be paying for things and we can pay

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,629
just like we transfer data and so there

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,129
hasn't been a lot of that I guess and

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,460
this has been this thing that people

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,100
have been trying to implement for a

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,990
while but how can you transfer data but

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,049
then transfer value as well in a single

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,150
kind of transaction and so another way

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,619
you kind of think of this rather than

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,119
forward to and buzzwords and stuff is

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,119
like an open protocol for payment over

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,850
IP will be pretty great so just like

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,650
with HTTP we have this open protocol

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,470
it's it's fast it's easy to implement

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,820
like you don't have to download HTTP X

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,759
you like you can implement again this

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,439
against this protocol and when you speak

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,020
the right way things will listen to you

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,670
and so if you're a small IOT device you

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,259
can have your own implementation you can

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,880
spin up and you can just start chatting

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,619
and if you say the right things to the

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,810
right places then people will just talk

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,310
back you don't need to sign into things

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,470
you don't need to really identify

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,520
yourself you can just start transacting

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,770
in this data layer so to kind of make a

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,090
payment protocol like that you want a

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,920
lot of the similar things you want this

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,360
this implementation that anyone can

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,939
implement against rather than a fixed

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,070
system you want to be able to support a

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,469
wide ranging amount of value so very big

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,149
amounts of money and ideally very very

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,920
very small amounts of money when you

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,989
start thinking about computation and

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,560
stuff generally we think of micro

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,989
payments

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,540
in in kind of like the human senses like

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,010
one cent or two cents but ideally if you

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,290
could get it much much lower and start

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,270
paying on the bite or on the cpu cycle

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,160
at those kind of increments especially

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,580
in IOT space you start to get some kind

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,910
of interesting environments that can

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,430
develop from that and of course having a

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,810
party near trustless and anonymous is

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,760
nice because you can just start

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,410
transacting with people just like i can

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,030
send HTTP and get something back i don't

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,349
necessarily need to know exactly

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,000
everything about the person i'm

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,739
transacting with if i can also do that

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
on a value layer kind of like if i give

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,000
you cash we don't necessarily need to

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,860
trust each other in that kind of sense

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,549
and so that makes the transactions a lot

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,370
easier and so just for a simple example

00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:01,709
let's say you have a smart sprinkler and

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,970
it has a solar collector on it and so it

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,230
knows when to water your garden and when

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,510
there's clouds at won't water your

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,890
garden and it's not a device so of

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,290
course it's connected to the internet

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,480
and perhaps as a service like forecast

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,700
io sends it weather predictions and so

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,790
now in the morning it can decide whether

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,870
or not it's going to order the sprinkler

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,940
based on whether it's going to be cloudy

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,590
or not and this is a lot of the time

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,570
we're kind of diode a space at the

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,060
moment stops you have this device that

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,200
does this one very specific thing and

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,290
the rest of the time it kind of sits

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,940
idle so the sprinkler it has a lot of

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,940
other things going for it you know it's

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,470
this sensor out in the world and so you

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,959
might want to kind of aggregate that

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,640
data and so there's many sprinklers all

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,079
around the world someone might aggregate

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,310
the data now they don't need to put

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,829
sensors out there they can get it from

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,100
the sprinklers and perhaps they resell

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,150
it on to someone else like bomb and it

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,920
doesn't exactly look like this I know

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,470
but and then bomb perhaps could use that

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,870
data to fit into their weather data that

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,569
forecast our buyers and you can see in

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,470
this system that there's kind of this

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,209
transformation and then sending in

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,639
transformation and sending and each

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,620
player in this system is specialized for

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,030
their kind of service so the sprinkler

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,850
does something that the other services

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,319
can't do and that's measure the the

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,760
radiance at that point the data

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,789
aggregators really good at aggregating

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,370
bombs really good at what they do and if

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,440
so you can move around this way with the

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,050
data really easily through HTTP but if

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,430
you think about how you can move the

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,949
other way like how can we pay for these

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,820
this is and stuff like in a perfect

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:35,199
world you would just pay the spring for

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,789
a small amount of money you pay the

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,090
sprinkled pay forecast I owe a small

00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:41,320
amount of money but you kind of can't do

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,699
that you have to have these big service

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,039
agreements and logged in and put your

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,050
your payment credentials and stuff like

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,430
that and then further than that this

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,630
sprinkler still isn't being perfectly

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,190
utilized like there's a lot of other

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,470
things that can do so let's say you have

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,660
a big website and you want a load test

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,340
it's kind of hard to simulate a million

00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,750
devices or pinging you at the same time

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,789
this weird thing you have to simulate

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,050
but this sprinkler can do it and is

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,639
probably a lot of other sprinklers can

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,229
do in fridges and phones and anything

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,650
else and so you can also start doing

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,750
stuff like ping test really easy and

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,419
maybe the payment layer is kind of a

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,400
really small right so like a ping is

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,650
much less valuable than say the forecast

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,599
i/o service and so that's less value so

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,550
now your sprinkler has to say ping 10

00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,620
websites now can get a little bit of

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,710
data from forecast I oh and maybe it can

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,690
resell its solar data and so like in a

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,889
macro census totally makes sense like

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,630
this is just a market I'm not explaining

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,940
anything new but if we can implement

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,740
this on a day delay you can start doing

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,409
a lot of interesting things for instance

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,669
say for Castillo is under heavy Lloyd

00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,289
maybe they could have dynamic pricing

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,240
and so the prey rather than having to

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,349
rate limit everyone they've got the

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
scarce resource they're trying to

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,530
utilize maybe they could just up the

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,659
price lately the ones that need to

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,830
resource the moist will still get it and

00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,669
the ones that can wait a little bit will

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,259
wait and so this is kind of like an

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,330
excerpt from a really good piece you

00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,949
should read at the bottom but it's

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,840
basically talking about how like hey

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,280
she'd be is great but because you can't

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,520
do that value layer coming back the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,580
other way it's just very chatty and so

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,070
things are just too cheap to meter and

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,659
so from this you get things like d dos

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,370
on one end where everything's too cheap

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:18,009
to meter and on the other end you get

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,110
like these very complicated payment

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,780
systems and if we want these simple

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,400
devices then you know having to give you

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,570
credit card information or let's say

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,550
give you credit card information to

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,199
forecast area they give you a pik you

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,789
give the API keys to your sprinkler

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,970
maybe you've got to keep that credit

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,430
card updated that's kind of a

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,099
complicated system and so like kind of

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,930
modeling it like at the moment if four

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,320
castes pricing model is if you make less

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,910
than

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,310
a thousand calls a day you don't pay

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,960
anything and it's not they don't do that

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,250
because they're like charitable or

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,350
anything like that it's just because

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,450
they're like we're charging so little

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,820
perk all like one one-hundredth to the

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,950
sin that we just don't want to me to

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,810
that well we do want to me to that sorry

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,720
but we can't meet at that because it's

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,920
just too much to kind of work out but

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,660
then if you want to do a lot of calls

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,220
you have to give your credentials and

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,740
they'll give you back the data but also

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,500
there's so much on top of that with API

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,610
keys and sign up and payment processing

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,710
and even on there and they have to

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,900
settle properly and have to pay busy you

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,200
know 37 plus three percent or whatever

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,210
deal they have so ideally if you could

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,490
just break it down into this so you

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,870
would give payment in a trust 'less way

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:30,820
and they would say here's the data back

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:35,010
and then like you're done and so looking

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,540
at the thing an implementation like this

00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,970
this code here actually gets reasonably

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,130
close to that with there's a data

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,920
request on one end with proof of payment

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,020
and the data comes back on the other so

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,900
this kind of on the client side looks

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,290
like a pretty standard requests don't

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,140
get against the URL the URL just the

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,700
root of a server and the server is kind

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,440
of just a standard plus server right and

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,620
it just returns hallowed bike on a you

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,880
and so that's the data layer side the

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,290
value you side is just essentially this

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,730
this is a helper library that can kind

00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,650
of you can wrap things and so what's

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,710
happening on the client side is the

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,200
requests channel is getting wrapped to

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,210
handle 402 and on the right side the

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,030
kind of server is wrapping flask and

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,490
flask is now able to handle four or tues

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,380
and requests for payments and stuff so

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,770
just to quickly break down what's

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,600
actually going to happen you're just

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,000
going to make your standard requests for

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,200
/ like you normally do instead of just

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,330
getting a 200 back you're going to get a

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,070
402 and it's going to tell you where to

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:43,390
pay it then you pay it basically and you

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,530
can prove payment I can get the how you

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,380
can prove payment and it gives you a

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,060
receive for the payment and the third

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,830
step is now you make the same request

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,510
you made at the top with the receipt and

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,130
it gives you the response and so that

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,209
kind of three step process looks a

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,279
little bit complicated

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,689
but the good thing is that the library

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,339
kind of abstracts that all the way and

00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:03,970
you can kind of just do this and it will

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,999
start negotiating for you to use some

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,199
buzz words this is using the blockchain

00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:10,839
this is using layers on top of the block

00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,249
chain of Bitcoin but there's many ways

00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,720
you can implement and the reason why a

00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:16,029
lot of these implementations are being

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,800
on bitcoin is because it's a big network

00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,730
it setup it's somewhat mature for what

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,350
it does and so a lot of these things are

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,910
useful to do on that so that library

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,399
that I showed you that did the patching

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,639
of requests and flask is called the 21

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,019
library you can download it in a bunch

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,199
of different ways you can just pipe it

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:37,809
to show you can pip install it it's very

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:41,619
well documented to go look at github it

00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:43,480
comes with a bunch of modules on it that

00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,829
are all kind of separate so they have

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,420
that bitcoin module and that's their own

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,309
handwritten implementation against the

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,389
protocol so it's not like they import

00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:52,089
Bitcoin and things like that like

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,649
bitcoin is this protocol that you can

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,209
implement with however you want and so

00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,379
you can see their implementation you can

00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,709
see how they are announced things to the

00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:03,160
blockchain the kind of bit serve and bit

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:05,350
requests are the wrappers for flask and

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,339
Django this there's Jenga support as

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,540
well and there's requests so two one is

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,740
from 21-0 they are a commercial company

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,329
but they're kind of I think focusing

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,860
more on those hardware side and this is

00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,299
kind of a nice piece of open source

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,220
software they've come out through them a

00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:23,350
lot of these transactions you can do

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,579
from them they kind of make it a little

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,290
bit easier to do it from them but also

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,179
you can even just use their library to

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,160
not have anything to do with them and do

00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:33,519
transactions between people on block

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,899
chains or wherever you kind of want so

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,879
kind of one service you can do with this

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:40,179
as well is this ping test that I was

00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,029
leading to earlier like we we kind of

00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:46,179
want a lot of devices to ping a single

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:50,319
server and we can in this case actually

00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:52,059
so where the client and there's actually

00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:53,559
an aggregator so rather than having to

00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,019
ask for a million devices to being a

00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,519
server we can just say hey here's to one

00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,639
person like hey here's a payment for a

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,230
million pings can you please ping get a

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,879
million people to ping and so you just

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,590
pay one person they pay all the million

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,360
and everyone's happy and so

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,820
I really wanted to do a ping test on the

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,580
census site but it seems to not really

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,830
like it that much and actually I was

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,240
wondering about the legalities of

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,740
pinging like that and my friend said

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,290
well as long as you don't point a botnet

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,370
at it you'll be safe I know kind of like

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,750
well that was the point so yeah instead

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,740
of being that I'm just going to pin my

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,140
side FYI and so you can see I'm

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,100
making just one like once again the 21

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,360
command line thing adds even an extra

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,160
abstraction layer on that kind of simple

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,480
Python implementation where you can just

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,520
kind of do things from the command line

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,270
so this one's going to pull my website

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,770
and end in the data is um i'm gonna get

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,690
seven people to pin my website I mean

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,280
let's go and then they're going to come

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,870
back and tell me how they went what

00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:05,020
their response time was what they got I

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:07,690
hope this works no hmm alright so

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,140
apparently so I'm paying 3000 of these

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:16,930
little bits per call and so if I pinch 7

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,730
I know so yeah you can see here so I'm

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,030
paying three thousand little bits per

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,220
call and the seven so I want to pay 2100

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,440
and there's a default max price in this

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,030
call of 10,000 and that's kind of like a

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,360
safety method so I don't kind of pay too

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,680
much because the thing is you set a

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,330
limit on how much you want a page you

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,190
don't really know how much you're going

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:49,150
to pay until um so let's set Mac price

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:50,770
too what about 30,000 all right there

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,400
are the much safer method would have

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,510
been to just change n 23 or something

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,510
but we like to live dangerously

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:13,839
come on boom it worked it worked all

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,920
right so here's like bunch of so now it

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,709
comes back to the list and these are all

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,810
the different people to paint my server

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:23,890
look here someone oh it's from Buenos

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,120
Aires all around the place right and

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,380
then they kind of like they think it

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,390
three times that was quite nice and they

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,290
kind of are giving me a good many times

00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,700
ooh this is a that was a slow one and

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,990
stuff like that so so actually I just

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,790
implemented that thing I showed you of

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,160
you send data oh sorry you send a

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,630
payment and you get data back like there

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,640
it is like let's not use it in

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,250
production like this a bunch of caveats

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,080
and work to be done in stuff but like

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,050
there's these new things that are kind

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,110
of moving in the right direction so for

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,880
instance when I send this request to the

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,920
aggregator to do these pings I actually

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,899
had to send proof i won i had to pay and

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,209
to actually had to send proof that i had

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:02,860
paid through the Bitcoin block chain and

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:06,370
it was like this transaction and things

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,250
like that but if I couldn't prove that I

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,130
could pay like they won't let me do that

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,150
so even like simple implant

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,760
implementations like work to some extent

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:19,209
right now it's still kind of like a

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:22,180
hobbyist kind of thing but it works so

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,339
here here's another one right so there's

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,500
a service setup you can all go to it I

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,480
guess don't cry crush it in like 15

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,029
minutes and stories don't miss out FYI

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,410
and you can store stuff on there and you

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:33,730
can read stuff on there and can write

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,330
stuff on there and it's going to charge

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,800
you per bite the pricing isn't good so I

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:43,650
wouldn't actually recommend storing

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,650
stuff on that for per bite but so I

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,329
satoshi she's like a millionth of a

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:54,730
Bitcoin and so as Satoshi works out to

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:56,440
like whatever 1 103 of a dollar and so

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,450
it's basically charging you very very

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,640
small amounts per bite but that can

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:05,410
actually meet at that right and so if

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,700
you go to the github thing as well like

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,070
there's a full implementation you can

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,440
just run it and you can start kind of

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,920
doing micro transactions for storage

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,020
as like just a drug thing and so

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,970
basically the demo I've actually

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,680
screencapped what the demo was because

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,580
the demo works but it's a bit unstable

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,450
to some extent so if we kind of look in

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,680
the storage file now it's empty and if

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,850
we look at the client the client says

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,500
like tell us the URL of the storage file

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,140
on the server and then tell us where we

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,410
you want to mount that and so I say like

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,760
oh here's where the files are and I want

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,960
to mount it to this flash storage file

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,570
that I just saw so basically i'm going

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,650
to create a virtual folder and so this

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:52,330
folder now when I ping it at the top now

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,340
there wasn't stuff in there now there is

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,670
stuff in there file is in a day with the

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,320
files on the server and so basically

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,630
with this like the top part the user

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,070
part is what the user does now and the

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,630
bottom part is what's going on in the

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,820
background so once the client started

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,440
people can just like LS and cat and move

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,210
things around and just interact with it

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,250
like just a normal folder on a file

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,140
system but underneath what's happening

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,730
is through HTTP the client and the

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,800
server are basically one negotiating

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,920
payment and transferring payment and

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,610
then also transferring the files so an

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,380
LS is the opcode read directory and that

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,030
one's free actually so if you just code

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,980
against that it would send the files

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,180
back and kind of the top user layer is

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,670
the view layer where it shows you like

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,890
hey here's the files so you can read

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,280
directory you can read file attributes

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:42,280
kind of so you can do a stat on it and

00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,470
the stat is the get attribute of a file

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,940
so we're getting where we're standing on

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,950
hello world so it gets attribute of

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,070
hello world kit kind of gives you the

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,420
size and bites of the file and then you

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,900
know all of these dates are wrong

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,790
bajatey three bytes that's great but

00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,650
then when we try to read the file if we

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,440
just trying to a curl with an opcode of

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:04,660
read it returns back this scary-lookin

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,240
thing it returns back a payment required

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,520
like we'll take them back about before

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,180
and it also gives you like an address to

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,530
make the payment and so if I curl

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,760
against that I get a forward to and I

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,800
don't know what to do patching this

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,949
requests library means the decline on

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,679
the background it gets the 402 it does a

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,220
put with the payment and then it gets a

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,839
receipt from the payment 6

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,270
Phillipos repayment and I don't have the

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,530
last line here but the last line was the

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,240
third step we're now it's got the

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,919
receipt now it's going to do an actual

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,140
the same request it did before with the

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,659
with the read up code and it's going to

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,669
get back hello world and like the hello

00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:44,690
world spelt wrong and that's terrible

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:46,220
but it kind of its doing this so like

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,679
you can kind of see like you know one

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,840
two three four that's kind of like the

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,520
first of all here like request / forward

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,140
to I make a payment you give me the

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,240
receipt and then the last two which

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,620
aren't shown is I now remake the same

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,440
request i just made with the receipt and

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:04,880
i get the response and then a right file

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,890
kind of does the same thing i'm moving

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,299
the file into storage because you you

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,559
don't want to like live at it the

00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:12,620
storage files at the moment it's a

00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,450
disaster but kind of same thing like

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,830
forward to and make the payment and here

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,809
actually i see the third part where now

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,950
that i've made the payment i do the

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,169
thing i wanted to do in the first place

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:25,520
I wanted to put on hello world to update

00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:29,000
it with my receipt and then today I like

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,559
I've updated on the server and kind of

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,080
here are the three parts that matter

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,539
like the 40 to the payment and then the

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,270
rear request with the payment shown and

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,679
here's just a thing from the server

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,780
where I cat the file and now I can see

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,030
that the file is fixed from the server

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:52,100
and updated it from the client and so

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:54,590
yeah like this is this is not anywhere

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,150
close to there is like a cool like like

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,070
Internet of Things micro devices you

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,350
know I've sped data on my phone like

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,539
what IOT device wants to like negotiate

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,370
with me to pv back the signal right like

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,809
everyone's talking about connecting to

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,940
the internet and hard it is like I'll

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,830
just walk past and if you just pay me

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,220
like a tenth of a cent like I'll up i'll

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,690
upload a few kilobytes for you oh I've

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,280
got storage on my phone you know there's

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,039
all these unutilized devices out there

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,750
that would be happy to transact

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,789
basically but it's just at the moment

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,020
the friction it's just a disaster like

00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:25,760
how would you even do that right now

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,230
you'd have to like get an app and you're

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,240
put in your credit card and you'd like

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,549
to sign up and other IOT devices would

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,679
sign up and then like you report back to

00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:35,750
a server and you say like hey this I did

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,049
this for this guy like pay me money and

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,519
that's all fine but just like hey Steve

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:44,149
see if we could have these open

00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,220
protocols for payment as well then it

00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,779
kind of potentially could just alleviate

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,179
all that where people can just start

00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:53,960
transacting and sending data and

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:59,110
utilizing themselves there's a lot of

00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:02,059
things that need to be done though so a

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,710
foolish you need cheap transaction fees

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:06,830
right like if I'm transacting like a

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,989
millionth of a cent i can't i can't pay

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,489
a dollar and even things like bitcoin

00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,470
which somewhat get the transaction price

00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:13,850
down is still like eight cents and so

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,950
there's still way too much I orders of

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,049
magnitude too much there's a lot of very

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:22,009
interesting things in this area to lower

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:23,539
transaction fees quite dramatically but

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:27,559
that's a really big area that needs to

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:30,200
be worked on the the other big thing as

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,820
well is ok now we can prove payment but

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,070
how do I prove that you gave me

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,710
something useful back so in the example

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,889
where my phone say PV like uses its 3G

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,899
connection for your data like okay so

00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:43,609
your IOT device like pays me for the

00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:45,499
request and then maybe I can just say oh

00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,850
I just got an empty response back that

00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:48,830
that's what the server told me and

00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,109
there's really no way of them validating

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,119
was I was was actually doing it or not

00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:56,480
like my site the storage site with reads

00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,859
and writes and stuff like I know like

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,690
maybe I'll give you back the file that

00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,100
you wanted to read but maybe I'll just

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,509
say anything and there's no really a lot

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,190
you can do about it there's not the

00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:05,600
point that it's anonymous and Trust

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,850
looks like you can't complain to someone

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,129
and get a refund you can't enforce a lot

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,369
of things like that even like how do you

00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:15,619
revert a transaction if the server

00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:16,970
crashes because like you saw before it

00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,070
was this step process where you make a

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,840
payment and then you show the receipt

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,129
when you do the request like what

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,509
happens if the cert you make the payment

00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:27,139
and then the server just crushes like

00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:29,419
right now there's really no way to to

00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:32,509
recover that money and so I think on the

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,429
data side like being able to if you

00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:36,950
could be able to validate that this data

00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,210
is actually of value and there's a lot

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,739
of different ways you could potentially

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,090
do that I think that that will really

00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:45,590
kind of close the loop and then you can

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,230
start transacting are endlessly in both

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,029
ways so so I can pay you to store

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,499
something and if I could guarantee that

00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:52,400
you would store that and if you lost it

00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,140
say I'll get a pen

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,780
you'll be penalized if you couldn't

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,950
prove that you continue to store it I

00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:02,510
think that that kind of system kind of

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,280
yeah really closes the loop and really

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,200
makes it solid and there's actually a

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,990
lot of work being done on those areas of

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:14,380
how can you prove certain things for

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:16,640
example like in the storage area perhaps

00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,930
because the thing is like how do you

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,400
prove something without disproving the

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,770
whole thing so if I want you to do a

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,210
computation how do I know that you

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,070
actually did the computation without

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,710
actually doing the computation myself

00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,630
and so through things like hashes and

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,610
kind of turning problems into those

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,520
problems where it's easier to verify

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,620
even be the either verify that the whole

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,600
output of the transaction or be able to

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,460
verify certain parts of the transaction

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,370
so if i could just inspect like ten

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,690
percent of the calculation and if that

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,190
worked out to be correct then i could

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,600
probably and where i can probably

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,100
guarantee the rest was correct and I'd

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,500
randomly inspector part of the

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,560
calculation those kind of things on the

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,240
data coming back as well is like a vital

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,610
way it doesn't work if you basically if

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,570
you can't do that doesn't work because

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,580
people like you have to assume bad

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,550
actors in these situations and you know

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,720
the best response is basically a zero

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,790
response kind of thing if you're going

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,570
to get paid either way and so in forcing

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:14,390
it on that side as well is useful so

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,640
here's some links there's the big point

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:20,060
pro I've linked to protocols not to the

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,290
websites and I think it's at least from

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,170
this perspective it's important because

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,790
that I think that's the thing that kind

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,110
of matters like the Bitcoin protocol

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,430
like whatever the first four bytes of

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,130
the version and the next is the input

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,740
and things like that and so I think

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:36,020
making it this clear thing that you know

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,180
Bitcoin or or whatever these these

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,650
things are people implement on it's not

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,050
a thing it's not you don't download

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,340
Bitcoin or you don't need Bitcoin dohc

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,080
or anything like that that there are

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,070
common implementations that people use

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,480
but actually anyone anyone with like a

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,370
connection that can make HTTP requests

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,590
or TCP requests can write their own

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,790
Bitcoin stack and just like HTTP they

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,860
can start speaking in the right way and

00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,650
the network will listen I think that in

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,210
all of this if anything like if you can

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,830
get it that way that's that's that's

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,970
really useful because a lot of people

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,990
can implement in a lot of different ways

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,910
and make it

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:12,980
for them and also build on top of that

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,540
so you might say that you know I don't

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,429
want it open I don't I want to actually

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,950
not make it trustless I want people to

00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,870
be authorized just like HTTP you can

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,970
build this walled garden on top of HTTP

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,400
like when I'm using the app store it

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,260
doesn't mean that i think that like this

00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,210
this thing up HTTP is useless i'm still

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,690
be using it but i can just put my own

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:35,360
layer on top of that and do the things i

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:46,420
want to do with it so that's my talk and

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:46,420
that's it questions

00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:59,779
hi great tool and just wondering about

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:03,320
the whole concept really of micro

00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:05,960
payments and you know freedom of access

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,509
in the internet isn't really Austin you

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:14,469
want a not micropayments you want you

00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:19,070
want to allow data to be free well

00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:20,059
that's true and once again if people

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,039
want to have it i'm not saying that

00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,769
every endpoint has to have the have a

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,450
micro payment on it and if people want

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,679
to have free and free endpoints

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,809
literally free in terms of free money

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,299
and points that's fine but if you do

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:33,559
want to start putting things on it a lot

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,269
of it kind of reminds me of the talk

00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,299
that Nick gave a few talks ago about the

00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,219
Internet of not great things with with

00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,739
how like if you're not if you're not the

00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:46,879
the customer than you're the product and

00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:48,320
this idea that with Google let's say yes

00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,089
they do sell your services on you get

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,759
this thing for free but actually even if

00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:54,409
you wanted to pay very small amounts you

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,029
couldn't there's like not infrastructure

00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:58,460
setup like that and so with these

00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:01,159
methods that there is already economic

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,019
value being transferred within them by

00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,210
having a protocol like this you can now

00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,129
kind of expose that layer now becomes

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,200
actually open like so you pay for a

00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:11,089
resource what that resource is actually

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,499
worth you don't get the resource for

00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:14,839
free and some dodgy dealing goes on in

00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:18,049
the background and so yeah it's not this

00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,669
thing of that everything is now locked

00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,289
down and you need to be able to pay for

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,960
everything it would be for those

00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:26,450
services that generally already been

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:34,759
paid for in some way being able to kind

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:37,269
of openly openly transact on them any

00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,269
other questions

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:46,080
in order to get the cost of transaction

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,820
down what kind of stuff like where does

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,590
that money go at the moment someone

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,040
doesn't know their transaction costs

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,630
yeah like where's that 8 cents yep so in

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,260
Bitcoin weathers a transaction cost

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,250
essentially there's a network of people

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,520
mining that would bid their kind of

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,990
working very hard not they're not

00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,580
actually working out hard to process

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,260
transactions but they're doing this

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,830
other thing that basically protects the

00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:13,230
network from attacks and so you have to

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,940
basically incentivize one of those

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,530
people on the network to basically pick

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,510
up your transaction and include it in

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,660
the thing that they're doing and so at

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,309
the moment yeah it's an eight cents

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,190
there's a bunch of different like like

00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,390
for instance one thing I'd really if it

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,429
at all interest you is to look at the

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,960
lightning paper network because

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:34,320
essentially what it does is it creates

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,360
these smaller chat like let's say Thomas

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,190
over here and we're going to transact a

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,809
lot with each other like in the in the

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,370
device with the sprinkler and forecast I

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,530
oh that sprinkler knows it's going to

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,049
transact like 10,000 times with

00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,820
forecasts over its lifetime and so if

00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,740
you could say rather than making ten

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,330
thousand transactions to the network if

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,230
you could somehow aggregate that into

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,640
one transaction but still keep a trust

00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,190
less between both the parties kind of

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,809
like a bar tab in a trust less manner

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,280
then you only need to one transaction to

00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,690
the network and now you've just reduced

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,520
the transaction costs by ten thousand

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,840
fold without actually having to reduce

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,030
the transaction costs so there's a lot

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,299
of different ways at it I think that

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:15,540
yeah like getting that transaction costs

00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:18,380
like down to almost zero is like will be

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,380
good if it can be done

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,240
would you see a case where you might

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,980
sort of top up your sprinkle with credit

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
so it's allowed to it may not have

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,360
anything to offer but it may need to

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,890
access services that yeah I think it's a

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,809
perfect example like that the way I like

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,610
to think of it is these Ned zero things

00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,289
where the devices can provide service to

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:45,330
the other things and even if they do

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,190
have something that's a very very low

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,539
service like i said in the ping service

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,490
that it was ten times less maybe it's a

00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,870
million times less and so the sprinklers

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,299
to do a million pings to get a single

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,100
request its point of doing much so maybe

00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,590
wants to do that but yeah to your case

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,710
yeah maybe you just put two cents on it

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,090
and it's fine for life and even right

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,799
now with a current implementation

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,779
there'd be a really easy way of doing

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,100
that without having to directly track

00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:11,340
like you wouldn't have to connect to the

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,899
device to do that but yeah you can put

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:20,460
two cents on it as well and you could

00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:22,649
you got to go forever I've got a

00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,179
question for you do you want to make any

00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:28,140
comments on sort of what's been going on

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,610
on some of the the currencies and

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,559
whether you think that you know the

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,029
current currencies are the ones likely

00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,320
to work in this kind of system or

00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:39,500
whether you think new currencies are

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,669
likely to emerge cool so just quickly

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,649
one of the second-biggest currency a

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:45,809
theory and had a thing called the doubt

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,940
and a theorem does these things with

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,110
smart contracts where and bitcoins look

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,149
slightly does it as well where you're

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,399
not actually doing just data transfers

00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:55,470
you also complete logic in the code and

00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,779
so before when I was talking about how

00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,580
can you like you know only give the

00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,679
payment if I get a good response back

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,149
you can kind of implement that in a

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,750
theory and where you implement the logic

00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:08,700
beforehand and then you can kind of like

00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,669
the logic settles the arrangement and

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,350
and there was a problem like whatever

00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,659
like 70 million dollars went into this

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:18,570
contract that just a program controlled

00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,549
and there was a bug in the code and so

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,929
and the thing about these contracts is

00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:23,549
like their trust us net foolproof in

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:24,990
their immutable and once you write it

00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:26,640
it's like set in stone it's like law

00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,860
like that's the reason it was there and

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,149
so you know it does a bug in the code

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,740
and someone got away with all the money

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:35,760
and and things like that and so they did

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,760
an interesting thing with actually

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,030
forked there

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,130
leger their kind of blockchain their

00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,080
status so if you had one either one day

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,640
you actually had to either the next day

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,860
on two different chains and these two

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,210
different networks and now there's if

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,650
they're in classic and there's a theorem

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,360
they're both still running and they both

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,970
still have a price so there's a lot of

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,710
interesting things happening in this

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,960
field and a lot of lessons being learned

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,110
and this was a 70 million dollar less

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:07,310
than that was being learned but I'd say

00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:10,490
that this is probably one I think say

00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,590
the bigger protocols are to some extent

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,150
maturing I know I just explained a story

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,650
that doesn't sound like that but they're

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,360
learning lessons and and they're growing

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,400
and I think that this is they're moving

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,280
very quickly in trying things like this

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,080
idea of this contractor own 70 million

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,190
dollars I think that's one way to go

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,930
about it I think you'll get good results

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,160
I think it won't look right at the start

00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:32,240
there's going to be many many more

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,740
mistakes made but yeah I think that

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,960
there's good progress being made and

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,000
that you know with payment layers even

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,010
potentially more than he'd like just

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,780
data requests you don't want these bugs

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,260
later on you want to iron them out now

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:48,290
and so you know when these big mistakes

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,830
happen to some extent it's quite nice

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:55,100
they're happening now when it's still

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:57,020
it's 70 million dollars but like it's

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,610
not it's not it's not do or die yet and

00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,900
so there is some time to kind of make

00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,300
these mistakes and learn these lessons

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,890
the hard way and like you know I'm sure

00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,630
there's going to be much less bug

00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,250
everyone's like taking a step back now

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,720
and they are we were way too like free

00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,800
and easy with these contracts and now

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,240
these contracts are going to get way

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,340
better and not have these bugs so I'm

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,620
I'm cautiously optimistic and it will be

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,790
a very interesting ride with all the

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,200
things they're trying to implement but I

00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,430
think progress is good and if you want

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,390
to do it faster make mistakes that's

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,520
fine and if you want to be cautious

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:32,320
that's fine too and the best method to

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,320
win out right oh one more question

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,799
thank you not so much a direct question

00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,580
is more of like what do you think of

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,990
where this may lead where we have

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,690
microtransactions where devices are

00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,490
incentivized to provide data so they

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,620
have a sensor and I can provide that to

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:56,850
the network because the weather station

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,350
wants to know if it's raining what's

00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,850
going to happen when we have all of

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,320
these devices packed with lots and lots

00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:05,100
of different sensors that they want to

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,760
sell to the network for whatever company

00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,020
would may wish to purchase it is this

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,630
going to cause some interesting supply

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,950
demand kind of thing is do you have any

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,860
thoughts on this as have you read any

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,690
papers or where this may go I haven't

00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:24,000
read any papers I just kind of make

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:26,250
things up but if you like the things

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,950
that have like we we priced goods for a

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,840
reason in the market it does and we can

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,790
say things about like capitalism and it

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,520
doesn't you know distribute resources

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,559
that fairly but it does a better job

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,500
than perhaps some other ways of

00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,850
distributing resources and so to say

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,140
that like you start going down and down

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,280
in the price of goods and then you get

00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,570
to this threshold where you go Oh

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,370
actually doesn't matter anymore like all

00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,110
these things we had for markets that

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,549
mattered when that thing was one dollar

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:54,120
now it doesn't matter anymore because

00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:56,010
it's like one hundred percent it doesn't

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,809
the magnitude doesn't matter as much but

00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,600
those effects still hold and so yeah I

00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:01,890
think that with supply and demand if

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,390
there's too many sensors in a region

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,850
then the market is going to deem the

00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,799
price per sensing low and so potentially

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,929
like say the sensors in the region the

00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,429
one to give the best sensing data will

00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,859
probably be the ones that are preferred

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,990
or with the forecast area like if they

00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,399
are getting d dust rather than just

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,810
having a flat rate limiting and just

00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,129
saying to everyone like no no no you're

00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,710
all requesting too much like everyone

00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,659
stop just with the dynamic price and so

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,690
you know I work for a pleasant we do

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,389
battery control and just seeing it

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,330
respond to price signals in the market

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:35,070
you know we we look at the energy price

00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,990
and energy as a dynamic price and

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,909
looking at it respond to those price

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:43,169
signals in the market if you model the

00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,440
situation well and just give it an

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,659
optimization function

00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,700
in some circumstances like devices can

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,290
do amazing things and so even a

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,260
sprinkler you might say like who cares

00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:56,619
about it responding to a price signal

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,260
well one if there's a billion sprinklers

00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:01,150
everyone cares but to implement it to

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,700
respond you could just say a simple

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,170
thing like you know I need you to get a

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,290
reading from forecast area between say

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,790
five a.m. and 8am and that'll be my

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,099
morning prediction and between like 9

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,290
p.m. and midnight and try and minimize

00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,300
costs and just assume the cost for today

00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,579
the dynamic cost of forecast I will be

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,930
the cost from yesterday and even as

00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:21,069
simple and they can't all do that

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,869
because then you get oscillations and

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:24,579
will be terrible but even a simple

00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,500
implementation like that right which is

00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:29,920
very easy to write it's very low

00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,930
computationally if you haven't liked it

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,060
a not insignificant amount of devices in

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,160
a market doing that then you start to

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,170
get some quiet nice demand response to

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,510
the price signaling and now forecast I

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:42,099
oh never need to shut off servers they

00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,540
never need to rate limit anyone they can

00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,810
just adjust their price based on who

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:50,230
wants it and the network of devices can

00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,020
adjust like globally in this way that it

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:58,390
almost looks like they're cooperating

00:35:52,020 --> 00:36:02,099
just like a normal market great please

00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,099
