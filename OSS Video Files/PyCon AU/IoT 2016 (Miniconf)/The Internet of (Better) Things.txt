The Internet of Things! Existential menace or meaningless buzzword?
Automating away drudgery or just eroding privacy? Cornucopia or Panopticon?

We'll look at the poor state of the current IoT in terms of 
security, privacy and interoperation.  We'll consider a set of 
requirements for a better IoT.  And we'll look at what
we as Pythonistas can do to improve on this, as a community
and an industry.
