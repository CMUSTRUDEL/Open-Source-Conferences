Title: The Internet of (Better) Things
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: IoT 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Nick Moore
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/137/view_talk
The Internet of Things! Existential menace or meaningless buzzword?
Automating away drudgery or just eroding privacy? Cornucopia or Panopticon?

We'll look at the poor state of the current IoT in terms of 
security, privacy and interoperation.  We'll consider a set of 
requirements for a better IoT.  And we'll look at what
we as Pythonistas can do to improve on this, as a community
and an industry.

good afternoon everyone for those of you

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:10,230
who needed a second dose of Nick here he

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,519
is by popular acclaim back for a second

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,410
talk today and he's going to be talking

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:22,020
about the the Internet of better things

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:24,779
so please welcome Nick thanks everyone

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,439
thanks for coming on the previous talk

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,740
was all about esp8266 and micro Python

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,219
and some very very concrete sensible

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,550
things this talk is a little bit more

00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,960
free ranging but I think we've come to a

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,640
really interesting point in it the

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,110
history of the Internet of Things a

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,289
really interesting kind of junction

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,450
point in where this strange little

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,590
industry is is going and so I think

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,510
there's some things that actually kind

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,489
of need to be discussed now I think in a

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,260
lot of ways we have to have a an adult

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,809
conversation at this point about what

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,230
Internet of Things is going to mean to

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,420
people it's often discussed as this

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,970
panacea this whole this will cure

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,830
everything oh you've lost something were

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,900
my get an intent of things thing that's

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,310
easy we'll just track it everywhere do

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,100
you want to know that your fitness will

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,259
track that will analyze that yeah we

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,909
will solve every conceivable problem

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,320
with the internet of things and if only

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,060
we could work out and make it work with

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,770
the blockchain then we can solve

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,049
everything twice you know it's it's

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,180
often presented that way it's often

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,579
always also presented as this pan

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
opticon prison where every single thing

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,420
you do will be monitored your vehicle

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,750
will be logged your pulse will be logged

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,549
it there will be no secrets left and

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,939
this is not entirely without reason the

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,180
NSA have stated they are looking at

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,100
internet of things things that exists

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,200
like fitness trackers as potential

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,850
information sources we know that they've

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,610
already been legal cases that have

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,590
hinged on recorded information from

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,740
people's what are those kings coll

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,649
Fitbit

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,270
tracking bands to to say if you said I

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,310
was at home sitting on the couch and

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,830
your band showed that you were running

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,540
around there's a case to make there so

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,160
there is actually a legitimate concern

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,989
for these things but like a lot of

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,280
things the way you see the technology is

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,349
not necessarily depending on the

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,269
technology a lot of people might say

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,849
that surveillance cameras were a good

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,620
thing preventing crime and at filming

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,390
the police's to go about their duties is

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,580
a bad thing because it's really like

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,260
cramping their style a lot of other

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,840
people would say the exact opposite

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,760
about these technologies and after all

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,380
you this you end up coming up to the

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,010
conclusion it's not really about the

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,900
technology it's not about the camera

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,060
it's not a technical issue at all it's

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,060
about the control of the data that that

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,580
camera produces the police seem to be

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,769
extremely aunty the idea of citizens

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,900
filming them in going about of their

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,769
duties unless their cameras that they

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,230
have themselves that sometimes work and

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,870
sometimes don't this is a strange

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,609
property of the technology people in

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,170
general quite like having surveillance

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,390
cameras on their own property that they

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,590
control themselves but not so much if

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,260
you suggest that the government should

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,410
be doing that again it's not a technical

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,000
property of the the technology it's a

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,650
matter of the control of the data that

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,459
comes out of it this was actually

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:32,970
foreshadowed immensely by hang on I

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,380
added an extra slide this is a new

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,140
technology and so we're getting a new

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,850
kind of legal frameworks new etiquette

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,799
around this stuff just like mobile

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,440
phones back in the 90s when they were

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,700
regarded is a little bit weird there was

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,670
some etiquette about you know I'll just

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,530
step out to use my phone and maybe don't

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,480
like use it in public because people

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,459
will look at me funny i was living in

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,910
fitzroy at the time okay so maybe things

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,650
are a bit different elsewhere there's

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,660
lots of people breaking new ground with

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,930
fancy new technologies and things like

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,100
that and the market for what these

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,530
things are good for how they're going to

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,480
work etc isn't really settled down yet

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,519
so let's just let mobile phones where in

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,060
the 90s or like motor cars were back in

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,060
the 20

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:28,500
Amelia argument so this stuff gets

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,000
discussed a lot online funnily enough a

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,759
term of art at the moment is the

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,259
incident of because people have

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
noticed that this technology is not all

00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,680
great and you can tell it's a real term

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,800
of art because it has a twitter handle

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,080
and it has a reddit thing out and it's

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,180
also the guys same guys on medium and so

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,599
on and so forth there's a lot of

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,190
examples coming out of just how terrible

00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,569
some of these technologies are and I

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,180
think what's important is we have to

00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,819
learn from those technologies or from

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,620
those those problems on the one hand you

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,060
could look at and go that's just

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,710
terrible I'm going to throw it away and

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,759
walk away or you could look it and go

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,310
well here is a bunch of case studies

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,349
that people have done for me often

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,969
paying for this hardware and doing it

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:14,349
for me for free I could learn from that

00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:15,879
and do better next time so I think the

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,620
way forward for this stuff is to do some

00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,210
analysis of the ways it is currently bad

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,909
and there are plenty of those to choose

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,979
from and to use that to develop some

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:26,199
requirements for how we could be not bad

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,610
and to go from there only once you've

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:33,729
done those things to start talking about

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:35,590
the technologies so starting in on the

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,569
ways it is bad if you're not the custom

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,979
ii or you're the product this

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,130
observation has been made quite a few

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,960
times by people if it dates back a long

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,360
long way and various people of all miss

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,909
quoted each other on and off but comes

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,979
from way back if you're not the custom

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:53,259
you're not the product you the companies

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,759
that you use for these services have to

00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,379
make money somehow I think we can just

00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,969
take that as a given unless it's the

00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,719
government the NSA doesn't actually need

00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:07,590
your money so they will store your data

00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:09,580
for you for free nobody else will so

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,810
somehow they have to make money so

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,569
either they can do it by selling your

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,370
privacy out or they can do it by selling

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,259
your services on a monthly basis which

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,210
is a great business model and I would

00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:21,789
love to have people doing that to me

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,099
obviously but it's not necessarily the

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,930
best thing for the innocent of things or

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,479
they can charge you a fee and that fee

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,460
unfortunately may start cheap and get

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,789
more expensive and so on this is a very

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,789
common problem

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,020
the the part of the problem here is that

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,510
we've kind of ended up conflating IOT

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,070
and big data so we have this thing we've

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,500
got all these things on the internet

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,030
they all generate data and they use data

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,580
and so a whole bunch of people who have

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,380
big data platforms going yes you should

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,560
store them in a big data platform you go

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,540
it's my light switch why and they go no

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,020
reason we weren't analyzing it or

00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,330
anything much maybe a little I don't

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,820
know but it's led to this conflation

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,070
between IOT and big data that I OT means

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,500
everything has to be on the internet and

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,330
when I flipped my light switch amazon

00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,190
need to know or Google need to know or

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,900
someone like that needs to know to relay

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,070
that signal back to me I think that's a

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,630
little sad as a conflation another

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,010
reason is the end of life this photo

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,230
here is a picture of a thing called a

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,630
revolve and the author of the the

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,290
article linked at the bottom there

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,290
writes a little bit of a diatribe there

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,850
about how he's been sold a tub of hummus

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,290
because this beautiful little plastic

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,610
box here that used to talk to the

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,590
internet and all these home automation

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,480
devices and all of this has just been

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,220
end of life by Google who acquired the

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,780
company who made it and I no longer

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,370
interested in supporting it so they just

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,680
send out a oh yeah sorry doesn't work

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,820
anymore as of this date by the way that

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,380
means your thermostat doesn't work your

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,700
lights don't turn on anymore all of that

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,410
fancy stuff that you spent time

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,840
automating and making work really nicely

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,370
oh that's just gone sorry man I mean

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,680
it's not under warranty or anything

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,419
because that already expired so you know

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,310
I think that's really sad and you've got

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,900
all of this work you've put into

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,400
building these systems up and making

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,140
them work nicely together that just goes

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,330
down the drain whenever a vendor decides

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,300
to walk away and this happens remarkably

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,360
often the churn rate for startups in

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,040
this sort of space is very high and we

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,600
are in a start-up space and in addition

00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,050
people don't really like supporting

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,240
their old products very much there's

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,520
really very little cross brand support I

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,590
mean other than using something like if

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,010
this then that to bridge between two

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,340
foreign vendor systems and make them

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,360
sort of manually switch between them

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,620
generally if you buy this brand of light

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,940
bulb it works this way if you buy that

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,130
brand of light switch it works that way

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,370
you can't cross connect those things I

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,440
think that's what it said

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,180
it means that we're generating more

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,089
waste it means that we're wasting time

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,089
it means that we're wasting packets

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,279
another one is internet not found errors

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,800
the the example here is actually the the

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,720
cat feeder was a product as an automatic

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,900
cat feeder that you can program over the

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,060
Internet and unfortunately the company

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,540
who produces this their servers went

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,980
down for a little while and so it turns

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,960
out this cat feeder is incapable of

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,580
feeding your cat while the internet is

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:24,210
not there cats and the internet there's

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,890
some connection there obviously but a

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,650
lot of these devices have this same

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,930
vulnerability or the same floor no

00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,850
internet no work this seems a little

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,770
silly I mean my wife is still up it's

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,260
still connecting all my details devices

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,000
together why is my cat feeder not

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,160
capable of remembering what I told it to

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,390
feed the cat in case anyone's getting

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,130
distressed at this point by the way it

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,920
was only off for like 10 hours so no

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,630
cats were actually harmed although some

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,180
furniture might have been harmed in the

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,130
process even the most reliable networks

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,000
go down i work in enterprise-e kind of

00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:02,550
software and even big company networks

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,500
have problems routers die or providers

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,910
disconnect things and stuff like that in

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,640
practice if you want to run anything

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,830
that's critical for a production

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,260
facility you have backups you have

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,390
multiple internet links you have 4g

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,360
wireless cards in all of your things so

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,790
that they can cut over to 4G if the

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,620
local site Wi-Fi goes down and you use

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,800
those backups and you test those backups

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,420
otherwise they don't work you're not

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,010
going to do that for your fridge you're

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,080
not going to do that for your answering

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,490
machine or your doorbell or whatever

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,370
you're never going to test it even if

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,670
you do do it so even if you have really

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,279
good internet and you're trying your

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,779
possibly hardest at some point you'll go

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,420
to flick the lights on and nothing will

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,430
happen and you go okay great is that the

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,089
light bulb delights which the internet

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,329
the router this that do iphone Telstra

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,910
now I don't know I can't find my phone

00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,300
in consumer grade components if you're

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,820
buying consumer grade components they

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,210
all the time I mean not to one person

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,570
but when you look at them globally they

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,600
fail very very often so it's it's a

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,730
constant process of things failing and

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,950
having to be replaced another big

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,690
problem I was talking about esp8266 is

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:23,080
this morning and i mentioned i have like

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:24,490
96 mega RAM on board they have most of

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,510
that is used up in the process of

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,370
actually just getting the thing to do

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,570
its day-to-day job there is not a lot of

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,390
room in there to handle things like

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,880
encryption keys that are famously very

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,920
very heavy processes to be to be dealing

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,620
with you need a lot of RAM put aside so

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,060
that you can take these keys and process

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,910
things with them and send them back out

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,160
again if you want to serve SSL you have

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,470
to deal with many keys from each person

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,760
talking to you and many connections from

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,920
each person who keeps that connection

00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,570
open so they can reuse that key those

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,980
little chips are not good at this and so

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,490
people tend to back off a bit and say

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,850
SSL we don't really need SSL it's only a

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,410
light bulb I mean who on the internet

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,060
would ever groove someone by turning

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:08,500
their lights on and off 13 times a

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:10,630
second again it's the Internet who would

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,250
ever break into a sewage plant and dump

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,500
a million liters of raw sewage into a

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,370
river people have done that yet there is

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,810
it's the Internet so the decrypt o

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,280
supporters often patchy even when it's

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,050
there it's often patchy because these

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,430
devices have very little entropy to play

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:29,260
with I was going to mention it if you if

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,820
you just type in Internet of Things and

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,170
entropy you'll find it anyway there's

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,470
some interesting papers out recently

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,120
about this entropy is is for those of

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,860
you who don't know what entropy really

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
means randomness that you have to get

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,100
from somewhere if you're doing to

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,620
generate random numbers they have to

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,630
come from somewhere so you can pick it

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,620
up from a hardware random generator you

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,780
can pick it up from the environment

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,120
stuff like that if you're a cpu about

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,900
this big you have very limited access to

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,520
to generating good randomness and most

00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,090
cryptography depends on really good

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,650
randomness so these papers are talking

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,030
about how to gather entropy from the

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,890
environment effectively and all that

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,780
sort of stuff this was a huge problem in

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,680
Linux virtual machines up until a couple

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,240
of years ago

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,890
for exactly the same reason they live in

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,620
this very isolated to the world with

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,589
very little going on around them and

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,120
where do they get their entropy from

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,820
it's just plain tricky to use protocols

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,960
like that on these little tiny CPUs and

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,760
it's not necessarily the most

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,290
appropriate model the other thing that I

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,089
didn't really give a bullet point to

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,620
there but the other thing that is a

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,620
problem often is that you've got a lot

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,500
of chatter when you establish a

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,870
connection to something over SSL you

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,880
connect up you do a key negotiation you

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,770
come back now you send your message now

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,990
you get a response noise that's a lot of

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,360
packets for a light switch if you think

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,100
about it this way the amount of power

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,040
that in the SPU's is pretty much

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,860
proportional to the amount of packets at

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,959
sins that's the heaviest use of power in

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,560
the device so the length of time the

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,260
battery lasts is proportional to B

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,459
inverse of that so if you can send half

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,959
as when you package your batteries last

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,330
twice as long or you can make them half

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,640
the size so it's really worth looking at

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,010
these things they seem like silly

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,540
Network nerd erry kind of things where

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,550
you're saying oh let's code golf this

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,130
protocol so it can work in one packet

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,779
but in actual fact every single packet

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,800
you send is costing you battery life so

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,600
it's worth worrying about and the

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,250
software is awful we've just talked

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,770
about closed source management systems

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,150
for PCs and noted that they are terrible

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:39,050
things that look like they were created

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,940
in the 80s at NCSA mosaic kind of levels

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,190
of HTML we have the same problem with a

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,690
lot of devices they're written in a

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,830
hurry by people who'd rather be making

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:54,020
hardware we have instances of light

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:56,029
bulbs that run linux we have huge

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,220
vulnerabilities opened up as a result of

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,020
this and it's not well he's kind of the

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,350
vendors fault they made it they sold it

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,970
but it's also inevitable if you take a

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,410
bunch of people who would really like to

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,420
be making light bulbs and you say to

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,829
them here make a secure linux server

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:15,529
that's easy I'm sure they're not going

00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,149
to do a great job right the software is

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,589
often patchy or software is often flaky

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,690
there's a brilliant article here linked

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,290
with by Matthew Garrett about these

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,970
particular I rainbow light bulbs

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,320
where he looks at just how terrible they

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,700
are i think his title is something like

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,200
i bought some light bulbs off the

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,970
internet so you don't have to and on the

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,900
one hand he's slightly cruel to these

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,580
people on the other hand they got a

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,990
bunch of his time for free and i think

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,760
frankly they should be thankful for it

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,740
because he's done a really thorough

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,510
analysis of exactly how bad their

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,100
product is and it doesn't take much to

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,190
take that and turn that into a series of

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,930
lessons you could maybe make it better

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,580
now you could say well that's alright

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,410
light bulb manufacturers will lift their

00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,220
game the second thing I've linked is an

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,170
article about those proximity card door

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,640
locks that are everywhere so you've

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,470
probably seen a thousand over in your

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,150
life if you've ever worked big companies

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,190
and how they're all completely

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,350
compromised to remote attack because

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,990
someone wrote a thing the piece of code

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,170
that flashes the little colored light

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,730
does a call out to a shell program based

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,230
on some information you pass them in a

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,130
packet and doesn't escape that

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:25,130
information so it is it is absolutely

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,560
web programming worst possible thing you

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,900
could do so yes you can basically get

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,300
root on your door lock by sending it a

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,100
single packet and have it openssh for

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,950
example to you because they also run

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,690
Linux so I think there is a lot of ways

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,880
in which light bulb manufacturers and

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,190
this is for a door lock right if door

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,070
lock manufacturers can't do it light

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,630
bulb manufacturers can't do it and the

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,120
last one I want to talk about is the

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,860
update cycles for these things no one

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,650
ever is going to reflash their

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,300
thermostat I mean okay occasionally the

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,030
people in this room might all right but

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,490
outside this room no one is ever going

00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,470
to do this the problem with this is it

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,880
seems silly right I mean yeah what are

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,900
the odds of me getting briefed by the

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,670
Russians in my thermostat right but if

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,740
my thermostat is an internet device

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,620
that's how distributed denial-of-service

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,240
attacks work right we've just had an

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:23,589
exciting time for the government

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,819
it is fair to say exciting times where

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,050
we've talked a lot about distributed

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,100
denial-of-service attacks and one of the

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,610
things I've cities are launched by

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,260
foreign powers etc sure you can you can

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,870
shut off the entire world outside your

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,400
borders it doesn't help much if you're

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,950
having being attacked by a million

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,600
Australian thermostats that are in the

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,059
same house that they're trying to

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,460
fulfill the survey from there's no real

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,620
way you can firewall against that right

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,240
and these things are in a very

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,370
privileged position there on your local

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,290
network in your house they have a great

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,730
position to man in the middle things and

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,740
do all sorts of other tricky attacks

00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,300
because they're members of your network

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,280
you have welcomed them into your network

00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,400
and now they're there it's very

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,750
difficult to say what they shouldn't

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,790
shouldn't be allowed to do the other

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,679
little minor point is while these

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,240
devices are reloading their flash or

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,640
whatever if you do over upgrade them

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,470
they're generally unavailable and just

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,120
like whenever your Android phone is

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,950
updating itself there's an important

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,090
phone call you're waiting for it's the

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,920
best way if you have an important phone

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,020
call go an upgrade your phone they're

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,340
bound to ring while it's upgrading the

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,620
same thing you really don't want your

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,240
thermostat your lights etc to all stop

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,179
working while you upgrade your firmware

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,190
that's very depressing you'll also

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,530
notice there isn't a later button on

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,000
this particular dialogue so in this

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,140
particular case the person complaining

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,490
about this on the aforementioned

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,140
internet channel was complaining that

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,400
having discovered there's an upgrade for

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,290
his light bulbs he has to do it right

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,960
now can't wait can't change a light bulb

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,850
in the meantime nope do it right now

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,960
this could be inconvenient if it's for

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,070
example the middle of the night how do

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,460
we turn these complaints into

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,230
requirements well I think there's a case

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,679
there that we need to be independent of

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,480
the the big I Internet we're still on

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,850
the very edge of the little I Internet

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,130
we're still internet working we can

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,960
still talk between multiple networks but

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,059
should we be dependent on an entire

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,470
global infrastructure to switch a light

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,809
bulb on and off or to regulate a

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,280
thermostat I think there's a pretty

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:24,070
strong argument there to say that we

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,800
really just shouldn't rather than having

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:29,100
everybody reinvent the light bulb or for

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,090
that matter the gps tracking protocol or

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,170
every other protocol in the world

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,690
perhaps we should agree on

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,250
some standard protocols this has

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,500
happened like once before in the history

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,380
of humankind as far as i know we call it

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,510
the internet it's everywhere now the

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,330
networks that pre-existed before the

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:50,390
internet were things like the Microsoft

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,400
Network and aol's internal network and

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,140
in a lot of companies things like banyan

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,270
vines or netware and things like that

00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:03,860
who's used any of those products lately

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:07,580
oh right so in practice open standards

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,680
sometimes do win sometimes good triumphs

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,820
over evil and we can just take some

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,510
inspiration from that I think it's

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,120
possible that I OT could do this if

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:19,370
people start thinking about it now I

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,860
I've spent some time working with the

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,960
internet Engineering Task Force are the

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,750
people who to write internet protocols

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,770
ip6 and TCP and all of those sorts of

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,330
things these bodies are the right place

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,590
for this discussion to be happening and

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,510
this discussion needs to be sort of

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,610
moved in there and they're just starting

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,350
to talk about this stuff now but the

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,090
companies that are generating these

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,350
products and expanding into this space

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,330
really need to be part of that process

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,890
the idea isn't to tell people what to do

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,530
the idea is to bring them into the

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,450
process I think we also need to be

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,930
talking about a simplified cryptography

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,730
regime SSL I don't think fits well for

00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,750
this thing I think when we need to be

00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,940
looking at a much more simplified

00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,990
cryptography thing otherwise everyone's

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,750
just going to go it's too hard we just

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,410
won't do it and with email we've seen

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,540
how well that turns out and really

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:11,300
development shouldn't be as hard as it

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,770
is if you look at the the effort

00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,220
involved in writing C for a

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:19,640
microcontroller it's quite significant

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,290
if you look at writing code for say

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,940
javascript in a web browser it's a lot

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,130
easier and one of the reasons we had

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,730
this in sex potion in the web is also

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:30,650
open languages open libraries and be

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,220
able to look at code understand what

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:37,010
it's doing and all of that sort of stuff

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,480
in terms of potential solutions well

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,509
that turned out really badly on this

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,070
slightly shrunk screen but anyway

00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,159
I think the thing to look for is a

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,209
peer-to-peer communications game

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,889
basically having your light switch just

00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:50,919
wake up and broadcast the fact that it's

00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:53,349
been toggled rather than going out to

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,849
some server on another network I think

00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:57,399
we need to look at a standards-based

00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:59,139
hardware description language I think we

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,969
need some kind of shared secret based

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:02,679
encryption thing these are all just

00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:04,719
ideas based on those requirements I

00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,299
think the most important thing to do is

00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:08,829
to nail the requirements down first but

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:12,999
these are some ideas to as a jumping-off

00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:14,289
point um and given where we are I

00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,289
actually think it's a great thing to

00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:18,579
have platforms languages like micro

00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,579
pious and available for these platforms

00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:24,309
it's much much harder to code a buffer

00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:26,589
overrun in Python it's a great deal

00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,619
harder to make many of them really easy

00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:33,219
mistakes to make in pie in C in Python

00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:35,049
there they're much it's much more

00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:38,949
abstract layer and so you're protected

00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:41,409
from a lot of those mistakes Django is

00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:42,789
two doors up but nonetheless Django did

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,319
one great great thing when they

00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,739
developed it which is this whole string

00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:51,059
escaping thing that's built into it it's

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:54,639
actually harder to make that mistake of

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,729
interpolating user information into an

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:59,679
SQL query or into your HTML in Django

00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:02,829
than is to not because it by default

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,719
wraps things up so these higher levels

00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:07,509
of abstraction can protect you somewhat

00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:09,429
against making the obvious mistakes all

00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:11,259
right we've got some time for questions

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,739
and comments and so on and so forth i'm

00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:19,289
happy to take questions or comments

00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:19,289
that's fine far away

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:45,320
questions anyone okay the question is

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,270
what you say is correct and I'm quite

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,840
convinced but is there any alternative

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:54,680
to it like can we avoid it any

00:23:50,840 --> 00:24:00,380
alternative to Internet of Things well

00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:03,380
yeah I think I think you don't have to

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,840
accept that Internet of Things is just

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,390
the bad things about things I think in

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,400
the same way as you could say that the

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,500
internet would be a bad thing if we were

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,100
all locked into only ever using one

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,320
thing from one vendor right if our

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,150
vision of the internet meant that if you

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,410
downloaded windows if you're used

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,930
windows on your computer you can only

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,980
talk to Microsoft servers and if you had

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,330
an apple you can only talk to Mac

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,220
servers and that you never connected

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,960
that would not be a good internet that

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,610
would be a bad internet I think

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,100
similarly we can have a good internet of

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,230
things where things cooperate things

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,540
work together we can actually be secure

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,310
and have things work properly all the

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,590
time or get have a bad one where

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,390
everything is flaky and horrible what's

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,790
interesting is I think that the bad one

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,470
will never really really work I think

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,000
people will get burnt by it too early on

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,220
in the cycle and they'll walk away from

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,220
it now go now look I had one of those

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,200
smart thermostats it was rubbish so it's

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,110
actually in manufacturers interests in

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,740
the longer term to make a better product

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,910
that is safer and more secure and

00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,130
sometimes vendors need a little leading

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,190
around a little pulling by the nose to

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,520
remind them of this but generally they

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,870
get there eventually you know and I

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,920
think there is a potential for the

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,720
internet of things to actually improve

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,310
some things I actually really like you

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,550
know you see these very silly examples

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,510
if I walk in and all my lights turn on

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,010
that's actually kind of cool when you

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,190
think about it the idea that a house can

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,710
respond to what you're doing as a very

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,330
simple example I have a my place as a

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,570
some windows in the roof the clothes

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,460
when it rains that sounds really silly

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,890
until you live in melbourne and

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,240
you discover that this is often the case

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,520
you want to leave the windows open so

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,669
that the house airs out but you want

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,500
them to close so that when it rains it

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,179
stop staring at you nor to be really

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,669
nice to be nice if the air conditioned

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,020
and you about that because then it

00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:55,700
wouldn't get all confused by the fact

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,679
that the air pressure inside has just

00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,990
suddenly jumped up as the windows closed

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,090
and you can say maybe I'll just turn

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,549
myself down a little bit at this point

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,049
things like that having those devices be

00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,580
able to talk to each other is actually a

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,620
really good thing and there's actually

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,320
big industrial applications for this too

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,020
if you look at a big a big factory a big

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,990
plan they have many many systems all of

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,419
which don't talk to each other and so

00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,500
there's actually huge non-domestic

00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:26,990
potential for this sort of stuff as well

00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:37,760
so I do think it's possible any other

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:39,049
questions hi so you said that you kind

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,270
of mentioned that security is quite a

00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,220
large issue in this area um what are

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,230
some ways that people and developers in

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:50,020
general can have approached this into

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:52,909
the future very very carefully yeah look

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,070
it's becoming less of a pressure as the

00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,990
chips get faster and more power

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,270
efficient and bigger RAM and all of that

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,159
sort of stuff I think the thing to do is

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,130
to have a look at the primitives we're

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:07,279
using for encryption on those n devices

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,039
and decide SSL is kind of a very

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,090
one-size-fits-all solution and but to

00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,429
have a look at that and go when we

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,820
better off having individually signed

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,960
packets over UDP or something like that

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,669
that's tricky it means you're taking a

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,549
lot more responsibility on it means the

00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:25,190
incident as a whole has to get some

00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:26,990
experts to help us out but there are

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,360
plenty of experts out there there are

00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,799
some great people on the internet if

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,480
things are open standards people

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,340
contribute to them even people who you

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,860
were otherwise never be able to in fact

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,380
higher because they are excited about

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,000
open standards there behind open

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,649
standards and this is one of the things

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,080
you get out of these big standards

00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:48,590
bodies is that the people involved with

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,389
them are running at those kind of levels

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,470
you know you're not just having someone

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:53,240
like me go

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,510
that sounds fairly good from a crypto

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,789
point of view I guess that'll be okay it

00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,049
might be it's great to be able to take

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,280
that to someone who really does know

00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,650
what they're doing who is actually a

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,630
professional cryptographer and say to

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,799
them okay like I think this is right

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,210
based on like reading your book but have

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,530
I missed something is there something I

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,700
need to do there and I think by making

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,950
this an open standard you get to

00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,929
leverage that every manufacturer doesn't

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,230
have to do this themselves if we come up

00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,750
with an open standard that covers many

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:27,070
manufacturers everyone can benefit from

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,510
that and everyone can contribute to that

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,299
so I'm going to take the security thing

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,270
and turn it the other way around cool so

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:37,730
given that we have at this point a lot

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,650
of very very badly programmed and badly

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,770
constructed Internet of Things devices

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:45,620
yeah what are some of the ways that we

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,690
can mitigate the impact of those devices

00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,940
going bad and going rogue on our own

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:54,470
networks you take them you put them in

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:57,080
the recycling bin yeah it's it is a

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:01,280
major problem especially if you've got I

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,340
mean I love Linux to bits but linux is a

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,110
big hairy operating system and if that's

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,600
what's running on these devices you have

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,880
often got very very many vulnerabilities

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,100
from all the way from having a telnet

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,570
port open so I want to actually go out

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,370
of their way to do that you know I've

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:20,600
been and devices with password a one two

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,000
three you know this these are not

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,530
uncommon flaws you could go through hack

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,120
into each of those boxes using one of

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,429
those vulnerabilities and then shut that

00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,419
vulnerability down it would be a little

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:34,130
time consuming though and you know other

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,020
people aren't going to do it the big

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,750
risk is is not so much you personally

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:49,720
because you probably haven't annoyed

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:52,070
anyone as much as what the wood yeah

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,900
that's right it's ed it's a target-rich

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,210
environment and and I don't know much

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,289
you can do to mitigate it beyond

00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,850
actually kind of hacking into your own

00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:01,370
hardware which of course will void its

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:04,419
warranty and so on and so forth it's

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,419
only kind of yours right

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:11,170
the example you gave the internet it was

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:15,130
an interesting one because the the

00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:17,800
networks that it replaced compuserve and

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:19,870
yep AOL and so forth came about after

00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,760
the internet already existed and was

00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:27,400
working and the internet itself was not

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,990
created or promoted by corporations

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,050
acting in their own interest it was it

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:35,230
was a government project how would you

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:37,350
seize an example like that applying to

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:40,390
the Internet of Things replacing these

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,860
systems which where the easy thing is to

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,720
centralize that the easy thing is to put

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,380
it on a server controlled by the

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,700
corporation not to come up with an

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,820
industry standard where everyone gets to

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,840
contribute it is the easier option so if

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,810
you look at the history of the internet

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,570
the very first internet seen ARPANET was

00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:00,640
was indeed a government project etc etc

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,240
if you look at the history of the recent

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,810
internet that is very much a child of

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:12,940
cisco and sun and IBM and Microsoft even

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:14,350
well they come to meetings generating

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,540
this thing between them if you look at

00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,570
the Heather have a look at the authors

00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,660
of rfcs from about a thousand onwards

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,010
and you'll see that the the things that

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,840
the people who've been driving these

00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,420
processes are buying like funded by

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,220
these big companies and most of those

00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,410
people don't really necessarily act

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,900
specifically in the interests of their

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,790
big company they act any interests of

00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,140
the internet in a way that will help

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,290
their big company because it'll make the

00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,060
internet yet so I do think there's hope

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,740
there that we can take what we've

00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,080
currently got in kind of bootstrap it

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,020
into something better standardized and

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,580
better working the problem is that all

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,140
the small companies have a lot of

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,540
trouble getting represented and at the

00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,890
moment iate stuff has a lot of small

00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,520
players in it and those small players

00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:02,410
don't really have much of a chance of of

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,360
representing themselves so I'm not sure

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,630
how we can we can make that happen but I

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,490
think the the the thing to do is to at

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,940
least come up with some solid proposals

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:15,340
about what would be better how do we

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,630
avoid these problems and take them out

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,960
there and say look this is the open

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,820
stand

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,289
this is this is where things are going

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,820
it's not something that can happen just

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:24,640
in this room it's something that has to

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,049
happen in this industry but this is a

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,690
good place to start talking about it

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:31,380
right cool thank you very much please

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,380
