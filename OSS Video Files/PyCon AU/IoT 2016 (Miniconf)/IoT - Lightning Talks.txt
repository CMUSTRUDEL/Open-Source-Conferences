Michael I like IOT things I like

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,790
everything to a ot and yeah so I've got

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,740
Twitter on there and you can get me on

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,590
slack so what I'm going to talk to you

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,240
today that is some work that I've been

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:25,529
doing with Python and some sort of

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,449
different IOT devices so a lot of you

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,189
guys probably have played around or seen

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,570
like these little things the we Mo's

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,230
they're just small little IOT devices

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,690
turn power on and off it's all sweet but

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,420
what about larger devices things that

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,170
are a little bit bigger maybe turn off

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,780
more power so we've got power stations

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,840
they're like IOT devices they're usually

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,090
connected to the Internet in some form

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,410
and they're a large thing do they count

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,140
as I OT but I don't really care about

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,820
that their small-scale for me what I

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:10,159
care about is the mem the National

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:14,369
Electric market or operated by amo now

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,310
it is has all that started published

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,960
online and you can access that and for

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,590
me that's a thing it's it's still a

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,060
thing so that's sort of what I like to

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,970
play around with so the data is

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,320
available publicly on neb web com today

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:39,030
you it's a great website except all the

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,700
data is in zip files and inside those

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,210
zip files a CS fees and inside those

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,310
CSVs are multiple tables so it's a

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,720
little bit of a pain to sort of process

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,590
any of the starter and do anything

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,659
useful with it so i created this thing

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,479
called named my little dog very

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,530
creatively named that process of the

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,689
data you can then use it to query you

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,129
can do graphs you can select specific

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,840
things you got power stations you can

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,740
pick your favorite Power Station see how

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,240
well it's doing you can rang

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,650
all the power stations see which one's

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:22,020
the best and more importantly you can

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,990
get environmental data so you can see

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,890
how much co2 we're putting out or how

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:33,660
well hydro is going doing compared to

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:36,470
solar and other solutions the other

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,580
thing i like to do with it is tweet so

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,530
one of the things they have the market

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
notices so if something bad happens on

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,870
the the network or if something bad is

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,020
about to happen on the network they send

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,190
out a market notice and it's sort of

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,070
really annoying to get to at the moment

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,560
but by feeding it to Twitter people can

00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,810
look at it get push notifications they

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,350
know instantly when something's about to

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,390
happen so that entire thing is done in

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,300
Python but the current implementation is

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,020
terrible it was done over 34 days that

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:14,010
is a bit of a proof of concept I'm now

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:17,250
redeveloping it in a more pythonic way

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,450
so you can separate some of the tasks

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,070
are use the date of your own use so yeah

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,630
if that's something that you're sort of

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:29,340
interested in yeah you can help out give

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,420
me a hand I have no idea what I'm doing

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:48,000
so yeah that'd be great so yeah that's a

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:51,260
that's it any quick questions all right

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,260
thanks very much that's great

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,480
cup for you and keep you I did it for

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
the mob

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:41,449
alright this talk is not about Internet

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,009
of Things that's the bad news the good

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,160
news is it's only five minutes long so

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:48,979
it can't be that bad right this is

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,099
called fear of the bus is about

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,960
documentation and DevOps and why you

00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,639
should be doing a better job of

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,650
documenting the things that are in your

00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,419
head right now because everything is

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,770
going to go terribly in the very near

00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:05,449
future when you get hit by a bus

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,630
obviously that happens all the time so

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,460
frequently in DevOps we are running as

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,229
fast as we can keep up with the crazy

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,610
programmers or sometimes we're the crazy

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,680
programmers and we're trying to push

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,330
stuff out as fast as we can but no

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,539
matter what we don't have time to do

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,599
documentation that's ridiculous the

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:25,580
problem with that is that all of the

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,380
pointers to the information that you

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,720
have carefully put online or stored in

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,909
your head it's like having everything in

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,880
RAM as soon as something happens to you

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,159
the information is as good as gone it's

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,620
just meaningless bits written somewhere

00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:42,740
that we can't point to it so if you get

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,509
hit by a bus it's all gone and we don't

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,830
know how to reconstruct the work that

00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,599
you've been doing please don't let it

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,479
make us do that because we're really sad

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,210
about that whole bus thing so write it

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,009
down I want you to think about what you

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,960
could do to document what it is you know

00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,780
so that people can replace you which is

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,270
a scary thought but it's not gonna be

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,740
that bad you won't be around to notice

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:10,039
it what are the things that you can do

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,099
on a team is make people rotate their

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,630
duties for figure skaters we make them

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,190
skate in the opposite direction and they

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,419
complain about it a lot but you have to

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,460
strengthen up your legs in both

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,400
directions or else you sort of have one

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,860
giant leg in one week leg same thing is

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,259
true for people who doing multiple jobs

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,180
you have to rotate around and spin what

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,520
you're doing and keep building new

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,020
muscles and if you've ever done a

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,270
push-up program you know the building

00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,889
new muscle sucks and is terrible but

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,409
you're grateful later because news flash

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,900
we all work in the corporate world or

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,729
not all of us but a lot of us and we

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,039
could be fired at any moment and walked

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:49,159
out with our cardboard box of shame and

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,550
whoa and then nobody knows what's going

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,840
on in man

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,240
suddenly you're left with nothing but

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,550
this blank signal where there used to be

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,430
a person who knew het where everything

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,960
was have you ever had that moment I have

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,860
you're like oh so don't let anyone do

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,689
that as a documentation person I care

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,419
quite a lot about the horizontal and the

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,129
vertical as a DevOps person I don't give

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,870
a fig what you do as long as you've

00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,389
written it down somewhere I don't care

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,800
if you put it on the bathroom wall as

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,349
long as you tell someone that's where it

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,270
is one of my favorite tools for doing

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,830
this is called Bassam mecke because it

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,860
looks really sketchy and unfinished

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,210
people are a lot happier modifying and

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,189
altering things that look unfinished

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,020
that's something that looks polished and

00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:39,080
done so if you're going to do something

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,169
make it ugly just put it in one long

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,840
page that somebody can search and pile

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,150
things on top like just push down the

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,490
old stuff and pile the new stuff on top

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,650
and eventually somebody will search

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,029
through and find what they need this is

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,379
a terrible way to do professional

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,469
documentation but it works for this

00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:59,180
application because we have amazing

00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,430
things he can go through books like this

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,409
and find specific instances of

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,089
information but hopefully not your

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:08,270
password because you shouldn't put that

00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:10,639
in that's the one thing I talked to a

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,409
team that was using slack for most of

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,990
their communication and they had a

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:18,050
designated icon that they put next to a

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,400
designated emoji con that they put next

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,409
to something that should go in the build

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,389
book and so they could just search for

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:26,080
the icon and find it and put it in the

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,009
build book but what matters is you put

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,199
documentation wherever your team is

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,269
already communicating not that you make

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,740
them go out of their way that they have

00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,349
to go out of their way to avoid

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,870
documenting something because we're all

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,959
lazy and how do you check that you made

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,600
this work the chaos monkey the chaos

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,300
monkey randomly designates someone to go

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,800
on vacation for a day or three you take

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,890
away their phone you lock them out of

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,370
email it's as if you fired them and they

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,769
are forced forced to relax possibly like

00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,630
fruity drinks or something something's

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,020
going to go wrong something will catch

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,400
on fire but it's a drill and you can fix

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,560
it

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,720
because they're not actually fired you

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,840
may not be able to build but I tell you

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,220
what the the drill you go through is

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,470
going to be a lot less stressful than

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,240
when Maria's in the hospital and you

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,960
really can't get to her because she's

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,760
doing something more important then

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,450
you've drilled on it you know what you

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,670
didn't know in conclusion putting ducks

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,190
on your devops saves you from having to

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,080
put a picture of the Hindenburg on your

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,180
status page because you went down

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,550
because you didn't know what was going

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,910
on you should really try and avoid that

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,530
because nobody likes it that is my five

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:50,500
minutes on why should be doing a better

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:54,090
job of documentation I love the thought

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,090
of allowing developers to go on holidays

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:04,980
there any questions all right moving

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,980
right along

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:20,510
okay horizontally scalable actors in

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,130
Python I made this presentation about

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:27,680
five minutes before putting my hand up

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:34,220
so apologies for the low quality there

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:40,210
we go so Erlang yay very scalable based

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,210
on the actor model and passing messages

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:53,830
works multi nodes in past messages

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,830
between nodes all well and good yay

00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:01,520
sadface I'm OTP which is the framework

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:06,590
online uses unreliable past about 60

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:10,970
nodes it's extremely unreliable and it's

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:17,780
not Python so I decided I'd try and

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:19,580
build an OTP for Python mq TTFN it's a

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,030
peer-to-peer messaging protocol very

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:27,460
similar MQTT but doesn't need to have a

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:33,170
centralized broker and using a sink I 0

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:36,770
for all the act of stuff ends up looking

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:47,770
something like this so server one that

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:55,040
py oh don't need to look up this so yep

00:12:47,770 --> 00:13:01,310
import actor node link node link it sets

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,870
up a little listening address and an

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,900
actor which is basically prints out

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,260
whatever it gets sent by a message move

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,890
to serve a two node link connects up to

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:16,780
the previous one sense hello world

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:20,570
that's going to print out hello world so

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:23,020
yeah I didn't quite get to the demo it

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,020
didn't work

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:41,870
so that's going to have to be the end of

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:43,459
my presentation but cool we can look

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:51,500
forward to the demo at the next lighting

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:55,149
talk that we have any questions I think

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,149
we're up to our final lapping talk

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,950
alright is this working excellent so

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,250
I've been playing around of micro Python

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:40,180
for you know a few months now and always

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,980
bemoans the lack of an easy way to get

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,240
code in and out of it and a couple of

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,950
weeks ago like literally two weeks the

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,020
odd kayden kross move it's a basically a

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,680
really simple editor for micro quite

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,470
designed around education and it was

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,610
originally written for the BBC micro bit

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,370
but I've sort of forked it and got it

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,630
working on the esp8266 this little

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,600
device five bucks from China so I'm

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:08,950
hoping that they'll get merged in to the

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,780
branch to the main fork at some point

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,150
comes with a file manager so you can

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,240
easily drag and drop your files across

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,620
you can do it all via the web connection

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,660
so to actually even need to plug the

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,310
thing in if it's working in your ceiling

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:29,240
as a temperature monitor you can do your

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:31,220
code by your Wi-Fi and today I wrote a

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,860
very polluted preliminary debugger in my

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,770
spare time it just runs your code line

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,800
by line into the ripple but it lets you

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,360
actually see what's going on so no one

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,270
we just have to you know you know we

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,800
have to deal with the print statements

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,650
it's just a proof of concept right now

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,180
but again we'll see where it goes and

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,790
and the whole thing is actually written

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,400
in Python so you can get in and change

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,810
it which is what I found two I came into

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,450
this two weeks ago I've never done the

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,120
GUI programming and it's actually dead

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:06,680
simple just to get in and change it and

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,110
QT makes this surprisingly easy I was

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,480
sort of scared of it but yeah good

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,960
simple um we need people to you know

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,060
test it to use it to play with it and to

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,520
break it if you feel like contributing

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:25,790
the forks are there um it looks like if

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,840
I can show you and look something like

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:32,000
this there's um yeah basically a code

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,710
pain um this is sort of in debug mode

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,460
which I've just thrown in very very

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:40,930
rapidly and haven't added any pictures

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,930
in but um yeah you can

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,380
Apple sorry I've just started using an

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:51,389
apple in the last thumb week and

00:16:48,380 --> 00:17:03,060
struggling with it I'll struggle with it

00:16:51,389 --> 00:17:07,410
still getting used to let's say yeah all

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:12,380
right um yeah let's hope the code is all

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:16,250
pretty straightforward that's it for me

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,250
