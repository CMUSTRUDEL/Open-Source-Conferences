um Lee thank you for joining us hey

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:28,080
awesome now this is a bit of a different

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,240
format a bit of a different way of doing

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,309
things but we wanted to practice our

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,540
streaming muscle so to speak because

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,160
this year PyCon online is going ahead

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,750
virtually and I'm really excited for

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,399
this so to talk through a little bit

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,350
about what a virtual event looks like

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,320
what our vision is for pike online are

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,530
you and and what you can come to expect

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,910
from our digital event we're gonna have

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,920
a chat through about what we're

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,949

running pike online a you this year so

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:11,640
pipeline au is being run by mostly the

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:16,530
the original team that was scheduled to

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,820
run - a ye in Adelaide this year made

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,830
the plans bird event recipe soon plus a

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,229
few a few extras because we've had as

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,750
everyone's been experiencing people are

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,259
losing jobs having kids having to be

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,470
looked after

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,630
we're all volunteers people have have

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,329
had to had to step back as well I think

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,150
we've been able to step forward so if

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,869
there's currently eight of us myself

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,290
infinite director William Brown as my

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,700
co-director we have royal Collette who

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,630
in so you have to be attending

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,270
experience the no rice is our Robin

00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,840
program chair Jack Skinner is a

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,969
communications coordinator Katie

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,299
McLaughlin has has come back to help us

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,940
happen sponsorship Russ Heath McGee is

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,760
once again as Python a use business dad

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,990
okay treasurer and the Liddy Barry is

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,900
however a member at

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,240
and she is running around and doing all

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,980
of the excess stuff that we don't have

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,680
titles for which is actually a really

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,880
even things I have on the tape

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,730
absolutely and it's been really

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,010
fantastic to see from my perspective not

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,020
just an existing team pivoting to an

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,760
online event but really seeing a lot of

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,680
members of the community come to support

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,450
that core team there's been lots of

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,210
conversations behind the scenes of how

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,950
can we help and you know it's it's not

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,450
enough just to list a couple of names

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,620
here there's lots of people behind the

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,680
scenes that have been hugely supportive

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,350
so as we sort of massively pivot from

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,350
hiring a huge venue and flying everyone

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,240
into going online and joining everyone

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,400
in the comfort of their own home office

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,590
or their couch it's it is a mammoth

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,560
effort and so it's a big shout out to

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,790
the team behind the scenes there so what

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,290
on earth were doing on this stream

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,150
tonight well we're not going to take too

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,850
long but we're really starting this

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,160
series of news updates via video to

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,900
practice our streaming muscle we need to

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,780
get better at this so that we can put on

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,460
an awesome show for all of you

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,410
and that means we're going to be doing

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,240
normal news announcements so you can

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,160
expect to go to the website to social

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,860
media to the mailing list and get news

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,560
updates but we also want to follow up

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,360
and do video experiences just like this

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,850
as a bit of a Q&A is a bit of an

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,910
interactive format where we can say hi

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,380
throughout the next few months before

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,750
well should we just put the spoiler out

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,020
there before our official conference on

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,580
what are the dates Lee so the dates we

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:51,150
are going to be holding pike online a

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:52,800
4th to the 6th of September so the plan

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,920
is we're having a slightly shorter pike

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,560
on we have the fourth and the fifth will

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,660
be our two main conference date service

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,210
week so on the fourth we are planning to

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,400
have our specialist tracks as

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,600
traditionally been held on the friday of

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,010
python ru v will be our our main

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,230
conference which is condensed down to

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,420
one day and then on the 6th of September

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,120
we're going to have our sprints as well

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,040
it's in social events that's a really

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,630
good summary I want to highlight there

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,780
that this is going to be a slightly

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,800
shorter time period for a conference we

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,020
had lots of discussions about how to put

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,210
together a really awesome virtual

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,400
experience and one of the things we were

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,740
all mindful of is that we're all sitting

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,810
in front of our laptops all day every

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,210
day and that's not a great experience

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,190
when we're gonna do it over the weekend

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,289
as well and so we want to be mindful of

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,389
everybody sitting there stationary we're

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,889
not walking between different parts of

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,830
the conference menu anymore we're

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,090
clicking between videos and that's a

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,759
really different way to interact with

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,310
everyone and so yes it will be a shorter

00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,409
period of time if a few days shorter but

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,500
we're really intentional to bring all of

00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:04,120
those key elements of app icon and bring

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,129
them online the specialist tracks as you

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,129
were saying the sprints the the sort of

00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:14,430
core schedule we want all of that to be

00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:16,930
available online to everybody and so

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,090
who's going to be speaking well

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,039
that's down to a CFP now the next

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,590
question for everybody is when is the

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,229
CFP now do you have any dates that you

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,129
willing to commit to or should we be a

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:32,349
little bit ambiguous there I have a date

00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:37,449
we have a date in our internal calendar

00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:39,310
but I'm going to say soon so we're

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:43,330
planning to get that role at all well

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,159
like we did this next week yeah and what

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,259
I want to share with everyone is that as

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:51,130
we rapidly put together this online

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,930
project CFP is absolutely our next big

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,000
rock to move and so hopefully we'll have

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,150
some news for you in the next couple of

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,169
days let's say safely within a week what

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,930
I'd like to do though is set the

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,779
expectation of CFP being available

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,340
throughout the end of June so regardless

00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:08,740
of when we announce it over the next few

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,449
days everybody will have an opportunity

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,819
to think creatively about what they'd

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,639
like to submit to put together a really

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,770
awesome proposal and then at the end of

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,680
June and into July we'll have a really

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,500
clear closing date for CFP and hopefully

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,819
in the nicest way possible our papers

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,440
committee will have a really difficult

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,240
time going through all of those

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,680
proposals as they do every year I think

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,379
it's a it's always a really difficult

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,930
process putting together the schedule

00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,580
and the selection but now is the time to

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,180
start thinking about what you would like

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,660
to present at Parc online au and

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,300
think with that said and it's it's

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,090
always tricky to put together to pick

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,410
out the best talks out of a sort of

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,889
really good talks and with our

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,330
conference being shorter that means

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,330
we've shortened it for a reason but it

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,550
does mean there is the potential for the

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,949
amount of submissions that come in to be

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,500
as larger images that is usually and

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,150
that that's going to mean a lot of

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,310
difficult decisions it's gonna turn into

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,070
a really great really great quality

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,050
conference it will and you know in all

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,030
of these discussions we are extremely

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,889
mindful of trying to create the same

00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,530
experience that people have come to love

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,479
and expect from PyCon and bring it

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,860
online and so even though that selection

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,990
process is going to be even more

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,610
difficult than always we still want to

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,130
make sure that we're supporting as many

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,990
people to put forward an idea to speak

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,330
we're going to be going through the same

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,800
motions to support first time speakers

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,539
and to really make sure that our

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,430
speakers have an amazing experience

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:41,919
sharing their insights and their wisdom

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,900
and their expertise at Pyke online at

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,310
you now I'm not going to go into the

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,520
full details of what we're planning

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,990
that's for a CFP announcement but if

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,479
you're watching this stream you've been

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,250
to a few PI cons in the past and you've

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,250
been thinking about submitting this year

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,460
don't let a changed format stop you keep

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,289
thinking keep drafting your CFP and

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,500
we'll have some announcements over the

00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:08,099
next few days I want to turn now to talk

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,960
a little bit about sponsorships

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,039
obviously an event like this

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,970
historically would have a massive amount

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,759
of expenses

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,229
and this year it's a bit different but

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,620
we're still looking to bring on board

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,270
some sponsors so Shirley can you talk us

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,849
through a little bit about what our

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,620
sponsors can expect where they can go to

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,409
learn more if they're watching or

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,000
perhaps if you know of a sponsor if

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,349
you're viewing this dream and you'd like

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,820
to introduce us we'd love to talk to

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,229
them so talk to us a little bit about

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,339
the sponsorships and what they can come

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,229
to expect so we're looking to try and

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,860
offer the same sorts of things we

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:48,040
typically offer sponsors as well as some

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,140
new and different things that they sort

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,180
of don't necessarily fit in within the

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,160
constraints for physical efforts it all

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,170
sort of brick and mortar

00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,019
building so we'll have sponsor logos and

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,850
plenary mentions and mentions on the

00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:06,649
website all of that sort of thing as per

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:09,120
usual there's also the opportunity for

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,160
sponsors to hold events before or after

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,129
the conference and to have those event

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,689
market and very conference for people to

00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:17,879
drop in and learn a bit a bit more about

00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:22,170
a bit more about your products if you're

00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:25,199
as if you're a responsive and there's

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,449
what detailed all of that as well as a

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:30,389
handful of other things that I am I'm

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:37,470
sure I'm forgetting to mention at 20:20

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:40,500
a cons order they use sponsor and head

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,839
on over yeah in some email and Katie

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:49,980
will be happy to have a chat to you and

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:52,019
sort it out it's a good point you know

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,480
there's lots of aspects of a conference

00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,370
that are branded or sponsorship

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,610
opportunities and things like lanyards

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,959
are very different in a virtual space we

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,339
would also love to hear from sponsors

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,250
that want to do something fun something

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,560
different something digital we are not

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,029
the exclusive experts in digital events

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,610
we're learning and we're very open to

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,339
those ideas and those suggestions and so

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,220
if you're our our platinum sponsor out

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,410
there looking for a really interesting

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,209
different experience for attendees we'd

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,100
also love to chat to you because we want

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,529
this to be as fun for you as it is for

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,519
everyone dialing in and viewing as an

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:32,029
attendee I mean the curling will create

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,579
sensation last year and year before was

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:38,059
incredibly popular and that was an idea

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:40,500
that a sponsor came to last you see with

00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,449
sorry I'm I'm actually quite interested

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,860
to see if if we get in these months as

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:44,699
they come in with them we haven't

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,620
thought of that

00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:49,470
it makes the event better for everyone

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,370
that is a fantastic example and as

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,079
you'll have noticed throughout the

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,910
stream I am a fan of the curly boy I

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,100
have my curly boy mug here for the

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,870
conference and yes so so if you're a

00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,819
sponsor out there that is interested in

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,649
connecting with the Python community in

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:03,329

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,309
