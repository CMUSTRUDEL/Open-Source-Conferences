hi everyone in the next few moments I'm

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,690
gonna chat to you about a conference we

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,089
have coming up and how you can submit a

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,829
talk for it Emily and about three years

00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,570
ago I sat at Bowdoin Pike on a you in

00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:17,280
twenty twenty play como you is

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,990
Australia's peak Python conference and

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,820
my team and I have a lovely plan to

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,880
bring it right here to my home city of

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,330
Adelaide but 2020 had other ideas so

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,919
despite all of this we're doing it

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,960
anyway on the 4th to the 6th of

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,330
September so while much of this

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,700
conference is my fault I'm here with our

00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,550
program chair bene who is in charge of

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,140
selecting the talks that go into it

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,309
thanks Leigh so this year we are online

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,489
very online

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,960
one might say extremely online in fact

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,420
we've even named the conference Pike

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
online a you that means some

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,949
opportunities but definitely a lot of

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,390
changes obviously everything's online

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,519
all presentations will be via video

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,109
stream either live or pre-recorded which

00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,190
means it'll be a bit different but we're

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,219
doing our best to keep the feel of the

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,929
conference the same yeah so for lots of

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,390
people PyCon au was their first time

00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,130
public speaking me included and we pride

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,500
ourselves on having a range of voices on

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,840
a range of topics so your talk to be

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,549
massively technical or python e if you

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,900
think it's of interest to the pet to

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,780
community we're interested in hearing

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,860
from you so in addition to the main

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,360
conference we've also got five

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,640
specialist tracks these are sort of

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
smaller focused mini conferences they're

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,979
the same kind of ideas we've had in

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,450
previous years but because we're not

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,520
limited by the number of rooms we have

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,020
we've got more of them so this year's

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,850
specialist tracks include Django Connor

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,369
U which is not just about Django but

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,049
anything web ish security and privacy

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,509
which is not just about not getting

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,890
pwned data Sciences analytics which is

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,439
about crunching numbers and all that fun

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,270
educational out learning and learning

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,360
about learning and DevOps which is about

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,070
failure and learning from that so if you

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,170
have an idea and you want help turning

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,659
it into a table you can talk to us and

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,610
we can introduce you to have mentor head

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,320
on over to pythons or old do they use I

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,640
speak and check the details about

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,170
connecting with the mentor there and

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,460
remember the more submissions we

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,049
received the more difficult it makes

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,250
donors life in a few weeks time when

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,289
