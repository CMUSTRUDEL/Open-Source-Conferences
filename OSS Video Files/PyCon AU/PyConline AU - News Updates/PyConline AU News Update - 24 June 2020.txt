faces joining me for a bit more detail

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,490

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,890
tonight I have the amazing organizers

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,410
behind Django Khan Australia data

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,480
science and analytics and our education

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,970
specialist tracks hey everyone thanks

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,730
for joining me

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,410
so it gets a bit complicated having

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,840
multi-directional online conversations

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,160
so I might say thank you to the team and

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,850
but for now I want to have a quick

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,850
conversation with Marcus all about

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,200
Django Khan a you Marcus it is really

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,579
good to see you again on stream it's

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,969
been a while since I've seen you face to

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,289
face and it looks like you're

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,460
delightfully outside tell me about

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,280
whereabouts in the world you are right

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,449
now Eric yeah it's been about a year I

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,579
guess I'm in Berlin Germany so that's

00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,039
more than hammers that's summer right

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,339
now we have lovely 28 degrees or

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,830
something outside and yeah it's it's

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,729
sunny that's fantastic and for these two

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,570
dealers that's not a delayed no that's

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,250
about 10,000 miles 16,000 kilometres

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,960
from Adelaide Oh Sydney

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,930
for me what I love about having a

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,119
virtual event like this is we can bring

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,250
people such as yourself in and be part

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,829
of the fantastic Park online a you

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,540
community and the specialist tracks now

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,290
that's a really cheesy segue into

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,240
talking about Django con a you now don't

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,790
tell anyone but Django can I use one of

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,810
my favorite specialist tracks so why

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,670
don't you tell me a little bit more

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,470
about it and why people should get

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,200
interested in submitting a talk to

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,850
Django Connor you project them I'm

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
flattered that you see jinguk on

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,110
australia's your favorite conference

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,390
because it's definitely it's one of mine

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,610
as well and one of the reasons why i'm

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,399
keep organizing it so general khan

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,280
Australia happens for the eighth time

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,649
and it's a conference one-day conference

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,530
about Django the Python web framework

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,959
but it's not also only about Django it's

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,930
also about Python in web development in

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,740
general in Python and as a Python

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,130
community in

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,210
communities often is very open to like

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,220
other development ideas and approaches

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,440
it's been a historic thing for John

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,540
Connor you to bring in ideas from

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,030
outside the Django community so we've

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,390
had talks about rust last year and

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,090
groobie JavaScript we had to Drupal in

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,930
the past and other Python web frameworks

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,150
and yeah jingle corn is a conference

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,770
where their community the patent django

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,560
web development community gets together

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,830
and talks about all these different

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,860
topics about all these yeah the whole

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,840
point of web development and all the

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,010
things you can do with Django I think

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,570
that's a really important point to

00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,770
highlight if you're joining the stream

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,120
and it's your first time you may have

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,130
heard about us at some meetups

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,930
throughout the last few evenings where

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,310
we've been really emphasizing that idea

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,030
that our specialist tracks aren't

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,890
exclusively just for the topics in which

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,290
they're named but really a lot of the

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,510
encompassing ideas or ecosystems and

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,460
communities around those sorts of

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,860
projects and I think Django con ru is a

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,290
fantastic example of that where I've

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,660
seen you fully embrace web tech as a

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,780
whole and of course how it relates to

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:32,490
Python and Django so in your viewers

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,230
sorry in your opinion what are some of

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,390
the things that our viewers in this

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,980
evening stream should really take away

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,980
from this and what should they be

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,970
excited about Django Connor you after

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:49,890
Connor you said it's a conference with

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:52,110
very specific talks on on specific on

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,590
specific topics in and around the web

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,690
development and environment and while

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,870
it's targeted towards Django it's not

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,960
just covering Django so if you are

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,380
looking for talks on Django definitely

00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,690
subscribe to or attempt and django con

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,260
Australia this year if you have

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,049
technology or experience then also

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,350
submit to our CFP because we're still

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,020
looking for talks and if you have a tech

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,140
experience or ideas how to bring django

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,870
forward or how effects have experience

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,200
with web frame

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,230
outside the Python or the jingle area

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,870
then and think there's value in there

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,720
that's Django should definitely embrace

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,260
or that would make Django better please

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,200
submit that as a talk as well and when

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,820
you submit to talk then Piko ants or if

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,380
you are thinking about submitting a talk

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,560
but I'm not a particular issue about it

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,380
and may need some help or want some some

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:59,120
advice then the whole pie corner and I

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,770
you team has mentors available and yeah

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,190
the only thing I can really ask you for

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,520
is submitted hawk because or not just

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,710
one maybe two or three or five like if

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,479
you have good ideas submit them the more

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,190
talks that people submit the more

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,010
difficult it is for our papers committee

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,720
to to review that process and trust me

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,310
that's a really good thing

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,520
in previous years it's been a really

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,500
difficult process to decide on the final

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,110
cut for talks because there's so many

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,400
fantastic ideas that get submitted so I

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,810
love that so there's there's three key

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,419
things that I heard you say it's get

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,050
excited about the tech and web in

00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:37,520
general we do have mentors so if you are

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,560
submitting to a conference for the first

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,419
time or you're a little bit nervous

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,490
about an online presentation that's a

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,919
bit different we've got blenders reach

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,890
out to us you can go to Pike on.org that

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,440
I use slash speak it's down there down

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,900
there there we go and we can help you

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,160
work on your CFP early and be encouraged

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,419
to submit to the conference and to

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,580
django con au

00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,900
marcos this has been a fantastic chat

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,330
but we have some people waiting

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,220
backstage to have a chat about data

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,960
science and analytics so thank you for

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,330
joining me Marcus I will see to the

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,789
stream and next up I'm going to welcome

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,830
Rachel to the call rachel is really good

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,200
to see you how are you yeah you too Joe

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,450
I'm great thanks how you going I'm

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,570
fantastic and now I want to open with a

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,430
little secret data science and analytics

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,530
is one of my favorite specialist tracks

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:30,710
at PyCon but the others can get jealous

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:34,070
so yes great to hear because it's one of

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,930
my favorites to just just like yeah like

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,180
education is pretty cool Django is

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,620
pretty good but yeah it's always the

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,220
science a diet attractor they end up

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,010
paying out

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,720
the most absolutely so for everyone

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,340
viewing the stream why should we be

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,460
excited about the data science and

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,310
analytics track I it's just such a big

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,310
area that's coming up like this so so

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:59,270
many directions that the track can take

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,590
like we've had in previous years you

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,310
haven't wasted talks on like the

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,160
nitty-gritty I knew packages or doing

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,850
like overall comparison of all the

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,520
visualization engines because there's

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,810
always something new coming up but then

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,940
you have the talks people talking about

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,970
the case studies and things they just

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,350
cool things they've done and there's

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,020
always those talks that make you think

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,790
that

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,470
like for example privacy privacy is a

00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,710
huge thing that's coming up in this area

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,950
or implicit biases in machine learning

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,840
algorithms that that's just all of this

00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,750
stuff we have to care about and it's all

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,850
in this one track that's a really good

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,530
point and and and one of the things I

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,320
think I'm taking away from that is that

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,820
one of the big moments about data

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,419
science analytics is some of those

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,669
really cool but curious moments for

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,740
examples from people you know who've

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:56,720
done some of the work and lived in the

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,310
trenches so to speak yeah definitely but

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,950
we want to be clear we we don't want

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,810
talks just from experts with 10 billion

00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,780
years experience doing all of these

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,570
complex ml starts like we want to hear

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,640
from everyone like people who are newer

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,490
newer to the area can give their own

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,530
unique view on what happened or what

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,140
they think should happen to people who

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,820
are like from a different context like

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,590
science is part of our name we want to

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,560
hear from people who are working in

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,030
science and to see or whatever area

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,250
they're coming from and using data to

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,160
see what their concerns are what they

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,310
use data for what what can we learn from

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,630
other areas yeah so some of the bullet

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,969
points I've got here really sort of

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,640
highlighted the tools the processes and

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,800
the policies could you break that down a

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,420
little bit for me maybe to inspire some

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,589
of our viewers as to talks they might

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,500
want to submit sure I okay let's let's

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,970
look at it so tools so things like the

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,990
cutting-edge things I what I've talked

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,940
about a bit already

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,089
scene learning deep learning the data

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,660
visualization interactive dashboards but

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:04,190
also foundational topics because ml okay

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,649
that's been around for 20 odd years or

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,930
something by now but the statistics and

00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,120
there have been hundreds of units and

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,470
there's still stuff we can learn from it

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,740
and newer ones too like machine vision

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,930
natural learning processes anyone who's

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,399
worked in any sort of data field knows

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,529
that eighty percent of the job is

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,260
basically cleaning up data and getting

00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:30,640
it available weird to know what you do

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:33,260
like how do you get that data to you to

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,480
work with and then how do you hand it

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,040
off to people because we don't work in

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,230
vacuums we have to work with various

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,270
stakeholders and how do we present data

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,870
in such a way that they can make sense

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,330
of it

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:51,290
and lastly policies so this comes back

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,690
into the ethics and it's not like not

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,790
just how do we do the things we do about

00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,470
why what are our concerns what are we

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:03,829
hoping to do with it I do yeah ethics of

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,959
data research is a huge thing now that's

00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:07,730
a really good breakdown so for people

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,800
that are considering submitting to this

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,290
specialist track or to Pyke online a you

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,050
in general what sort of tips or

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,430
takeaways would you share with viewers

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,170
over the next few weeks as we have our

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,750
call for papers open a call for

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:24,320
proposals

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:26,959
number one talk to if you are a bit on

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,520
the fence about it or contact the

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,899
mentors there's a great team of mentors

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,190
who are wanting to come and help you

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,990
refine your idea and even if you don't

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,910
think it is much of an idea reach out

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,490
come and talk to us and we can help you

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:44,839
get that idea into something that could

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,579
be really exciting submit early there

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,589
there's a lot of talks coming and you

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,920
can always edit your talk after the fact

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,690
and I always find when writing talk

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,310
proposals I keep on thinking of new

00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,690
things to add in and it's like ha but

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,390
what if I change the name to be like

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,620
this that would be such a good name

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:04,640
absolutely I'm the same in that regard

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,890
yeah there asked me about changing names

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,880
of talks three minutes before the CFP

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:12,470
closes don't be like

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,540
me do it early very important and submit

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:18,080
to both PyCon online the general chat

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,430
and the specialist track data science

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,990
and analytics might be the best track

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,030
but the other tracks are pretty good as

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,800
well look the other tracks are really

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,050
good thank you for joining us Rachel

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,000
that's a fantastic segue to introduce

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,350
the last of our specialist tracks this

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,480
evening Rachel thank you for joining me

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,400
I will bring in a stream

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,530
I'll bring into the stream Nikki and a

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,330
man that Nikki Amanda thank you for

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:45,140
joining me how are you anything on the

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:50,360
fly never goes awkwardly at all seamless

00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:53,030
seamless as always Jack sandy now look

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,670
don't tell the other tracks bit of an in

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,250
secret is that education tracks one of

00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,570
my favorite moments at PyCon au and of

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,520
course it's gonna be no different this

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:06,170
year for pike online and you it's my

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,940
favorite thing - along with all of my

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,630
other favorites but definitely favorite

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,330
I'm really excited about it this year

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,640
and being online gives us a really

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:20,060
fantastic opportunity especially with an

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,610
education focus to include a bunch of

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:27,680
voices that are just really difficult to

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:29,300
hear from in an in-person event so we're

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,470
particularly excited about getting

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,760
regional teachers folks anyone who's

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,950
interested in education and of course

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,560
students as well talking at the

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:42,130
education track this year I love that

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,210
angle to really include a different

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,820
cohort because it's it's a difficult

00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:50,900
access the community in the conference I

00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,190
really love that I sometimes but it's

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,740
much easier when it's in your living

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,380
room when you don't have to travel

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,880
indeed so Amanda can you tell me a

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,920
little bit more about who should be

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,120
interested in the specialist tract for

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,370
education okay so it's what we cover is

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,130
anything that relates to teaching Python

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,530
its secondary or tertiary that are

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,510
judged in the past of her teachers we've

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,760
had lecturers we've also had some

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,820
industry specialists sharing experiences

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,270
what worked what didn't work or we all

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,300
need to hear about Courtney

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,790
tails and so we've using Python in the

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,790
classroom but also how to make Python

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,930
work for them to make their lives and

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,670
jobs easier so maybe I'll ask you Nikki

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,950
you know with that in mind what are some

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,570
of your favorite moments from the

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,420
education track over the last few years

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,640
probably can't say all of them can I

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,280
know maybe your top two or three well

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,070
we've had like games and micro pythons

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,660
and really cool technical talks I love

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,700
the I tried this and it's failed

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,570
spectacularly talks because you'll learn

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,550
so much because they're such a diverse

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,260
audience there are so many good things

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,670
about hearing talks about how to use

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,270
Python in the classroom outside the

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,560
classroom in an extracurricular activity

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,530
but really probably my favorite thing

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,810
about the Education Showcase is the

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,670
student showcase so every year we get

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,590
students high school students come in

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,650
and share a cool thing that they've been

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,150
working on and that's been fantastic

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,890
neural nets and darts shooting robots

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,240
and natural language processing speaking

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,770
to my heart

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,630
so many fantastic cool things fantastic

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,520
now we'll touch on the the student

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,180
showcase in just a moment but I'm really

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,620
curious often we hear these topics in

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:43,380
regards only for educators for example

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,140
is this only for teachers to attend it

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,640
really isn't only for teachers teachers

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,860
get a lot out of it and it is geared

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,350
towards education but anybody who's

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,500
interested in the education landscape

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,590
and curriculum so often we get quite a

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,420
lot of parents and people who have

00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,190
children but they're developers and want

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,190
to hear about what's happening in

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,980
schools but then also people who mentor

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,800
young developers and people that are

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,740
learning the pitfalls and the promise of

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,780
Python and so what they what they're

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,390
going to get full over at what their

00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,040
what the misconceptions are how to guide

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,340
somebody through that landscape that's

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,460
that's another part of our audience and

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,140
and so then to maybe flip that question

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,680
on its head do you have to be a teacher

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,870
to submit to talk no absolutely not so

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,590
anyone who's interested in education

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,640
whether that's

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,440
teaching-learning or just doing cool

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,220
stuff that they think would fit in an

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,420
education environment we want to hear

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,090
from you if you've got something to

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,890
share we really want to see a diverse

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,180
set of people and that means that

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,670
they've had a diverse set of experiences

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,460
with whatever Python and education is

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,880
and how it can work together and those

00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,170
are fantastic mentoring opportunity as

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,060
well we can pair you up with someone

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,010
who's done it before if you're not quite

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,350
sure how what you're gonna say and how

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,090
you're gonna say it yeah that's that's a

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,190
really good point I know that you know

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,050
pivoting from in-person events to

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,360
presenting to a very small webcam on top

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,610
of my monitor here is a really really

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,590
different and challenging experience and

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,810
so if there's people out there who might

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,190
have a really exciting story to tell a

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,410
lesson they've learned and they'd love

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,660
to share it we do have mentors available

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,070
at Parc online au this year to help you

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,900
be the best presenter you can be now you

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,400
mentioned the student showcase earlier

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,500
and I remember seeing some of these

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,440
moments last year and it just put a

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,180
massive smile on my face could you take

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,000
a moment to tell me about the student

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,240
showcase so we want to highlight some

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,580
fantastic things that students are doing

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,680
across Australia and beyond there's

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,720
really started by a couple of teachers

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,300
who encourage their students to submit

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,500
to the normal education track and they

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,950
were just fantastic and we thought let's

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,080
make a thing of this they're shorter

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,790
pictures usually about five minutes and

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,370
really we just wanted to give a platform

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,650
for students to say hey I worked on this

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,270
thing it's kind of cool and I want to

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,000
show it to you it doesn't have to

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,740
actually work a hundred percent we just

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,750
want to say what what students are doing

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,910
across the country and I will admit

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:26,170
they're really cool you have to have a

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,610
fantastic amazing next little thing we

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,280
just want to hear what what you're doing

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,840
yeah and it doesn't have to be in the

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,730
classroom and it doesn't have to like it

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,440
could be from the class remote could be

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,180
a personal project that someone's just

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,640
got passionate about either of those

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,010
work yeah there's there's certainly a

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,050
sort of infectious enthusiasm that comes

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,880
from some of those those talks and those

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,460
showcases I really love those moments

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,050
so quickly Nikki can you take us through

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,610
a couple of the quick topics that people

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,890
might think through in terms of

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,640
submitting a talk to the education

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,770
specialist track so we love hearing

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,270
about classroom experiences or about

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:08,200
extracurricular experiences about how to

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:11,410
teach particular topics or watch what

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,630
experience you've had with is

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,360
object-oriented design right for high

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,250
school students how do I streamline

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,350
working with modules how do I even get

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,360
Python installed on the computers that

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,570
my school uses what I'm not allowed to

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,170
install pipe anything on them machine

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,600
learning really anything a Python foot

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:35,450
primary school students right up to

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,820
education at in tertiary education we

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:42,110
want to hear any stories about education

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,730
I love it so are there any last messages

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,100
or takeaways that you'd like to leave

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,950
with viewers this evening Amanda I might

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,860
pass to you on this one yes so first

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,320
thing is you do not need to be an expert

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:57,320
if we waited for only experts to present

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,820
nobody would ever present so be excited

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,850
about the thing that you've done and

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,490
tell us about your experiences we have

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,160
mentors you must know that you are

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,890
supported through this so if you head on

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,350
down to python.org today you speak I'm

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,870
funny the wrong way that way and work on

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,070
your CFP early and ask for help if you

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,930
need it

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,400
we are expecting lots of people to

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,620
submit their zfg's tagged with the

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,390
education track and we love sorting

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,420
through and finding the absolute best

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,020
ones for everybody that's fantastic

00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,910
thanks Amanda

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,530
now before we bring everyone back to the

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,900
stream I just want to take a moment to

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,730
talk to that specialist track at moment

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,740
for the student showcase if you're a

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,600
student watching this dream or perhaps

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,060
you know a student who'd be answered to

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,040
submit to the conference the normal CFP

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,750
process is not the right place to do

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,880
that just yet so we're gonna have some

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,680
news about how to submit specifically to

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
the student showcase and we'll be

00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,550
sharing that over the weeks to come the

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,260
takeaway for you right now is that it

00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,030
will be happening where we're looking

00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,990

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,350
