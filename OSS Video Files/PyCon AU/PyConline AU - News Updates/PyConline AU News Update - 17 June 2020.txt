	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
hello and welcome to another Pike online

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,990
au newsdesk

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,340
discussion so we'll start slowly to make

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,010
sure that all of our viewers can come

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,590
across from social onto the stream but

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,120
on today's conversation I have mr. Benn

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,539
Oh rice joining me Ben oh thank you for

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,189
joining us Ojeda I'm doing really good

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,560
actually it's really good to hear your

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,000
voice in these distance if I work from

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,699
home times it's really good to catch up

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,170
with the techs yes now it's one of the

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,429
things I miss about the whole Pike on

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,199
scene is just getting together with

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,399
everybody and so it's it's I'm really

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
glad they were actually being able to do

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
something this year even if it doesn't

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,550
let us you know hang around in in

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,500
hallways as much as we here have done in

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,910
the past well we'll do our best to make

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,969
sure that there's a hallway tract of

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,160
sorts a segment in September yeah um now

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,870
absolutely you and I and the team have

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,570
been working furiously over the last few

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,309
days to make sure that today we could

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,100
announce our official call for proposals

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,469
and alongside that we've announced the

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,090
specialist tracks so before we talk

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,739
about the CFP I want to just have a

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,719
quick chat to you about the specialist

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,280
tracks that we've announced and what

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,170
people can come to expect from those

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
tracks now looking through some of the

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,220
announcements that we had today there's

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,500
five specialist tracks but in the past

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,790
we've only had a four what's new and

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,710
different well I mean so obviously due

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,170
to the whole you know pandemic thing

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,140
getting in the way of having physical

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,150
events means that we haven't been able

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,950
to have an event that's in you know

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,600
rooms with theatres and stages and all

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,740
that kind of stuff but that also means

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,960
that we don't have to limited ourselves

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,189
by the number of rooms that we have and

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,689
so we decided to expand the number of

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,640
specialist tracks that we had this year

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,659
partially for that reason and also just

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,259
to make sure that we've got a nice

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,549
breadth of content coming into the into

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,189
the process and into the conference

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,509
itself fantastic and so what we're

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,310
really saying is that it's not

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,619
necessarily a new or different format

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,180
just that there's a different space and

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,570
a different opportunity for people to

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,860
share their exciting talks with us yeah

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,790
I mean it's it's you know it's part of

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,520
your whole when life gives you lemons

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,990
kind of thing you know though we don't

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,979
have the opportunity to use theatres

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,239
this year but that means we don't have

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,080
to be limited by the number of them and

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,510
we can just have as many different

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,040
things going on as we want fantastic

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,659
it's a pike online au flavour

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,489
lemonade yay so that's really exciting

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,920
for everyone watching that would like to

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,000
get to know the specialist tracks a

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,609
little bit better

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,189
they have been updated on the program

00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,989
page on the website but as a sneak peek

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,879
we're also planning and doing some more

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,709
of these new streams with dispatch

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,439
specialist track teams themselves so you

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,359
can get to know what their topic area is

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,819
what their special interest area is and

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,769
what they're really excited for at Parc

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,030
online are you this year and so we're

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,280
not going to go into them in too much

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,470
depth today all the details are on the

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,970
website but look look to this stream

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,849
next week and the week after for those

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,519
conversations now I want to turn to our

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:59,310
CFP now a call for proposals is a

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,510
massive part of the conference so it's

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,489
not going to be possible for us to go

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,439
into all of the depth and detail right

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,780
now but a couple of things jumped out at

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,329
me such as the session types of the

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,970
format now historically we've had normal

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:14,220
and normal anthem in deep dive talks but

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,470
I notice with you short talks up there

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,720
as well talk to me about these 15-minute

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:24,419
segments so historically PI cons used a

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,729
sort of a 25-minute for 30 minute type

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,859
slot some conferences have had longer

00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,329
slots and there was a bit of request

00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,379
that we have longer slots and so in the

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,479
last couple of years we've been running

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,609
the deep dives sessions which allow

00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,430
people to go a lot deeper into a subject

00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,949
as the name suggests what we thought

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,889
we'd try this year as well is giving

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,049
people who have a bit more focused

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,370
presentation sort of a shorter idea a

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:53,040
quick hit if you like a space to

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,709
schedule that in there so it's going to

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,180
be a bit like the deep dive talks have

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,939
been treated in the past and that will

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,220
assess how many of those we scheduled

00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,930
and you know on what our what times

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,780
based on how many of those proposals we

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,519
get but if you've got an idea that you

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,970
think can be expressed in a shorter

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,650
timeframe and want to give that a go

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,139
then we've got a slot for you this year

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,930
right so I think the important thing we

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,340
want everyone to hear today is that when

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,979
you're submitting to a certain type of

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,320
session like a short talk you're not

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,029
competing for a fixed quota of those

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,900
that we've predetermined it we really

00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:29,940
want to make the schedule

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,880
work for the submissions they get get

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,240
put in yeah and I think also with a an

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,800
online conference I mean in a

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,990
traditional conference you can get up

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,090
and walk around you can move around you

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,370
can see different things in an online

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,810
conference you're going to be sitting in

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,190
a chair a bit more and so we want to

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,350
have a bit more variety in the

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,870
presentation so having a couple of quick

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,840
hits between some larger topics I think

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,800
is it could be a lot of fun I love it

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,160
now

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,169
deep dives an opportunity to get really

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,310
super technical and explore a topic in a

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,930
lot of depth and that comes all sorts of

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,910
opportunities to do things yeah

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,070
workshops and hands-on labs or does it

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,690
well I mean obviously the hands-on stuff

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,720
this this year is going to be a bit

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,949
different I mean I we are more than

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,630
happy if someone wants to propose a

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,830
workshop to try and make that happen but

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,470
we're gonna have to work within the

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,400
constraints of the medium that we have

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,449
you are going to be talking to people

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,360
you're not going to be able to walk

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,860
around and help them this necessarily

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,750
you might have to be a bit more active

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,190
in chat if someone wanted to propose a

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,860
workshop session that happened entirely

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,810
through the hallway track chat system

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,240
I'd be more than happy to help them

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,810
workshop that idea but a deep dive

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,849
session is going to be a lot more about

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,740
getting value for the time than it is

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,449
about just you know if you're worried

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,520
that you've got a 25-minute talk that's

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,260
going to run long come and talk to us

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,430
and we'll help you work out how to fit

00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,840
that in the twenty five minutes as

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,139
opposed to just spreading it out into a

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,750
55 minutes slot if you've got an eye if

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,370
you've got a dense block of ideas around

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,289
a particular topic that you think is

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,880
worth getting into in depth then

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,340
absolutely pitch that at a deep dive

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,409
talk and we'll talk to you about it if

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,949
you're not sure what the best fit for it

00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:19,050
is our email addresses on the CFP site

00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,909
and along all the communications it's

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,580
out there it's program at PyCon dr. day

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:26,909
you reach out to us and we'll more than

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,199
happily talk to you about you know you

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,169
can ask your questions and we will give

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,800
you the answers as best we can yeah

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,810
fantastic

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,900
and I think something also that I'd want

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,539
to highlight there is that the deep

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,210
dives are not you need to run like a

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,930
product demo so to

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,360
no help people run workshops like that

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,580
but we've got some packages that we'd

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,610
love to hear from you about and social

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,789
early balance between really great

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,979
exciting technical deep dives and some

00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:00,139
more brand aligned that we can help

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:01,970
support and promote alongside the

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,349
conference yeah if you want to be a

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,319
brand promotion then you want to talk to

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:10,280
the sponsorship folks historically we've

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,930
not been big on product pitch talks that

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,949
doesn't mean that you shouldn't talk

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,720
about a product that you think is

00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,970
interesting just that if you're selling

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,750
a product we're not gonna be

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,550
particularly interested in ads that's a

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,910
real unless you're buying sponsorships

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,710
by sponsorships that's what makes

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,169
conferences like this happen so success

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,669
absolutely if you want to do that we

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,340
promise you that the more sponsorship we

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,669
get the more fun you will have excellent

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,710
now there's a really interesting

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,880
conversation being had in the chat by

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,830
the wonderful class 'end and I would

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,479
like to highlight that yes we have some

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,150
mentors this year

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,039
now Glasson is not in our chap here but

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,750
we actually had this completely scripted

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,690
right now so thank you for the perfectly

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,389
timed segue yay so we've got some

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,610
mentors for this year's conference trip

00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,349
was a little bit about mainly the CFP

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,930
process so over the negative three weeks

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,229
if I'm a first-time speaker or I'm not

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,219
quite sure what I should be submitting

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:10,729
what do we have on offer from a

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:13,460
mentorship program um basically if you

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,110
are if you have questions about the

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,630
process if you have questions about your

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,680
your pitch if you're worried about you

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,690
know if you want to have the best chance

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,130

worried about you know anything really I

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,890
mean proposing to the proposing to any

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,870
conference can be stressful I know I've

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,079
done it lots of times and I I still get

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,110
rejected I still find it you know I find

00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,980
myself second-guessing you

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,480
am i writing this in a way that's

00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,940
actually make me want to want them to

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,100
pick it so absolutely reach out to us we

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,769
will help you we want you to have the

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,600
best time that you can have I would

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,640
completely agree with that I have been

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,610
one of those mentors in previous years

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,260
and I'd like to encourage everybody who

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,240
is out there that thinks they have an

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,360
interesting topic or something that I

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,670
can share that would educate an audience

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,279
to think about a talk for pike online a

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,839
you the mentors are there to help you

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,269
make the best of this opportunity

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,040
they're not there to sort of tear your

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:31,170
idea apart and say no you shouldn't do

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,930
it that way they're there to take your

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,870
spark of imagination your creativity and

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,140
your expertise and help you craft it

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,250
into the best submission you can make

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,500
yeah so they're really there to support

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,060
and help you absolutely and one of the

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,440
things that I really like about the the

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,149
Python community and the Python

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,000
conference community especially is it it

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:53,130
very much values lifting people up and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,930
helping them become better and so even

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,500
if it's that year you want to speak but

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,730
you having trouble formulating an idea

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,199
get in touch with us tell us the kind of

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,180
things you find interesting tell us the

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,949
kind of things that you do and we can

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,649
probably suggest a few ideas that you

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:09,510
can then try and develop into proposals

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,670
yeah absolutely and and that's a really

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,339
important point that the community is

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,980
there about lifting people up so if

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,980
you're a first time presenter absolutely

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,380
Pike on on pike online au is a great

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,350
opportunity to give your first talk even

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:29,160
if there's online yeah you don't even

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,779
have to leave your house now you know I

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,370
have done a number of conference

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,899
presentations over the years you've done

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,180
a number of conference presentations

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,519
over the years and yet presenting

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,430
virtually to a webcam and an audience of

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,540
0 is daunting it's different it's also

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,940
even well rehearsed at so we also want

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,860
to support presenters over the lifetime

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,170
of their talk a pike online are you not

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,510
just there's a text submission up front

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,550
talk to me a little bit about mentorship

00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,130
over the next few months before the

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,529
conference so we're going to also going

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,589
to be offering mentorship and support

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:06,600
for actually developing and delivering

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,339
presentations that are selected this is

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,120
kind of analogous to the financial aid

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,189
that we would have give

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,999
in previous years to support things like

00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:16,290
plane flights hotels tickets for people

00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,620
who need it

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,990
so obviously delivering a presentation

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,220
effectively over a virtual thing from

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,829
your house is quite different and

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,649
requires equipment it requires you know

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:30,749
a different way of presenting you don't

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,740
get the immediate audience feedback but

00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,999
then you also then have the bright

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,079
lights shining in your face unless

00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:39,779
you've specifically gone out and bought

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:41,430
them Jack I've taught for this dream but

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,379
I mean I want the things that I would

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,029
suggest there are that I wouldn't get

00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,410
too stressed about your webcam it's a

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,120
bit more it's more important for us to

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,809
see your slides and hear your voice

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,129
than it is to see your face necessarily

00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:54,959
in that I mean if you do have a decent

00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,920
webcam and you want to have your face in

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,899
the part of the presentation that's

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,329
absolutely fine but don't get too

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,949
stressed if you can't having a decent

00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,740
microphone is probably the best

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,449
investment you can make you don't but if

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,480
you feel that you can't afford one or

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,829
can't access one then reach out to us we

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,540
will help you find one whether it's

00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,129
begging borrowing stealing or even us

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,649
giving you some money towards getting

00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,999
you one if that's what it takes again we

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,249
want you to have the best experience

00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,449
that you can and the last one is that if

00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:24,929
you're worried about your internet

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:28,410
connectivity we do have the ability to

00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:30,120
play in pre-recorded talks we do have a

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,730
part in the CFP that in let's you

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,259
indicate whether you don't mind how you

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,879
present whether you would prefer one way

00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,499
or the other or whether you require one

00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,929
way or the other we're also happy for

00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:41,610
you to do test recordings and send them

00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,459
through to us just do 30 seconds of you

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,079
talking against in however way you

00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:50,730
wanted to present and we can let you

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,970
know we have the AV team that's worked

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,550
at all of the PI cons in that I remember

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,439
ever and they are excellent at their

00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,509
jobs and will happily give you advice on

00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:03,389
on how you can tweak your video settings

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:07,939
mic settings equipment whatever in order

00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:11,519
to get the best result component as well

00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:13,230
yeah and then in terms of content again

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,660
we will have mentors who can help you

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,110
review your content review your slide

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,389
designs you know help you if you get

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,180
stuck in the actual writing process we

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:27,350
can help all that

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,850
then III want to second that in terms of

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,980
rehearsals and practicing and testing

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,440
things out one of the benefits about

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,020
doing an online presentation is that you

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,480
have your presentation set up in front

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,250
of you right now you don't need to get

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,620
to the conference center and test it the

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,300
day before or the day of your talk you

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,130
can start to do this practice runs as

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,340
early as tomorrow morning when you've

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,990
woken up your great new idea and we

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,850
would love to be a part of helping your

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,200
talk be successful and so those

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,140
opportunities to test your microphone

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,510
test your webcam figure out your

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,090
internet stability this is one of those

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,490
processes that can be a little bit

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,770
haphazard there's no formal process for

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,390
it but we want you to be successful and

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,830
if you start thinking about that now

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,570
it's easier for us to give you that help

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,860
yeah if you ask for help you'll get it

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,760
if you don't ask for help you don't get

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,590
it and so if you're struggling if you're

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,750
feeling stuck please reach out we want

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,100
to as we've said several times we want

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,400
you to have the best experience as a

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,670
presenter as we can as we can help you

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,690

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,820
what you need help with excellent now

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,950
we've been talking all about this CFP

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,720
process but at least on the stream we

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,610
haven't really emphasized where to go

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,110
and learn more and so I want to make

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,260
sure that everybody here gets an

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,320
opportunity to go to the 20/20 icon au

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,690
org dot au I should actually fix that

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,230
that link coming up now but go to

00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,400
forward slash speak and you'll find that

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,440

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,560
call for proposals yes I'll show that

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,420

out that's hyphenated in the stream deck

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I know the icon - hey you dog do you

00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,250
it's it's not hyphenated just just to

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
emphasize to everyone that is line

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,940

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,120
midnight anywhere on earth which works

00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,350
out - since since PyCon au was meant to

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,310
be in Adelaide this year we're working

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:53,420
on Adelaide time and so that's 9:30 p.m.

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,340
Adelaide time on the 13th of July my

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,350
advice to everyone is don't go

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,370
submitting on the 12th of July submit it

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,830
much earlier submit early so it often

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,730
submit early and often that's right I'm

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,040
live on YouTube

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,590
early submit often and you can edit your

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,570
submissions as well and so if you're

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,610
wondering or is that the deadline is

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,260
that the only moment for me to submit no

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,120
you can go in there you can make

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,760
refinements and improvements if you've

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,680
been given feedback from a mentor you

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,500
can refine that right up until the close

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,570
time which is the 12th of July anywhere

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,000
