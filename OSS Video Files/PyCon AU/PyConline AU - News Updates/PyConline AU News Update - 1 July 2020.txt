and tonight's newsdesk update I have

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,380
with me three amazing guests we have

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:18,930
Chris Eliza and Justin thank you for

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,119
joining us how are you all tonight now

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,980
to keep this tight ship and to make sure

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,060
they can have a good conversation Justin

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm gonna pop you back down to the

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,560
greenroom and we'll have a chat to you

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,560
in just a few moments time don't go away

00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:36,840
awesome Chris Eliza it's really good to

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,480
see you how are you both going yeah it's

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,129
been an odd time it's great to see you

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,579
it's uh it's sad that we wouldn't get to

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,410
actually see you in person this year

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,550
indeed and and I'm a missing senior in

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,160
person but it's good to see you online

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,140
Chris how are you I'm doing all right

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,660
gonna miss you in the green bandanas

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,420
this year but we do get to tweet from a

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,219
distance so you are both of course

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,559
organizing our security and privacy

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,690
specialist track now before we get too

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,040
much further into this video I want to

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,320
let you in on a little bit of a secret

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,270
is that security and privacy is one of

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,729
my favorite specialist tracks at Pyke

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,470
online however don't tell the others

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,040
they just get a little bit jealous but

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,790
it's our secret your secret's safe with

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,180
us now last year I seem to remember you

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,500
had a snappy little tinfoil curly boy do

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,880
you have an update on how the curly boy

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,090
is going we do you'll find him on our

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,799
our track website snake-oil dot Academy

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,450
as we figured it was the most

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,170
appropriate thing for security and

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,610
privacy delightful I love it so Chris

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,439
tell me a little bit more about the

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,619
security and privacy specialist track

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,590
what makes it so special look I think

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,810
it's pretty special because it brings to

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,180
PyCon that a group of people and skills

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,579
that would otherwise not necessarily

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,530
present at a programming conference or

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:08,280
feel like they would necessarily be

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:11,149
valued at one whereas we think what is

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,149
happening

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,280
[Music]

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,670
just a moment please back with us now

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,520
about members of the community all right

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,250
yeah I just think that it's a great set

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
of skills that don't necessarily show up

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,510
a program in conferences very often so

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,300
we really want to make sure that they do

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:38,850
get along to PyCon and PyCon people

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:40,710
benefit from those skills I love it and

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,250
so how about you what what really makes

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,630
this special for you for me security and

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,370
privacy track is really special because

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,130
PyCon au was actually my first

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,740
programming conference and that was a

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,630
long time ago it makes me incredibly

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,420
happy that we're now having the

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,860
conversations about privacy of a profit

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,570
and defense-in-depth

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,090
and these are happening at programming

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,480
conferences not info SEC conferences not

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,100
operations conferences that's just so

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,940
exciting to me and it's so exciting to

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:17,400
see the Python and the Python community

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:18,690
embrace that I absolutely agree look the

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,020
world as we know it took a bit of a

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,100
sharp turn this year it is somewhat

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,459
unrecognizable from the 2019 that we

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,050
left behind how has that affected the

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,680
security and the privacy landscape as

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,480
well thanks to covered uh 2020 a has

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,180
seen like a massive increase in the

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,200
number of people working remotely

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,510
including developers and other people in

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,390
our sector so that means that that

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,480
personal security hygiene is now so much

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:49,170
more important than it traditionally was

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,420
so now personals a personal part yeah a

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,040
person's attacked factors are now your

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,580
business attack factors and that's just

00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,920
getting monumental as a huge yeah we are

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,230
really hoping to see talks from people

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,270
who have had to respond to that huge

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,709
change and how they've been sure they

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:12,450
can still work functionally and securely

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,700
we bet there are some great stories out

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,340
there about how people have responded in

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,010
good faith to covert but ended up with

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,419
new problems on their hands like the

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,750
reports we've all been seeing about

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,560
online fraud in ransomware and phishing

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,810
attacks using

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,870
oh that is the attack mechanism yeah

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,610
that makes a lot of sense I would love

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,040
to see some people that have been

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,290
involved in those those incidents or

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,750
have insight into those changes to

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,780
submit to and share their insights at

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,340
Parc online a you um you have any last

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,110
words of wisdom for people that are

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,060
viewing this stream or recording of the

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,590
stream and who might be thinking about

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,600
submitting to Pokemon are you but

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,740
they're not sure or they might not be

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,780
sure that security and privacy

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,660
specialists track is the right place for

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,340
their talk we want to make sure that

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,200
everyone who thinks they have something

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,910
to share feels competent in submitting

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,650
to the track or one of the other

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,510
specialist tracks even if they don't

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,810
necessarily think it's Python specific

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,540
because there are lessons to be learned

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,220
please submit submit early submit often

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,460
you can edit your submissions please go

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,100
to PyCon org slash speak there are

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,820
mentors available who are you know

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,870
willing and able to help you with your

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,850
hopefully new speaking career yeah even

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,070
if you've never presented that any of

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,350
these kind of conferences before we

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,539
highly recommend coming along icon a who

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,390
is easily one of the best places to be a

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:45,210
first-time speaker last year we had a

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,860
first-time speaker that was just wildly

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,440
successful easily one of the most

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,539
popular talks of the day you can check

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
that video out at snake-oil dot Academy

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,250
it's the one about the digital driver's

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,139
license and some interesting design

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,970
choices that led to some unintended

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:05,070
security consequences I love that talk

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,169
it was absolutely fantastic so I guess

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,840
if I think through this in summary get

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,580
excited about security about privacy you

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,860
know intentional design and thinking

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,630
about these things upfront and feel

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,760
empowered to submit to the conference we

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,340
love hearing from people who are perhaps

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,350
outside of the normal Python community

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,000
and have some amazing insights and some

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,310
wisdom that they can share from their

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,810
experience we do have mentoring

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,180
available if it's your first time

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,789
speaking at an online event or at a

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,280
PyCon au event and so take advantage of

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,919
that mentoring you can head to PyCon but

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,460
org dare you so I speak if you join me

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,370
over there there we go

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,720
us all the details about submitting to

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,500
the conference and the mentorship is

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,690
there CFP closes on the 12th of July so

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,520
you've got just shy of two weeks a few

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,710
days short of that to put your talk in

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,449
submit early submit often you can always

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,849
change your talk submission right up

00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,169
into the deadline Eliza Chris thank you

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,669
for joining me this evening I'm gonna

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,470
pop you back down to the green room and

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,300
we'll catch you towards the end of the

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,870
stream bye

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,590
and now joining me is Justin Justin are

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,050
you there my friend just just one second

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,020
something's gone slightly wrong with

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:22,720
what we got on here technology is

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,539
particularly difficult isn't it oh there

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,460
we go that's much better

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,990
almost getting some some early episodes

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,120
of Doctor Who vibes I wasn't sure which

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,860
timeline you're in there I don't think

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,659
any of us are quite sure what timeline

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,380
where anymore time has lost all meaning

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:40,720
it has indeed working from home now all

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,720
of that is a fun and cheesy joke about

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,909
DevOps but I'm actually the most excited

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,310
about the devil specialist track this

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,050
year it is a new addition to pi Connor

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,289
you and Park online are you I should say

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,719
and I'm really really excited about it

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,930
tell me more about what is DevOps

00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,460
all about well this is what happens to

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,560
you when you have silly ideas on the

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,789
internet you get volunteered into

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,310
running interesting tracks at

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,800
conferences so DevOps is all about

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,330
failure and a lot of conferences we like

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,919
to talk about how we did things and

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,719
built things and how well everything

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,340
went we don't actually spend a lot of

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,259
time talking about when things went

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,419
horribly wrong and there's actually a

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,580
lot to learn about what happened when

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,080
something went wrong and PyCon is a

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,509
great place for you to come and and to

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,159
talk about that so we want to get people

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,199
talking about their failures we want

00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,659
them to be open with what went on this

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,469
is a really welcoming community for that

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,890
kind of talk

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,390
hug ops is a thing so this is a great

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,130
place for you to be vulnerable about

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,289
something that went wrong in in your

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,789
professional life and to then help

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,250
everyone else learn from from your

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,560
mistakes I love that it's definitely a

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,990
trend we've seen more and more in tech

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,790
and in software engineering to

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,960
editorialize slightly for our audience

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,640
we've seen a lot of start

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,590
communities gather around stuff up

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,600
nights where they share some of their

00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,610
biggest stuff ups as a business and what

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,420
they've learned as a team but I also

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,830
think you know talking about failure is

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,170
vulnerable it's it's difficult it's it's

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,520
hard to talk about sometimes how do you

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,640
feel that this is going to play into

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,070
DevOps and the specialist track well

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,750
it's a couple of things so if for people

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,010
who are not sure about whether they

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,720
wanted to talk about this kind of

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,080
failure PyCon is the perfect place for

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,150
that

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,310
it's an incredibly welcoming community

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,170
there's a lot of investment has been put

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,960
in over many many years to make it a

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,520
very very welcoming place so if you're

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,500
going to talk about failures this is

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,420
this is an ideal audience to talk to

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,370
also if it's the first time that you

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,590
wanted to talk about something failure

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,570
is a great topic to talk about because

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,030
it's inherently interesting everyone

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,890
else loves to read or listen to people

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,450
talk about something that went wrong and

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,530
then what they learned from it and that

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,360
that's what we're trying to get out of

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,880
this is for people to be able to say I

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,740
did this it was it was horrible at the

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,960
time but now with a bit of distance we

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,760
can look at it and kind of learn from

00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,890
those things and say well actually this

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,170
is why that happened don't do this in

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,850
future maybe avoid this learn from my

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,600
mistakes and then we can all be much

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,460
much better at what we're doing I want a

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,230
second that I think Park online IU is

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,790
one of the most welcoming communities

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,490
that I've had the delight to work with

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,200
and be a part of I we start to see that

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,780
through a lot of previous events that

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,430
we've run but also through things like a

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,650
mentoring program for first time

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,840
speakers and for seasoned speakers as

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,880
well I think that's a massive part of

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,440
what makes our speaking of Park online

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,840
are you such a unique and special

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,850
process is that we really want to help

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,440
encourage people to do the best talk

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,500
they can and we've got the support

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,420
mechanisms to make that possible now I

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,820
said I was really excited about DevOps

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,760
but of course that means things are

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,970
gonna run perfectly right first time

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,180
specialists track digital format what

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,740
could go wrong I know right I mean of

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,960
course everything is going to explode

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,700
within seconds and that's just fabulous

00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,710
because then we've all got material for

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,900
next year and that's what we're

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,000
expecting is that this is a great track

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,240
to go and actually make mistakes in so

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,250
if this is your first time talking we

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,660
come and and get people to help you with

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,700
this because even if you're on stage and

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,110
things start to go wrong that's fabulous

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,240
that's what we're all there to learn

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,529
from we can all see what what's going on

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,839
with that and everyone is going to be

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,310
very very welcoming so there's not going

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,959
to be any one booing or hissing or

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,220
throwing things at you it's it's all

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,589
going to be people who really really

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,490
want you to succeed and with DevOps

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,740
failure is success I love that slogan

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,720
you have to keep that I think we might

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,550
not quite like that one now well you've

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,890
got the recording for it so just in any

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,380
last words for viewers who might be

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,420
thinking about and loops that they've

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,430
had or perhaps they might be thinking oh

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,370
maybe my talk would also apply to the

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,500
DevOps track then apply early of Kalai

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,120
orphan go along to the website and make

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,130

think of if you want some help with that
