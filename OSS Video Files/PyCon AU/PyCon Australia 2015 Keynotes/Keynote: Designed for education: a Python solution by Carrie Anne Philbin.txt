Title: Keynote: Designed for education: a Python solution by Carrie Anne Philbin
Publication date: 2015-08-02
Playlist: PyCon Australia 2015 Keynotes
Description: 
	The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages like Scratch.

The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost importance.

In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further support from the Python developer community.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. 

July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

	00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,450
today's keynote is an education pioneer

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,700
at the Raspberry Pi foundation chair of

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,430
the UK's computing at schools hash

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,560
include' initiative author of adventures

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,970
in Raspberry Pi and a member of the

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,150
board of directors for the Python

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,150
Software Foundation Oh Oh - carry on

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,910
apologies I was expecting to give an

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,440
hour's talk and I've got half an hour so

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,879
I'm gonna probably skip through some of

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,250
this and I might start speeding up and

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,570
talking really fast this probably won't

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,830
be a problem with you guys because we

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,000
speak the same language but when I did

00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,320
this at you're a Python there was a lot

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,739
of people leaning forward kind of going

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,809
what she's saying but anyway so this is

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,309
me my name is Carrie Anne that was a

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,790
really wonderful introduction I didn't

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,440
say any more because this is me but if I

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,390
was to sum myself up in one word if

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,339
someone came up to me and said what do

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,530
you describe yourself as I would say an

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,200
educator right whether that's educating

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,200
through a book through online tutorials

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,670
on Raspberry Pi - org or through you

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,950
know conference is I'm hoping to educate

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,560
you in this session today and that's

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,359
what I would call myself and and right

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,880
now I work for the Raspberry Pi

00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,409
foundation full-time and something that

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,090
always surprises me when I talk about

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,780
raspberry PI's people think we're a tech

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,159
company all the time I hear Python I had

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,259
about six conversations before my

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,329
keynote and every single one was kind of

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,700
expecting me to sell them this product

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,170
and actually we're a charity the

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,420
Raspberry Pi foundation is a charity

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,920
we're funded in a really unique way in

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,249
that we produce this single board

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,840
computer and the profits the very

00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:51,329
minimal amount of profits we get from

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,069
that feeds the charity so we're very

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,960
lucky in that we've sold over 5 million

00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,240
ralphie pyres so we're kind of doing all

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,520
right but our whole goal is not about

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,189
selling a product our goal and our aim

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,319
and our mission is to educate educate

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,090
children and adults particularly in the

00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,580
fields of computers and computer science

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,259
but we don't stop there we also believe

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,350
in related subjects things like science

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,030
art digital making you know I think

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,100
computer science underpins all these

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,200
subjects it's really important so

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,120
basically what I do in my day job is I

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,519
spend a lot of time thinking about how

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,950
children learn

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,569
and watching how children learn and not

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,980
just children but adults too like how do

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,050
they interact with the computer was

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,280
their first experience of Python and

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,060
really that's why I want to talk to you

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,890
about today I'm gonna say some things to

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,099
you as developers that you're gonna kind

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,780
of question and that's good but please

00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,629
bear with me I promise this comes from a

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,060
good place so this is me teaching this

00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:49,670
is proof I was once a teacher and here

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,920
you can see children looking up to me as

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,440
I impart wisdom to them by pointing at a

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,290
computer screen yeah that happened every

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,870
day I swear here's a more realistic

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,720
picture of in a classroom at the front

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,810
with some students um and so this was me

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,239
I left teaching in 2013 and I'm now on

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,190
the board of directors for the PSF like

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,470
how did that happen right that should be

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,970
like what well you know it's true and

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,160
that I think that's testament to what a

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,010
fantastic community the Python community

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,709
is that that's happened so there I was

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,920
just teaching having a good old time

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:27,049
with my students and then in about

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,090
2010-2011 two major things happened the

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,190
first one in the UK was the Eric Schmidt

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,290
from Google gave a speech in which he

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,700
said that the kind of intake that they

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,769
were getting at Google of engineers was

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,599
getting worse and worse and they were

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,609
struggling to find software developers

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,280
that they could employ and he kind of

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,290
put the blame directly on the education

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,079
system in the UK they said that what we

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,000
were teaching children in IT lessons was

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,790
how to be consumers of technology rather

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,819
than creators of technology and that was

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,109
a problem and he kind of also went on to

00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,940
say that really we were kind of like

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,130
selling children Microsoft products

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,859
really that's what we were doing and

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,799
then kind of shortly after that Michael

00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:09,290
Gove at the time was the UK secretary

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,609
for education he stood up and he he gave

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,840
a similar kind of speech in which he

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,160
said well actually what we're gonna do

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,019
is we're gonna scrap the National

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,169
Curriculum and we're gonna bring in a

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,000
new one so if you're not aware of what's

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,349
happened I know last year dr. James

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,240
Curran kind of spoke to you as a

00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,590
conference and I he kind of touched on

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,300
this at the end I think I believe he

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,380
said it was you know we had really

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,479
pushed the boat out and we were quite

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,729
scary but this is what our curriculum

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,039
kind of consists of this is a kind of

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:36,110
cut-down version for you guys from the

00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,660
age of five children will learn

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,370
to code and program and that means they

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,980
need to understand algorithms sequencing

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,840
selection and repetition I always make

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,760
this point this does not mean we are

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,040
teaching C or assembler to

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,560
five-year-olds okay this can be achieved

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,170
without ever going near a computer so

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,600
that's good news then from the age of 11

00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,460
children need to have least have an

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,770
understanding and have used at least two

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,600
programming languages one can be visual

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,910
so you may have heard of scratch that's

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,190
a very popular kind of learning platform

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,810
for learning computational thinking but

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,030
the second one has to be text-based

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,070
and this is where Python you know can

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,410
step in and really you know solve some

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,670
problems here and we're seeing in the UK

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,410
that a lot of teachers are picking up

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,240
Python and using it in the classroom and

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,100
they need to be able to solve

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,870
computational problems that's the whole

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,910
point of this curriculum it's not to

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,220
teach coding we keep hearing this word

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,690
in in in England all the time is coding

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,970
curriculum it's telling it's a bit of a

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,230
fad word that's not what it's about

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,620
it's about teaching children to be

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,720
creative problem solvers and so that's

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,060
kind of what we've got at the moment and

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,590
just to kind of give you some kind of

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,410
geography about where else in the world

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,810
this kind of stuff is happening so

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,730
obviously in England Estonia also have

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,970
introduced computer science into their

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,070
curriculum so they now teach it you guys

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,390
kind of so before I came to this

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,860
conference I met some Australian

00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,480
teachers in the States at a conference

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,580
and they were kind of pretty much like

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,560
yes we've got a curriculum coming you

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,150
know I saw the keynote last year from

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,950
James Curran it was kind of like this is

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,120
coming since I've been here I've been

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,590
talking to people and people like it's

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,260
not coming so I'm not sure if it is or

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,970
it isn't but my understanding is that

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,530
there that is in a process at the moment

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,260
it's somewhere it may be stuck somewhere

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,410
but it could potentially be here right

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,090
New Zealand is kind of similar in that

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,710
respect but one place that's really

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,150
interesting is Israel Israel have

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,820
included computer science in their

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,640
curriculum for the last 10 or 15 years

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,540
well like good for them right and when I

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,490
was doing some research on this

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,020
yesterday South Korea also in the

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,210
process of reviewing their curriculum

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,970
that's a really important point to make

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,650
here the first one is and this happened

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,570
after my keynote Euro Pythian lots of

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,860
people came up to me and said when is my

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,060
country going to have a new curriculum

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,620
like Germany or France or like

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,510
just to let you know I do not have a

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,600
direct line to all the governments

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,180
around the globe so I cannot answer that

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,830
question like I wish I did but I don't I

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,389
kind of like this idea of like the

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,389
bat-signal but it's like a Raspberry Pi

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,090
logo and they might just appear that

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,490
hasn't happened yet and then the other

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,770
important point to make is like you guys

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,690
you have territories right so in the UK

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,340
we're made up of a bunch of countries

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,560
are the devolved nations so this

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,270
curriculum only applies to England it

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,590
does not apply to Scotland it does not

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,690
apply to Wales it does not apply to

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,979
Northern Ireland Scotland are currently

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,260
reviewing their curriculum and we're

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,300
expecting them quite likely to push

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,950
towards and having a new national

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,120
curriculum that includes computer

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:34,830
science so I think in Northern Europe I

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,450
think Denmark and Norway are quite close

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,220
I went to speak some last year and they

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,810
seem likely so I think this will

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,639
snowball right I think once we've got a

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,260
few nations that are doing this I think

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,360
the rest of the world will snowball into

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,310
doing it you might think what why why

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,280
should we be teaching computer science

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,660
to children what's the point well these

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,370
are the reasons that I think first of

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,750
all the children are creative they're

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,870
imaginative they're not afraid of

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,690
failure something that we do as adults

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,060
is we train children out of this mindset

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,440
right so they're really inquisitive

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,030
they'll press all the buttons they'll

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,800
click all the things and actually we

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,350
teach them that's wrong and so well it

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,610
by the time got to me at age 11 in my

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,080
classroom I would find that they would

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,700
sit a complete computer with like a

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,350
dialog box opened in front of them with

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,030
their hand up and they would sit there

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,139
quite happily for like 20 minutes not

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,030
doing anything because they've been

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,889
trained and told in their primary

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,539
education don't click the box you might

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,979
break something and that's completely

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,630
wrong right it's the wrong way around

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,830
they should click all the boxes they

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,139
should break all the things that's

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,690
helped me there

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,899
I also think that computer science is a

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,940
vehicle for social mobility there's some

00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,890
really crazy statistics about kids who

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,539
want to be professional footballers but

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,640
like the top one percent in the school

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,200
won't make it the top one percent in

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,450
like a borough won't make it the top 1%

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,430
you know you know County and you can go

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,589
upwards will not make it's professional

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,810
footballers and yet computer science I

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,880
mean you know the jobs industry at the

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,079
moment it's just desperate for good

00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,450
developers and they'll earn a good wage

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,040
so actually a subject can move children

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,089
out of poverty and it's a really well

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,579
paid jobs that's interesting to me it's

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,649
empowering for no other reason than this

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,120
you know we don't expect every child who

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,620
will become a software developer just

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,449
because we've taught them some

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,040
computational thinking but hopefully

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,720
will empower them to be able to solve

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,779
everyday problems in a new and

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,430
interesting way I also am a strong

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,730
believer in diversity in technology

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,040
right now you know the people who create

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,079
technology don't represent the people

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,620
who using technology right especially

00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:36,350
when only like 16 percent of IT you know

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,329
specialists are women 16 percent in the

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,630
UK that's not really that great it's

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,070
similar around the world and yeah so I

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,050
think diversity is really important and

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,449
then the last one is this one and this

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,390
this is a reference to a video by a

00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:51,860
youtuber called cgp grey and i and he

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,079
talks about economy like he makes videos

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,839
like educational videos about economy

00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,880
and humanities and he made this video

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,440
called humans need not apply and I

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,329
recommend every vet work everyone goes

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,070
and watches it and it's this idea that

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,800
actually if you look around us

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,019
everything is becoming automated right

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,269
so I was a Melbourne Airport on my way

00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,100
here and I had said like self check-in

00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,040
on a machine it printed my boarding pass

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,600
and my my luggage label I had to take it

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,410
over to a machine like no one else was

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,550
doing it was on me through a computer

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,190
supermarkets when you checkout use that

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,620
self checkout right self-driving cars

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,290
all of this automation is going to put a

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,060
whole bunch of people out of work if we

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,769
just take self-driving cars as an

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,980
example just think about all the lorry

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:39,380
drivers or the bus drivers right if all

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,510
these people tomorrow become unemployed

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,410
that's a real problem for our economy

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,029
like worldwide

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,979
there's some crazy statistics he has in

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,660
that video about like actually

00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,309
unemployment only has to rise by a very

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,679
short small amount and it can be

00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,449
devastating and he's quite negative

00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,519
about this and but I feel that actually

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:59,519
if we empower our children and we teach

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,079
them computational thinking but they

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,239
could grow up to to work on these

00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,429
machines make them better write the

00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:08,629
software for them and fix machines when

00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:10,679
they go wrong and actually have a job

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,329
but really we're at the point now I'm

00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,709
kind of I don't need to make this

00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,749
argument anymore certainly not in

00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,009
England I think we passed this argument

00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,929
I think a lot of people agree that we

00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,970
should be teaching computing I imagine a

00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,349
lot of you quite you know you think the

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,239
same that we should be teaching this to

00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,759
our children so now we're focusing on

00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:28,859
how best should we teach this like

00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,869
what's the best way which brings us to

00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:33,029
why is pipe and the language that we

00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:35,220
should be using and to teach computer

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,169
science well for the first reason is

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,199
that it's used all over the world and

00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:42,839
it's used in real world situations right

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,479
it's a really good language that is used

00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,089
not just to teach and to learn but it's

00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:49,619
also used by like CERN and NASA and you

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,499
know Google and all these companies that

00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:54,059
use it and so you know it's powerful

00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:57,359
enough to be used in a like real

00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:00,239
development and of course it has this

00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:02,249
really simple syntax right and that's

00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:03,899
what makes it a really great language to

00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:05,309
use and we're finding that in education

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,129
so when I was growing up I had something

00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:10,529
called a BBC micro and so I learned a

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,549
programming language called basic and

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,959
one of the best things about that was

00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,759
you just typed to work print and then

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,039
hello world you know and then it would

00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,689
do something lots lots of other

00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,220
programming languages to get started

00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:22,529
like your hello world can be like six

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,839
lines long right weave curly braces and

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,609
you know colons and so on and that's

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,409
just not that's not helpful and it will

00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,939
put a lot of people but of course with

00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,189
Python we know it's really simple it's

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:36,059
one line and that's what makes it really

00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:37,409
exciting for educators to use and the

00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,169
last one which i think is the most

00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,939
important is that python has the most

00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:45,119
helpful community I've ever come across

00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,799
in my life you know how did I ever get

00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:51,689
to be on the board if it wasn't for this

00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,459
community and so we're finding that for

00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,610
teachers and for young people who want

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,740
to learn developers are kind of reaching

00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,660
and helping either through code clubs

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,209
like volunteering at coder dojos and

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,100
code clubs or by sitting with teachers

00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:07,310
at conferences and working with them or

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,660
just through online support so it's got

00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,810
the best community and this is what will

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,360
really help people so education at

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,310
conference is something we've been doing

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,779
in the UK for about four years now at

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,720
PyCon you case we always have an

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:24,290
education summit as part of as part of

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,690
that and so when I first went in 2012 I

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,399
want to say I was kind of invited along

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,310
when I was still teaching and I was

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,399
quite new to Python and they taught me

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,839
my first kind of programming skills in

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,500
Python they they taught me my first

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,329
program but also I found that there was

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,940
roughly about 10 teachers there at the

00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:45,200
time and mostly developers and by the

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,690
end of the first day I was pretty much

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,970
running the thing because I was one the

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,860
only teachers but we've seen that grow

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,209
now so this year we've opened it up

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,100
again for teachers we have our

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,050
conference in September we've got 40

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,690
teachers who are coming and one thing

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,029
that we do is we get sponsorship from

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,949
Bank of America who give us money so

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,930
we're able to release the teachers from

00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:08,589
school so they're able to come to the

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,850
conference and take part in training

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:13,130
this year at Euro Python we had our

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,690
first ever education summit which was a

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,089
great fun which I was involved in

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,610
helping with and that was the first one

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,920
here we had our first education mini

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,899
conference yesterday which was fantastic

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,160
organized by Nick who I think just you

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,180
know I don't think we've clapped you

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,180
enough today so I think

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,160
it's one of the best I've been to

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,080
actually because it was full of teachers

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,360
talking about what they do in their

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,010
practice so if you are here next year

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,330
and it goes on again next year I really

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,130
recommend as developers you go along

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,630
because you'll learn so much from the

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,740
teachers who'll talk about what the

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,240
challenges are for them in their

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,850
classroom or or what they've been doing

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,850
and you may be quite surprised by that

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,470
and also in PyCon Montreal they had an

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,990
education track as well which I wasn't

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,900
able to go to but I managed to present

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,580
via the wonders of Skype so I think

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,460
right now there's a whole bunch of

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,390
barriers for Python in education and so

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,950
what I want to do is kind of go through

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,960
some of these barriers and I want to

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,280
talk about some solutions that I think

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,430
I've got I'm going to need your help

00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,140
with so the first one is this idea of

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,810
transitioning from a visual programming

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,750
language to a text-based programming

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,670
language a lot of people find with

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,440
children that they love scratch write

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,580
they love using these click clicky

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,680
blocks that you put together and you

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,450
make stuff happen someone gave a talk

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,460
yesterday about how actually they saw

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:36,430
scratch it's actually causing them more

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,810
problems and it's doing good because you

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,850
know it doesn't really teach children

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,410
anything about syntax it's just clicking

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,760
some blocks together it does teach them

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,340
logic and it teach you some ideas about

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,540
algorithms and sequencing and so on but

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,830
moving them on to a text based

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,570
programming language can be quite

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,890
difficult because they love scratch and

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,720
it's a really comfortable place for

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,400
children to be and their first

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,060
interaction with Python can be quite

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,560
difficult so we're working at the moment

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,870
with the University of Cambridge to

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,550
develop a kind of a game based

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,340
environment where children have to write

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,570
Python text to solve problems in this

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,970
game that will move a little monkey

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,920
around it's called project Pyland and

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,330
that's kind of one solution but we're

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,120
not quite there yet we need to find a

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,560
way to move children on okay this thing

00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,120
about Python - Python 3

00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,930
oh my god this is the answer okay if

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,930
anyone wants to know

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,629
so I know some of you are not going to

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,759
like me like delving into this argument

00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,199
but for education just for education

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,120
there is no reason why we shouldn't be

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,129
teaching Python 3 to children right

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,529
actually this Python to Python 3 problem

00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,029
causes so many issues for children when

00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,500
they write something they've seen a

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,730
sheet Oriole online they've copied there

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,290
or that you know they've tried and they

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,819
bring it to me I'm stuck with it's not

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,410
working you're like oh that's in Python

00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,730
- you got Python - syntax so you've got

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,040
Python 3 syntax there you know it's not

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,600
going to work and it just confuses them

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,730
and there's no need right we were at a

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,259
point where dependent packages and so on

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,910
we're in Python 2 and that's where the

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,069
issue was but we're not there anymore

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,089
right we're just not and so I don't

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,220
think there's any reason why we

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,409
shouldn't be using Python 3 in education

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,539
the rise of the PI foundation we've made

00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:13,069
you know a decision that all of our

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,569
resources will be written in Python 3

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,159
and we strongly encourage other people

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,620
to write them so they are Python 3 as

00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:24,020
well and we're seeing that across other

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:29,600
organizations as well so the syntax

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:31,400
function naming problem okay so this is

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
where I get into grounds where something

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,360
you may get a little bit upset but bear

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,669
with me okay so children are very

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,039
interesting they're not only learning

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,900
about computer science and learning new

00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,130
programs and learning Python syntax but

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,320
they're also learning to read and write

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,820
right and we should be aware of that and

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,789
think about that and sometimes when we

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,620
write libraries we use kind of function

00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,419
names that make sense to us because

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,770
we're adults but what we need to be

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:58,580
aware of is sometimes that children are

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,020
using those libraries too so let me just

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,179
give you a bit of a back story about a

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,610
particular library that's called our PI

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,220
dock GPIO so on the Raspberry Pi we have

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,690
these pins which you are you can control

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,400
world world objects with and we use a

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,110
Python library to do that the guy who

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,990
wrote this Python library it's called

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,929
pen cosden in the UK he wrote the

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,940
library because he runs a brewery and he

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,559
wanted to control the temperature of his

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,200
brewery right so he made this library

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,880
for himself for this particular problem

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,070
but then what happened of course is the

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,140
entire are three PI community started

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,049
using it for all raspberry pi kind of

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,640
GPIO projects because it's great library

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,899
and of course you children using it was

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
showing children how to use it to turn

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:40,340
on and off any

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,649
they love it but the problem is it's not

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,230
great for beginners and it's not

00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:47,149
consistent right it uses a lot of

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:48,710
capital letters sometimes and it changes

00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:51,620
its mind and uses lowercase for other

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:55,149
other things and it's really not clear

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,499
so we need to try and avoid that problem

00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:59,570
one of the most common problems I find

00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,100
with beginner learners as well is quite

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,049
often if we're doing something with a

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,669
library that's called I don't know like

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,259
the PI camera library we have a camera

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,330
for the rods we play and there's a

00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:10,610
Python library library for that called

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,100
PI camera is that when people write

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,860
their first program they call it they

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,600
save it as play camera py which is the

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,080
same name as the library Ryan's here

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,450
you're like oh they're beginners they

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,990
don't know that right and it's a really

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,519
common problem a real common mistake

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,039
yeah lots of inconsistencies between

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,840
like camel case and snake case I

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,759
understand that there are kind of

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,409
conventions for this about classes and

00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,330
methods and so on but I would really

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,059
recommend that you try and stick to

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,619
snake case where possible just try and

00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,879
keep your libraries as consistent as

00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,529
possible because you don't know who's

00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,450
going to be using them and then

00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:50,629
guessable names I think this is really

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,070
important as well like we're children

00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:53,269
you wanted to solve problems you only

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,159
give them the answer all the time when

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,419
they're writing programs they might get

00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,240
to a point where they want to customize

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,619
it a little bit and they you want to get

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,019
into appointment they're almost guessing

00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:04,369
what that next bit could be as someone

00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:07,340
gave an example yesterday where they

00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:10,039
used like upper to turn some text into

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,389
uppercase and then the student asked the

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,590
student like or how do you think we

00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:16,399
could put this into lowercase and he was

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:19,519
like oh yeah that's right and what you

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:21,590
don't want is for the actual to go from

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,809
something that says like dot R / - like

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,639
- dot lowercase in capital letters

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:27,799
underscore you know something else right

00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:30,470
and I see this all the time in libraries

00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,110
all the time and so consistency is

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,039
really important you never know who's

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,289
gonna be using it so I'm gonna use

00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,659
another example which is on raspberry pi

00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,580
we have an API for Minecraft it's good

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:44,659
minecraft pi where children are able to

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,119
program the Minecraft world and so this

00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,940
this is just a very small program but

00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,919
I've written here to demonstrate and so

00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,509
it was written by I think an intern at

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,309
Mojang at the time it was just kind of

00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,599
like a little project someone did I

00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,249
think they were a Java programmer

00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,479
because like some of the things are in

00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:00,889
this library it was really inconsistent

00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:04,820
don't make any sense to me

00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:07,119
it might be why and so here you can see

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,200
first two lines are just setting up

00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,999
program connecting to the Minecraft

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,349
world actually a lot of children fall

00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,840
down in that first line just with the

00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:17,179
capital letter for Minecraft right we

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,769
understand what why that's needed and we

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,909
get that and actually it's not too bad

00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,409
because with children at least you can

00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:23,330
say well it's capital letter at start of

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,559
the word that's okay the problem comes

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,269
when their capital letter is in the

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,119
middle of the word like if you look at

00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,769
the last line it says set pause write to

00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,570
us we can guess that that's like set

00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,669
position of the player right we're

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,679
adults children and that means nothing

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,950
to them it really doesn't mean anything

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,820
to them it can be quite confusing so I

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,349
want to show you is so here's a line in

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,239
Python what I'm going to show you is

00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,129
something a friends has taken and

00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,899
they're doing an API but they're doing

00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:54,200
it in Ruby so just ignore this Ruby

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:55,549
right ignore that it's Ruby but just

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,349
look at the words that are using for

00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:01,129
naming their functions right so instead

00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,899
of having set pause right they've used

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:04,999
the word teleport because it's a nicer

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,590
word all lowercase and you can see here

00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,789
they've just use underscores because

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,320
this person has worked with a lot of

00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:11,239
children they see where they fall down I

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,309
think this word is nice though right

00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:14,389
teleport this person to these location

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,489
to these coordinates

00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:19,759
quite nice okay so here's another

00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:21,409
example in Minecraft you can like set

00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,759
the blocks and then if you know

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:24,409
minecraft you have different types of

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,590
blocks you have glass you can have dirt

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:34,369
you can have you can have melon that's

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:36,529
108 by the way TNT is 46 so on all these

00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:38,299
blocks have ID numbers and as you can

00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:41,570
see I kind of need to know those ID

00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:43,429
numbers in in Python or you can do

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,590
something like this where you put it

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,830
into a variable name and then call it

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,559
later on but I can be quite complicated

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,869
and a bit long-winded and so again from

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,639
the same guy so what he did he's just

00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:57,169
got rid of the numbers got rid of this

00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,910
really long you know having to put it

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:00,220
into a variable he just

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,740
in all of the names instead it's a glass

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,690
air so on so it's much easier to call it

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,280
so it's just thinking about who's going

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,230
to be using the library and what will

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,620
make sense to them and keeping it

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,750
consistent yeah so that's kind of the

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,720
naming problem and something I want to

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,460
quickly talk about is pygame zero this

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,750
is a really great library for children

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,870
to use so I don't know if any of you

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,610
know the PI game library it's a really

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,080
great library to get and children are

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,210
really interested in it right because

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,710
you wanted to take really visual with

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,940
children that's what that's why they

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,400
love scratch they want do something

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,720
visual but what educators find of Pi

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,000
great game is first of all it's a

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,950
library it's not no longer maintained so

00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,020
it's a bit out of date and it's not

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,420
really intuitive it's quite difficult to

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,530
get to grips with it's a lot of event

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,390
handling right you'd have to teach

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,180
children that first of all for them to

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,730
understand how to do things so at PyCon

00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,280
UK what we do is we have like a kids day

00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,510
we have a teachers day and what's really

00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,250
nice it's not like in a separate

00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,930
closed-off room we try and make it

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,270
inclusive and possible so developers

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,350
will see them they'll wander in and see

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,480
what the children are doing what the

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,880
teachers are doing and so there's this

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,370
fantastic developer called Daniel Pope

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,570
in London and he came along and he was

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,060
having a conversation with some teachers

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,710
about pygame and and he was saying how

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,210
it's such a great library and he just

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,130
use it and the teacher said well

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,540
actually it's really difficult and he

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,850
was like no it's not let me just quickly

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,170
this is like a real introduction like a

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,120
piece of code you could give them it was

00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,890
16 lines long that teacher said there's

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,370
no way I could use that and it's

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,710
important too

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,510
and so Dan went away and he thought

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,640
about it and he came up with pygame zero

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,680
so it's what he's done and it's only in

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,740
Python three is he's created this zero

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,170
boilerplate kind of framework for play

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,420
game which means teachers can teach

00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:48,450
things like sequence and conditionals

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,620
loops and use this fantastic library to

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,140
create something that's quite visual

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,880
without having to go into lots of detail

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,800
so there is some magic there but it's

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,410
not to magic right it's just a stepping

00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,910
stone to get somewhere so children can

00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:02,370
write just a few lines of code and make

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,080
some really meaningful progress okay so

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,670
my friend Sam Aaron he always uses this

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,870
example when he's talking is that

00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,370
sometimes you'll be working with

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,570
children and you'll say to him what you

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,280
want to do and they say well I want to

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,170
make a game you're like great okay we

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,730
can do that PI game yes we're going to

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:18,540
make a game what do you want your game

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:20,640
to be like well so I'm actually in space

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,290
and dont's to be some stars there's

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,640
gonna be some planets it's possibly

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,320
gonna be some aliens and there's going

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,840
to be some shooting and some firing and

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,110
like space bombs and so on and you'll go

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,210
whoa okay so in PI game I can make this

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,790
black square and the screen so we'll

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,620
call that space and I can draw this

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,930
little rectangle I guess that can be

00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,310
like a spaceship right and the child is

00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,220
like done because they've got Xbox

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,690
they've got you know they are

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,310
understanding what computer game is is

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,710
different to what I can do with them

00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,970
with playing game libraries so it's

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,010
about how can we make meaningful

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,500
progress with that child very quickly

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,970
and easily and not lose that creativity

00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,920
in that imagination that children have

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,750
and so this is where the pine game zero

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,870
library works really well we're even

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,580
putting it into raspbian package for

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,470
Raspberry Pi so that children can access

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,690
it so I do recommend you go and have a

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,310
look and contribute to his project and

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,830
we had sprints running on it at Euro

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:16,110
Python so we're still working on it and

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,850
hacking on it and Dan is a really great

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,870
community member and he loves lots of

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,590
support so do go and have a look so so

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,630
that's kind of where we are with

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:29,550
libraries um so I think sometimes we

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,380
find that people need to install extra

00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,540
libraries right fight that's quite good

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,130
it comes with a whole bunch of standard

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,030
libraries which is really helpful it's

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,950
one of the reasons why it's so popular

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,920
in education but it doesn't come with

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,240
everything and so

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,380
dan and I were talking on the first

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,810
night of Europe - we were talking about

00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:50,440
this idea of an education bundle so that

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:52,090
teachers can just download - right and

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,290
it will include a text editor and it

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,480
will include all the libraries that they

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,180
need things like pinecone zero but also

00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,890
other libraries things like numpy -

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,920
imaging library stuff that's like extra

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,700
but it said just included in this bundle

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,200
and so it doesn't matter what platform

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,090
they're on they're just they can just go

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,100
to this one place download this one

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,210
thing and it will help them get started

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,620
wherever they're kind of children

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,120
learning on their own or parents

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,100
learning with their children or they are

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,830
you know people working in schools it's

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,140
just one place you know it's really rare

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,700
to write a piece of Python code without

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,070
these dependent libraries these days so

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,000
let's try and get them into into a kind

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,890
of bundle and so I I mentioned this

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,120
arrow Python straight after we started

00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,040
talking to kelabra we talked about

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,900
perhaps using condor is a kind of way to

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,700
distribute that I don't care what the

00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,530
method is whether it's pip or it's

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,690
something else like as long as we find a

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,930
way to enable schools to be able to to

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,550
use this and so I'll come back to this

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,590
in a bit so I want to talk about what

00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,810
happened kind of after Europe - around

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,670
this area but the the kind of big thing

00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:56,500
for me that I really want to talk about

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,880
is about Python text editors right so

00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,680
one of the problems we have for children

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,280
when they move from from visual to

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,230
text-based

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,990
is their first interaction with Python

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,540
and with Python text editor is idle so

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,370
hands up how many of you use idle in

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,570
your everyday days you know day to day

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:17,120
development work one person

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,130
one person this is what children's first

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,630
experience of pipe not just children

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,520
adults as well learners this is their

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,470
first experience of Python his idle and

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,230
you guys don't even use it what does

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,760
that say okay and that's a problem

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,910
and so there are lots of solutions

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,700
around this there's kind of this idea of

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,080
offline versus online text editors I

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,670
think there are some fantastic online

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,830
text editors at the moment

00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,390
Python anyway is a really good example

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,820
of this and they're doing a lot of work

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,480
in the UK to try and help teachers

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,850
someone was talking about it yesterday

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,770
in the education track and this things

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,660
like shrink it Khan Academy have some

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,190
online stuff and you know you should all

00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,410
know grok learning right in here in

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,390
Australia it's a Australian product got

00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:00,170
learning is fantastic and it's Python

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,300
it's Python 3 but there is issues with

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,070
online like not all schools have access

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,080
to Internet all children have access to

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,330
the Internet and all of them have the

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,070
right browser enabled you know this is a

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,390
problem in my school I wouldn't be able

00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,550
to use any of these I was behind a

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,410
firewall I would have been able to use

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,600
them some of my children who are under

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,850
13 in the UK I wouldn't be able to sign

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,170
them up for these websites so we just

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,790
wouldn't be able to use them in school

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,490
it doesn't mean they're not really

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:28,430
really good but they wouldn't have

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,840
worked for me and it's not so easy to

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,280
kind of show progression of students

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,590
learning through using some of these as

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,650
well so that would be a problem so then

00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:38,660
we've got like on sorry offline IDs

00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,340
right everyone talks about pycharm

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,160
education Edition and why not right it's

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,760
great this is fantastic I'd either

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:50,120
developed it's free it's open source we

00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,250
love all of that but my argument is that

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,780
it's still too bulky if you open it up

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,120
there's too many windows there's too

00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,100
many buttons first thing you need to do

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,560
is help a project there's just so many

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,200
ways my children could fail yeah I've

00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,970
got a room of 30 children ok kids you

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,010
need to click on this now click on this

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,170
now press this then do this before we've

00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,910
ever written any code at all I want to

00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,620
do my lessons get straight down to the

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,430
computational thinking let's teach

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,510
something not let's learn an application

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,340
and I'm not saying it's not a good

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,590
product it is a fantastic product and I

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,600
definitely think it has a place I think

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,670
for children here are perhaps 14 15 plus

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
it makes sense who are working on

00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,610
projects and so

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,530
it makes sense to use a text editor like

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,929
that but kind of eight nine ten year

00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,940
olds this is kind of who I want to get

00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:36,740
at it's not really going to work for

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,270
them it's just too cluttered and it's

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,580
packed full of these wonderful features

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,919
and I would argue we don't want features

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,350
take the features away we just want

00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,960
something simple this is too many

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,539
opportunities for my children to fail

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,120
and actually sometimes less is more

00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:55,549
which brings me to idle

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,419
so you know over PyCharm I would use

00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,190
idle and that's a problem really so so

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,049
what's good about idle right so first of

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,929
all it's really lightweight and it's

00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:08,510
really simple right it's nice and simple

00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:11,179
it has syntax highlighting it does do

00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,470
some auto indentation I like it when you

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:13,760
open it up go straight into the

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,679
interpreter window you can start doing

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,720
things straight away and we heard I

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,250
heard this yesterday repeated by other

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,919
educators which was really exciting for

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,480
me and that's why we like it and of

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,380
course it comes bundled with Python so

00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,539
it's it's all there and so that's all

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,270
kind of what's good about it but it

00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:34,400
what's bad about it where to start it's

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,140
like two windows that's a problem going

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,820
between the two windows is a nightmare

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,860
as children fall down on that quite

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,500
often and get a bit lost why can't we

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,240
have it all bundled in one which is

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,909
really frustrating the error reporting

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,530
is just diabolical I mean we have no

00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:50,780
idea what it's trying to tell us is

00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,980
wrong with the code and that's a problem

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,559
for children because they get very

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,659
frustrated very quickly with idle so

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,830
what are some solutions and what I'm

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:00,169
going to do is I'm going to try and show

00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,500
you why I think of some good text

00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:06,559
editors but we can copy so the first one

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,510
is sonic pine so I works with a guy

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,799
called dr. Sam Aaron in Cambridge he

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,870
came to my classroom when I was teaching

00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,340
and he said I've got the Raspberry Pi to

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,440
make music do you think we could teach

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,570
with this and I said yes why not let's

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,280
give it a go and so we drew on a

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,520
whiteboard this really simple interface

00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:26,600
that we wanted to create so again I'm

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,580
showing you a ruby but forget it's Ruby

00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,799
right and what I'm going to try and do

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,980
is give you a sort of live demo yeah

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,040
okay

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,480
so this is the interface for sonic PI

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,919
you can see in this central

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,470
area here this is where we write the

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,030
text it's got line numbers this window

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,280
here is kind of like an output window so

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,600
you can see what it's doing and down the

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,669
bottom I have the all these workspaces

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,130
like and it's kind of switch between if

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:53,660
I want to play around with code and then

00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,049
later if this is it just makes sounds

00:32:53,660 --> 00:33:01,250
you just write like play 60 and it'll it

00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:03,590
should play sound switch it playing you

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,570
can see there was some output here and

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:10,429
the back can you see that text can you

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:16,130
see it oh don't worry because yeah I can

00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:17,690
make that bigger yeah see that right and

00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,130
that's that's just that function of

00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,630
being able to make text smaller and

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,130
bigger with a mouse click I can't tell

00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,770
you how valuable that is in teaching

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,210
right unbelievable and if you want it an

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,340
idol you've got to click on configure

00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,620
configure Idol then you have changed to

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,210
find the right font size and then and if

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,500
we're children especially when we were

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,370
doing our work on Mars replies they

00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,840
would come up to the front they've

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,120
plugged their pie into the projector

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,260
which is really simple but then we'd

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,270
have to mess around with the settings

00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,860
and show it so I just want a text editor

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,040
it allows me to make the text bigger and

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,780
smaller it can't be too much last for

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,770
and so we have like a run button we have

00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,169
a stop button this one does include like

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,840
an inbuilt like tutorial it's not really

00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:58,250
necessary but it's helpful what I love

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,190
about this one is because it's been made

00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:04,700
for music it also has a dark mode for

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:07,370
nightclubs that's pretty cool can't be a

00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,950
bit dark mode and then some other really

00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,750
cool things so again forget it's Ruby

00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,850
but don't forget it's Ruby because here

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,590
you know Ruby means you don't have to

00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,790
indent it this will just work and this

00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,470
is one of the reasons why it's used in

00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,550
education because indentation could be a

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,649
problem with children teaching them

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,179
about it and but what we find is they'll

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:25,129
write lines and lines and lines of code

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,080
and then they'll get bugs and they don't

00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:29,000
know why so we want them to learn about

00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,190
indentation so we have this a line

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,379
button which when I click it

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,510
automatically aligns the text with nice

00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:37,280
lines where we can see it sometimes the

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,379
four spaces in Python can be a bit

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,480
difficult for children so just a nice

00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,850
way of displaying the indentation I'm

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,750
not obviously saying it really

00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,970
indentation in Franklin it's very

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,850
important but there's nice ways we can

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,609
actually fix this so idle does have

00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,259
order Auto indentation

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:54,489
but what we find is you have to be in

00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,200
the right place to do that and often

00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:58,299
children will like sometimes you'll give

00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,589
them example code and so they'll go and

00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:01,299
write it somewhere else and they won't

00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,589
get the indentation quite right so

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,749
having a button that kind of moves it

00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,480
around or helps us some way deal with

00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:10,660
that would be really helpful and just to

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,960
kind of show error reporting I want to

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:18,069
show you this so what Sam has done here

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:21,489
if I just try and show you if I try and

00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:23,410
run this it will pop up and it will say

00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:24,759
you have made an error it will show you

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,980
the line that you've made an error on

00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:29,380
and it can distinguish between a runtime

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,049
error and a syntax error in nice big

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,210
bold lettering this is an error this is

00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:38,039
a problem and I think that's really nice

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:42,039
and just to prove that sonic Player is

00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:44,640
like a music platform tall this is the

00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,640
kind of music

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,900
so I'm being given the please shut up

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,250
warning so I'm gonna ten minutes okay

00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,440
right so I can quickly show you grok

00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,390
closing them so here's something that's

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,560
been more piping related right this is

00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,700
on the line can we get an offline

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,440
version of this because it would be

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,840
amazing so here you've got your panel to

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,140
write your code there's a kind of

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,960
instruction tutorial on this side but

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,980
what I love is that it also has the

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,600
interpreter window down the bomb and

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,760
it's completely interactive right I

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,310
could you know I could do like one five

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,050
that's five and it would give me an

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:23,730
answer I'm not typing for some reason

00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:26,280
you know it's completely interactive and

00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,830
it has these lovely buttons I say run it

00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,560
says terminal I can save my work simple

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:35,690
stripped-down not lots of confusing

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,690
features right that's really important

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,840
so um I gave this keynote at Euro Python

00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:51,090
I was a bit disturbed to find the guido

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,190
van rossum was in my keynote

00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,200
also very you know pleasantly surprised

00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,720
but also terrified because I made a joke

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,820
because two days before me he gave the

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,530
keynote and he asked members of the

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,520
audience to ask me questions and someone

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,130
got up and they asked him the question

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,250
what's your favorite text editor so just

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,960
to fool you fanboys and the the response

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,040
first of all was Emacs there was a big

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,350
round of applause and then a whole bunch

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,240
of booing and then he went oh but you

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,300
know sometimes I use vim whole load of

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,340
cheering whole load of Putin and but his

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,930
answer was and I don't surprisingly and

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,869
of course I made this joke in my keynote

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,070
I need to find him sat in the audience

00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:27,480
but we didn't really have time to

00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,770
connect straight afterwards because

00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,359
obviously he gets swamped with people

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,090
and lots of people asking me questions

00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:35,310
so being true geeks that we are we

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,750
started conversing via Twitter even

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:41,020
though we were in the same room

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,100
and so he he made this tweet he was kind

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,290
of like well I don't really waste your

00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,240
time trying to improve idle I actually

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,100
maybe the the best way we can do build

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,230
something better and what I was

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,690
disappointed to them find out like a

00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,180
couple of days ago is the whole bunch of

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,950
people have seen this tweet because I'm

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,240
mentioned in the tweet I'm getting all

00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,400
these responses for people who have

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,270
clearly not watched my keynote who keeps

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,530
saying why don't use PyCharm just go and

00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,330
watch the keynote and then you would

00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,650
know why the answer is not Python it

00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,390
also ended up on ready there's been a

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,430
whole massive conversation already about

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,260
this not one person mentions that this

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,300
comes from a keynote like who the hell I

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,950
am because if people just watch the

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,840
keynote they would understand what we're

00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,970
arguing for and then that just really

00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,860
frustrates me so you probably wanted

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,630
ring how and you can help of course you

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,080
are and the answer is not going on

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,010
reddit

00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,780
the answer is it's gonna be here so the

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,750
first way you can help right it's

00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,550
meeting educators come to the if there

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,020
is an education track at a conference go

00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,760
to it you will meet teachers and you'll

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,740
hear some really inspiring stuff and

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,450
they will blow you away like yesterday

00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,130
they were just amazing what they were

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,170
talking about and I was really I just

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,020
found it really enjoyable to be around

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,850
um add education track to your

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,580
conferences so one thing we're trying to

00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,080
do with my Python conferences try and

00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,170
ensure there's always an education track

00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,490
and we're getting there if you build it

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,510
the teachers will come the first time

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,010
you probably not going to get that many

00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,510
teachers like and say it was the same

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,190
for us in the UK but after a few years

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,400
that will grow and you'll get more and

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:11,980
more teachers yeah run special education

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,810
sessions at your local user groups so

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,970
the London Python dojo they meet quite

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,140
regularly and one night I kind of came

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,490
along and I brought the curriculum with

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,010
me and I said oh does any of you guys

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:23,050
want a hack on something around this and

00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,700
they made me some amazing projects that

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,310
I was able to take back to the classroom

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,900
I was just one teacher and so they went

00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,370
on to have like a special education

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,960
edition of that where they invited lots

00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,370
of teachers to come along so I would

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,020
recommend you do that if you have like a

00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,600
local user group or you get together

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,600
like invite some teachers you can help

00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,860
them in that way adopt a teacher so when

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,840
I went to the PyCon you came the first

00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,340
time I was learning Python you know my

00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,810
journey didn't end at that conference

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,280
afterwards I went away you know I would

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,540
practice know try and write some

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,950
programs and I would fall down and get

00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,869
stuck

00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,880
because I'd met some developers I just

00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,319
put my coatings paste bin just sent it

00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,549
to them and they would mark it for me

00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:58,380
and they would be like I see what you're

00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:59,490
trying to do there four out of ten for

00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,130
effort

00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,900
I mean that's really nice and I learned

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,690
a lot through that so that's how you can

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,369
help the doctor teacher help them and

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,650
continue to create and contribute to

00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:11,700
really great libraries there are some

00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,680
great libraries out there when you're

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,440
doing great things keep it up but for me

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,319
and this is the big one as part of the

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,960
PSF I've helped set up a Python

00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,369
education work group working group and

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,069
which is something we're moving towards

00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,599
on the PSF when I announced this at Euro

00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:29,099
Python it wasn't an official group

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,359
because we weren't sure about what the

00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,010
response would be the response was

00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,839
overwhelming and actually when I was on

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,970
a plane over here the PSF board had a

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,740
meeting pleased to announce that there

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,890
is now an official board they approved

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,359
it which means money is coming yes so

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,650
please join the mailing list

00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,849
I've set up a mailing list for this

00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,140
should be placed in there Greedo has

00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,000
already signed up for it

00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,910
so there's no reason why you can't and

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,740
the idea around this is we want to to

00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,109
actually do something about the problems

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,079
and the barriers that I've shown you so

00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:00,690
we want to make Python text editor write

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,369
as a community we want to do that so if

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,780
you join that group we're going to start

00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:06,270
having a discussion around that we're

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,099
gonna have money attached to this so

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,710
we're actually able to fund development

00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:13,740
if we need to or testing of it so please

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:16,079
join this mailing group and in no way

00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,059
replaces the education special interest

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,650
group that's another mailing list that's

00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,150
a fantastic mailing list and I also

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,130
recommend you're part of that that's

00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,829
more around discussion around education

00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,440
generally and this group is about making

00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:31,559
things happen I'm so if you're not aware

00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,170
about PSF membership if you're not a PSF

00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,480
member you can sign up from on

00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,470
python.org to be a member and as you can

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,690
see what I've done is I've highlighted

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,280
the membership level that if you just

00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,900
contribute five hours of you of your

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,369
time I think it's a month I'm looking at

00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,290
nink it's a five out he's not eating

00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:49,770
right so five hours a month of your time

00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,809
and you you become like a contributing

00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,980
member or managing member so if you join

00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,750
the working group and you contribute

00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,549
five hours of your time you have voting

00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,339
rights you have all this cool stuff as

00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:00,780
part of the PSF so you know please join

00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,010
my working group I guess it's what I'm

00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,109
gay

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,660
so being a good teacher I'm gonna set

00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:07,250
you some homework the first part of your

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,910
homework is obvious it's please join the

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,740
mailing list number two PyCon in

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,240
montreal at their education track which

00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:15,800
they didn't film so there's no video

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,910
evidence of this I wasn't there so I

00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,330
couldn't watch it everyone kept telling

00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:23,300
me this guy called Alice maggot he gave

00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,580
a talk about changing ID or like making

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,880
it better and so on github he has like a

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,200
wiki called idle reimagined and he's a

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,970
really good starting place there's no

00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,290
point to duplicate work right let's go

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,090
look at what he's done I've hadn't

00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,770
really read of it let's contribute to

00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,320
that let's see what the problems are and

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,150
how it can fix them and then the last

00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,490
one is this book this picture of a book

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,140
I have up here I think there might be a

00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,940
few copies lying around but we have we

00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,700
gave them two teachers yesterday it's a

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,350
free book my friend Nick Tala Vey

00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,270
in the UK he wrote this book about

00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,280
Python in education it's a free book

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,340
it's definitely worth a read to give you

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,190
some insight into this and your homework

00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,390
is due for PyCon Australia next year can

00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,830
you get your planners out and your

00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:08,270
journals once you writing that down

00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:11,090
I will check so let me finish with this

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,320
idea about the future so first of all

00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,660
there's this real danger at the moment

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,609
that coding becomes a kind of fad an

00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,650
education fact that we just do we do

00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:20,570
this hour of code once a year it's a fad

00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm teaching coding pat myself on the

00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,960
back because I sit my students in front

00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,970
of a computer screen and they do

00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,650
something let's make sure that doesn't

00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:31,550
happen computational thinking should be

00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,170
part of every child's education and I

00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,390
think there's a real danger that visual

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,369
programming like scratch could become it

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,320
and that's it children just learn

00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,609
scratch so we've stopped teaching them

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,470
PowerPoint and now we're just teaching

00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:44,359
them scratch scratch becomes the new

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,010
PowerPoint let's make sure that doesn't

00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:46,810
happen and Python can be the way we stop

00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,010
that from happening

00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,900
there is a danger that coding will be

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,670
limited to building apps I hear this all

00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,500
the time we're doing coding we're making

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,230
apps we're using javascript we're making

00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,970
apps apps app app that's right like as

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,680
if that's what we do is develop it it's

00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,260
ways if that's all there is to computer

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,850
science is making out we need to make

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,190
sure that doesn't happen too so let's

00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,830
consider the possibility that we're

00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,930
successful let's just think about in 20

00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,850
years time 25 30 years time these

00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,670
children right now who we're trying to

00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,560
help

00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,090
by teaching them these skills just

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,380
imagine what the world could be like

00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,730
when those children grow up they're not

00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,930
all going to become developers right

00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,820
some they were going to go into medicine

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,470
so I'm going go into the law some are

00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,150
going to become you're going to

00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,440
Parliament right there all these

00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,290
different areas that they're going to go

00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,630
into if they are able to solve problems

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:36,030
in a really creative way they have some

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,660
understanding about open source free

00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:42,750
software right what could the world be

00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:47,730
like it could be amazing it really could

00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:49,620
and I really believe that CSS via

00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,210
science it could be as fundamental as

00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,520
kind of like reading writing arithmetic

00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,870
you know we make this joke in England

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,910
like raspberry pie could be the fourth

00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:00,840
are that these children it would just

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,090
become everyday to them and I just think

00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,310
the workforce will be I think we have a

00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,320
real opportunity now and don't wait for

00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,540
a curriculum like make it happen now you

00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,710
can make it happen by volunteering by

00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,420
helping out in all the ways that I've

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,650
suggested and we can make this world a

00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,070
much better place and I really believe

00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,620
that

00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,320
so I'm Carrie Anne please come to speak

00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,850
to me about any of this I'm around today

00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,920
we've probably run out of time for

00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,220
questions because I do like to talk but

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,220
thank you

00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,790
