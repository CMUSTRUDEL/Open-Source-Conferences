	00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,630
right on to our opening keynote a

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,820
presenter today is an associative

00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,500
and I RC Australia research fellow in

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,990
the school of information technologies

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,880
at the University of Sydney he has had a

00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,380
profound impact on the use of Python as

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,180
a teaching language throughout Australia

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,310
as director of the national computer

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,290
science school has been responsible for

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,599
teaching Python to literally thousands

00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,430
of school tutors students and in doing

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,079
so has helped to create pathways into

00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,290
computer science careers for students

00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,700
diverse in gender and economic ability

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,500
today he will share details of an

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,760
important opportunity to bring Python

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,980
into Australian classrooms

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:55,630
please welcome dr. James Curran thank

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,130
you so I'm presenting here with a number

00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,450
of different hats on so I thought I

00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,360
would just start saying a little bit

00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,790
about each hat so in my regular day job

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,950
I work at Sydney University as a

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,259
researcher in computational linguistics

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,909
and I don't just teach Python but I

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:14,170
write Python hopefully a good day's a

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:16,630
day I get to write Python so that's one

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:25,240
dimension of where I come from on the

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:27,460
Python front second this is the problem

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,249
with these fancy slides going on all

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,679
over the place okay so the second hat is

00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:34,929
as the director of the national computer

00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:37,119
science school can I just have a show of

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:39,639
hands first of all who here programs in

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,909
Python good just checking I'm in the

00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:51,520
right conference secondly who learnt to

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:54,100
program Python at school and I see a few

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,289
NC SS students here in the audience -

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,929
can I just have your hands up - a few in

00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,069
CSS students come on image and I'm

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:01,659
looking right at you and you're not

00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:06,850
going to put your hand up come on

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,890
so so I've been running NC SS for quite

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,050
a while and I've got to talk a little

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,490
bit more about that in a minute

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,480
and the third hat I'm wearing today

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,230
which I'm going to say a little bit

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,060
about at the end is as one of the

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,340
founders of a company we've started to

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,950
get Python programming and programming

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,490
more generally into schools now the Hat

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,320
I haven't put on the slide is

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,750
I was also very heavily involved in

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,280
writing the new national curriculum so

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,650
let me just tell you a little bit about

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,640
these different things so the national

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,680
computer science school first of all

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,450
who's actually heard of NCS s even if

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,550
they haven't attended okay that's not

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:47,020
too bad but hopefully by the end of that

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:49,120
everyone put their hand up so NCS s is

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,980
the largest computer science outreach

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,730
program out of the University in

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:58,330
Australia in fact this year we're hoping

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,560
to cross the ten thousand barrier in

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,480
terms of the number of students

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,490
participating in our online programming

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,970
competition which would actually make us

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,890
one of the largest in the world in CSS

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,290
has almost been running for 20 years so

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,240
next January will be the 20th version of

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,240
NCS s under a bunch of different names

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,700
because of my involvement with schools

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,680
around Australia I was invited to be

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,450
involved in the Australian Curriculum

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,950
writing process and I'm going to tell

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,270
you mostly this is what I'm going to

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,830
talk about today is the new digital

00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:35,350
technologies curriculum and as I said

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,970
I've been writing Python and teaching

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,610
Python pretty much the whole time I've

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,800
been involved in in my university life

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,840
and I suppose finally the thing I really

00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,370
believe is that every Australian child

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
should learn Python so who thinks that's

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,860
a good idea

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,570
alright good I'd hate to have

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,890
accidentally turned up at the nodejs

00:03:52,570 --> 00:04:00,180
conference instead alright so let's look

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,950
at the current state of computing and

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,020
curriculum generally across Australia so

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,820
Australia has this funny situation up

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,030
until now where each state and territory

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,090
has had its own version of a curriculum

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,220
and therefore teaching programs

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,660
textbooks

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,270
resources everything needed to be

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,520
produced separately for each state and

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,780
territory now for a country the size of

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,480
ours that doesn't make a lot of sense

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,760
and if you're a child moving from one

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,360
state to the other it's not much fun

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,520
either so whatever you might not like

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,020
about the Gillard government one of the

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,100
things they did right was to say hey

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,950
this is crazy we need to have a national

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,960
curriculum and so the national

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,250
curriculum process started number of

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,230
years ago

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,760
first of all with math science English

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,560
and history you might have heard a bit

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,840
about it in the news primarily because

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,390
subjects like history and English are a

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,070
bit of a political football and right

00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,410
now Christopher Pyne is kicking that

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,180
football as far away as he can with a

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,360
review of the curriculum all talk about

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,150
that review in in a little while okay so

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,830
the good news is is that all of the

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,290
states agreed it made sense to have one

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,260
curriculum now agreed is kind of a loose

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:17,250
term and we'll come back to a little bit

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,900
of that craziness in a minute for me

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,240
what was surprising is that initially I

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,650
thought that IT computer science was not

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,440
actually going to get a Guernsey in the

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,710
national curriculum process at all but

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,360
we were actually included but to give

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,050
you a sense of how much government

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,070
really understands the importance of IT

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,260
unfortunately we were in the third phase

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:43,180
of subjects so we were down with PE with

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,340
all kinds of things yeah I know I mean

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,730
what programmers do like PE it's kind of

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,660
an awkward combination so we weren't up

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,220
in the top tier subjects and I initially

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,170
I think probably one of the main ways I

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,730
actually got into the curriculum writing

00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,620
process was that I managed to get an

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,840
article into the Australian complaining

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,370
about the fact that in the in the

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,130
allocation proposed by a Cara IT would

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,810
get 15 minutes a week in kindergarten

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,600
right now that grows a little bit by the

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,420
time you get to year 9 and 10 which is

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,460
where the curriculum ends but it's still

00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,320
nothing like what we would need and I've

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,390
been arguing for a lot of years that IT

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,550
is essentially the new mathematics and

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,440
it's as least as critical to be involved

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,470
in almost any empirical discipline that

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,940
you have the computer skills the IT

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,040
skills programming and you can see what

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,000
impact that had with 15 minutes in kindy

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,340
so for us this is an opportunity to also

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,060
have one programming language taught

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,220
right across the country as well and

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,780
having taught Python for 15 years and

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,480
and gone through a number of version

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,860
of Python I think that it really is an

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,139
ideal language to be teaching in schools

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,700
I'm not going to say too much about that

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,950
because that's not really just preaching

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,650
to the choir but also the orchestra the

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,080
conductor and everyone else in the music

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,270
process so but if someone wants to ask

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,160
me about that later on I'll happily talk

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,080
about why I think python is great for

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,430
teaching alright so just to give you a

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,200
little bit of an idea here are the

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,620
different learning areas in the National

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Curriculum and technologies is a

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,880
combination of the digital technology

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,040
subject which is the one we care about

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,850
and also design and Technology which is

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,230
the woodwork metalwork Industrial Arts

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:39,370
home economics all of those kind of

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,800
subjects so one thing that I should

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,260
point out is that the media arts

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,180
curriculum is where the federal

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,250
government has decided multimedia would

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,870
go so if you did computing at school

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,520
there's a fair chance it was actually a

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,900
combination of a multimedia subject and

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,310
well you know fingers crossed a bit of

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,200
programming and other things but acara

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,669
in its wisdom has actually split that

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,590
off and that's actually good for us

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,370
because I prefer the idea of having a

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:12,669
clear distinction between the subjects

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,740
now in addition to having the individual

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,000
subjects there are also these things in

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,880
the curriculum called general

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,280
capabilities and the general

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,770
capabilities are ideas that are skills

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,039
that are meant to go across all of the

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,630
different learning areas so in theory

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,930
you should actually be learning some of

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,510
the ICT skills as distinct from computer

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,419
science across all learning areas and to

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,669
give you a couple of examples of that

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,430
it's expected that your math teacher

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,860
will teach you about spreadsheets it's

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,990
expected that your science teacher will

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,010
teach you about databases probably not

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,140
SQL but but databases in some form or

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,110
other and it's expected that your

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,770
English teacher will go through using

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,770
Microsoft Word so this is both good news

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,800
and bad news the good news is that it's

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,400
no longer the IT subjects responsibility

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,140
to do those

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,450
things right and that is good to have

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,040
that clear distinction because I have to

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,840
say one thing I've noticed in my

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,330
professional life if you turn up at a

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,830
party and say I'm in IT then that could

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,590
be everything from a professor of

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,760
computer science down to someone on

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,890
helpdesk and no one really sees because

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,230
we have such a huge range of careers

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,760
really sees the whole range so I think

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,530
one of the great things about the new

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,900
curriculum is it actually gives us a

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:39,490
distinct area to talk about the hard and

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,870
cool stuff so the ICT capability is one

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,730
of those unfortunately we couldn't call

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,670
it IT literacy because apparently you

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,500
can't have literacy twice in the list

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,200
and since regular literacy has to be

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,260
there then you know we got a dumb name

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,210
so speaking of dumb names digital

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,510
technologies is not my preference for a

00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,010
name at all but when you're involved in

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,290
the writing process there's a huge

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,220
amount of horse trading and negotiating

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,560
that goes on and the name in the end was

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,120
kind of the least of our worries in

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,460
terms of discussing what would be in the

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,140
curriculum I hate the plural what's

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,560
ironic is I come from a department that

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,820
also has a plural information

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
technologies is equally bad as digital

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,720
technologies as a name one thing I would

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,460
acknowledge though is that most of the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,990
existing names we've had for our

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,990
discipline like computer science like IT

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,600
and so on don't actually resonate very

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,160
well with people especially with kids

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,730
deciding whether or not to do it with

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,800
parents and so on so I'm actually a fan

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,960
of Informatics as a name because I think

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,520
it covers the broadest idea of managing

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,260
information and the flow of information

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,370
and understanding the properties of

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:54,040
information but people weren't too keen

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,380
on that idea so the key thing about this

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,660
technology subject is it's actually

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,670
mandatory for everyone in Foundation

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,850
which is kindergarten through to the end

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,830
of year right and it's an elective

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,420
subject for students in year 9 and 10

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,700
which is typically the way it is across

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,250
Australia already and up to this point

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,560
there's no curriculum being written or

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:19,180
even being planned to be written for

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,259
year 11 and 12 now we know that there

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,089
will actually have to be

00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,429
huge changes in the year 11 and 12

00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,529
curriculum because the year 9 and 10

00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:28,479
curriculum now eats the year 11 and 12

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,229
curriculum for breakfast right across

00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,239
the country

00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:33,639
so it won't be possible for the states

00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:36,309
to actually continue with their existing

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,819
courses without a rewrite of those

00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:42,699
senior subjects but unfortunately

00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:45,279
there's no agreement to actually do that

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,019
centrally and of course it's no crazy to

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,789
be writing a joint curriculum up to year

00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:50,169
10 and then say fend for yourselves for

00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:53,429
the last two years of school so

00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,929
hopefully we can get that changed now

00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:59,350
for many states this is actually the

00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:01,660
first time that there has been any form

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,689
of formal IT curriculum apart from

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,809
general capabilities in the primary

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:09,579
schools and so this is a huge change and

00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,649
what we'll get to later on is actually

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,350
computer programming is going to start

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,809
in year three and that is going to freak

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,579
the hell out of pretty much every

00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:21,699
primary school teacher in the country

00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:23,499
and you know when I say there are

00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,769
opportunities for you to help this is

00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:31,600
kind of where I'm talking about all

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:34,629
right so this this is an a chorus of the

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,100
curriculum writing Authority infographic

00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:41,169
of how the different kind of ideas come

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,910
together so the the top level idea

00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:45,220
across the whole entire curriculum is

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,579
this idea of creating preferred futures

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,499
now I think that the particular phrasing

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,289
of this is terribly bureaucratic but I

00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:54,519
like the underlying idea that students

00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:57,519
should be given the skills that allow

00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,709
them to create a better future than

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,449
things are now and you know I've always

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,279
thought of programming myself is

00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:07,079
actually one of the key tools to be able

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,829
to do that within that then

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,230
unfortunately I think there's a bit of

00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:15,279
an overemphasis on project management at

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:19,179
school level and if you did yeah

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,069
and and if you did any computing

00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,889
subjects at school you probably spent

00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:25,329
far too much time on a project

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,819
management kind of stuff like

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,929
requirements analysis like all of the

00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:31,029
kinds of things that if you're doing

00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,619
some enormous project with a hundred

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,029
people and in a multi-million dollar

00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,859
budget would make

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,040
but if you're writing the thousands of

00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:42,970
version of blackjack that year in year

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,660
11 and 12 then you really don't need you

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,609
know a hundred page manual for the code

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,559
so there's a there's a bit too much

00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:52,059
project management to my mind but a lot

00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,410
of the teachers are actually very keen

00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,419
on this stuff because they think it's

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,679
important to learn early I think it's

00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,269
more important to get the underlying

00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,919
skills that don't actually think you can

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:01,419
understand project management until

00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,749
you've been on a project that's either

00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,399
failed or gone horrendously close so I

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:09,279
don't even think our undergrads really

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,290
get project manager so the key idea

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,839
really in the terminology that people

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,459
are using a lot these days

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,439
to describe the skills in this course

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,910
are computational thinking so I just

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,429
have a show of hands who's heard the

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,549
term computational thinking before yeah

00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:27,609
so you can think of it essentially as

00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:29,859
computational thinking is kind of a bit

00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:31,929
of a rebranding of computer science a

00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:34,629
rebranding of computer science just to

00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,639
make it have broader appeal to the rest

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,819
of the world that's not computer

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,350
scientists and and programmers I don't

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,109
really think it's any different to what

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,669
we've been doing for well since the

00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:50,199
1960s but but it's been set up in such a

00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:54,039
way that if you think of yourself as a

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,480
physicist or a mathematician or an

00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,069
economist or something like that the

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,410
computational thinking is something that

00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:00,970
you would be proud to have whereas being

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,569
a computer scientist as well as not

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:07,119
something you'd be proud to be so really

00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:08,919
the key idea is to frame problems so

00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,419
they're amenable to computation which is

00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,699
what computer scientists have been doing

00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:17,829
since the first time it's really about

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:21,639
having a mindset towards exploiting

00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,989
automation as much as possible and to me

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,559
I actually think this is one of the key

00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:28,899
things it's often described in terms of

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,069
laziness in programmers the positive

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,779
laziness you know it's actually

00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:33,609
difficult to explain the idea of

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,259
positive laziness to school kids and

00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,789
when you and when you've got a bunch of

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,309
teachers in the room at the same time

00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:40,959
they're like what the hell are you doing

00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:43,829
but but you get there in the end so the

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,570
idea that actually you're looking for

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,930
ways of simplifying

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,470
your work and and doing it faster using

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,180
your brain and I guess then some more

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,610
ideas to do with identifying the

00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,560
algorithms programming a solution and

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,020
understanding the limitations of the

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,000
systems you're building and so on and to

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,650
me I think one of the underlying ideas

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,280
of all of computer science is really

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:11,860
managing complexity so my take on

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,690
programming is it's actually the most

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:19,120
intellectually challenging thing that

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:21,930
humans do collectively people in quantum

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,000
mechanics might disagree but you know

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,470
and I think we're still only just

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,810
starting to understand how to manage

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,460
complexity we definitely don't build

00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,280
software on the level of reliability

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,280
that we build bridges for example and if

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,010
bridges blue screens of death from time

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,820
to time we would be much more unhappy

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,560
with them than we are with windows so so

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,290
these are the kind of core ideas of

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,130
computational thinking now when you're

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,720
writing a curriculum you have to think

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,060
of the time frame over which you're

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,030
writing this thing so we started the

00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,490
writing process two years ago and the

00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,580
shaping paper was written at least a

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,500
year before that so 2011 now it's highly

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,290
likely that this new curriculum won't

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,510
get into New South Wales into until 2018

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,970
right and then it will probably run in

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:19,720
New South Wales for up to 10 years

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:25,000
without modification how do you write an

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:27,850
IT curriculum that has to last for that

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,800
period of time right so let's say 16

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,780
years I mean that is essentially the

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,460
dawn of time in computer science pass

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,830
right the dinosaurs are running around

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,750
then so what we needed to think about is

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,490
what are some of the key underlying

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:46,140
ideas that will have been true since

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:49,180
before computation was actually possible

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,010
with a computer and will continue to be

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,810
true no matter what the computational

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,000
substrate looks like in the future so if

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,880
we're doing quantum computing or

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,620
whatever technology what are the

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,010
underlying ideas that will still be the

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,130
same

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,840
and I'd be happy to have you no

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,330
arguments with people later on about

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,480
what they think those things are it was

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,790
a great intellectual process to try and

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,070
work out what set of concepts you would

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,320
teach but here are the ones we came up

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:20,740
with I admit that the last one the last

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:25,169
two aren't really concepts as such I'm

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,760
really most happy with the first 7

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:30,850
yellow things on that list so I think

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,030
that you know the overarching idea of

00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,860
computer science and really the the main

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,010
thing about writing code is management

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,929
of complexity and abstraction and I

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,059
think that that's actually ours to own

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:45,669
as an intellectual concept and no other

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,320
discipline really teaches that in the

00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,140
way that we do maths might have some

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,000
claim to abstraction but actually doing

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,840
it on a practical day-to-day basis I

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,580
believe more this with us one of the

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,590
things you'll see here is that there's

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,419
actually quite a lot specifications

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,850
algorithms in implementation take a

00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:05,590
substantial time in the new curriculum

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,600
and that's one thing that has changed

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,210
enormously you'll notice that project

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,809
management is not a key concept

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,710
nor is specification yes what we're

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,390
going to talk a little bit about

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,020
defining problems but we're going to

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,270
think of it more in terms of thinking

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,610
exactly and trying to work out the core

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,710
parts of a problem not entirely in terms

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,690
of let's write a hundred pages of

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:34,690
requirements analysis in year eight so

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:36,460
the the other thing that actually is

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,429
going to be emphasized a lot in the new

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:44,770
curriculum is the idea of collecting and

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:46,960
manipulating data and surprisingly that

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,880
has only really got much emphasis in

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,520
terms of the productivity tools up until

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,620
now not actually taking data and

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,510
manipulating it programmatically to

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,520
solve some problem in another discipline

00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,710
you're interested in and there are huge

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,110
opportunities in the new curriculum not

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,990
just to improve computing but actually

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,960
improve every subject by having a bit of

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,870
a bit more of the digital technologies

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,520
in there with it and it's difficult to

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,779
actually exploit that in high school

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,940
because each subject is

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,469
essentially a silo that is fiercely

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,139
protected by the teachers in that

00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:21,669
particular faculty and timetabling often

00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:24,539
makes it difficult to actually have

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:26,529
across curriculum work but the new

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:30,489
Australian Curriculum actively

00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:32,139
encourages cross-curriculum study now

00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,700
and primary it actually is all about

00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:35,619
cross curricula in fact there are so

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,469
many things in the new curriculum if you

00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,489
are not teaching two or three areas

00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,679
simultaneously you're probably not

00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,080
actually going to fit everything in to

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,789
the new curriculum in the time you have

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,619
available all right so where is this

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,289
magical digital technologies curriculum

00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:56,320
well it is being made publicly available

00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:58,119
now on the Australian Curriculum website

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,950
and I've just got a bunch of snapshots

00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,639
of it here you'll be able to read more

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,679
in just a minute

00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:07,809
so the the one thing you can't see at

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,349
the top is it says available for use

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:13,389
awaiting endorsement now the digital

00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,190
technologies curriculum was essentially

00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:17,710
ready to go at the beginning of this

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:22,599
year but unfortunately a change of

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:24,190
government substantially interfered with

00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,809
the running of acara first of all

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,499
they've got chopped into pieces and all

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,820
of the non curriculum stuff was removed

00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,889
secondly Christopher Pyne decided that

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:38,139
every bit of education needed his loving

00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:40,989
touch and that included having a review

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:44,349
of the Australian Curriculum now the

00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:46,450
review is being conducted by two people

00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:49,539
that definitely have fairly conservative

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,769
views about education but I'm hopeful

00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,529
that they're actually going to that it's

00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:55,089
going to have very little impact on what

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,099
we have in the digital technology

00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:59,739
subject one of the probably the only

00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:03,009
good thing about neither major party

00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:05,649
knowing what to do with us as a

00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:07,659
discipline and an area of work is that

00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:09,999
we're not a political football either so

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:13,059
if you were involved in writing the

00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:15,159
history curriculum I can imagine that

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,659
your work may all just go down the

00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,839
toilet in a few months time when the

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,769
review is is released but I think that

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,629
we're going to go through fairly

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:26,349
unscathed the thing that's most likely

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:28,179
to change there there's an area of the

00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:31,330
curriculum called

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,830
the the cross-curriculum priorities and

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,600
there are three of these priorities so

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,370
one of them is sustainability clearly

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,039
something that coalition loves the

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,140
second one is Asia and our place in Asia

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,020
and the third one is indigenous

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,480
perspectives now every learning area is

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,490
meant to actually incorporate aspects of

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
those and obviously some can do more or

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,669
less for example we don't have a huge

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,520
amount to say about indigenous culture

00:22:54,669 --> 00:23:00,250
but we do have things like for example

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,230
sensitivity in collecting photos so

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,760
every learning area is expected to kind

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,860
of incorporate these things and what I

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,630
suspect is going to happen is that the

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,700
review will recommend that those

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,710
cross-curriculum priorities either get

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,750
replaced with the different three or get

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,000
thrown out entirely and that actually

00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,760
won't have a huge impact on us other

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,620
examples would be things like in the

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,650
curriculum students are expected to

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,500
learn about a multibyte character

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,299
encodings and Asian character sets and

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,460
Asian character input methods and so on

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:33,789
those things can stay regardless of

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,570
whether Chris Pine thinks they're a good

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,950
idea I'm not sure he knows what they are

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,720
so if you want to look at what digital

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,309
technologies actually is you need to

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,809
separate it from the technologies

00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,549
learning area which is to follow the

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,370
subjects link I've just highlighted down

00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,470
the bottom there and it can take and it

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,360
takes you right through to to the new

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,799
curriculum now there are a lot of

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,140
different ways you can view it this

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,480
version here shows you a summary of each

00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,100
year on its own then there's this column

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,340
view that shows you multiple years

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,620
together and then finally there's this

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,030
detailed view so the high level dot

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,640
points in the curriculum and what are

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,320
called content descriptors and then

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,970
within each of those content descriptors

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,250
there is a bunch of elaborations that

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,230
hopefully explains to a teacher what the

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,390
scope of that particular idea is and

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,740
what students would be expected to do so

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,809
I'm going to talk you through a bunch of

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,850
the content descriptors for the

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,010
different year levels but the way I

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,980
recommend you look at it is through none

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,539
of the fancy web views they're they're

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,919
great for navigating if you're a teacher

00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,419
but if you want to actually see an

00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,610
overview of the curriculum there's this

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,429
handy scope and sequence PDF on the

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,610
left-hand side here and we're actually

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:45,270
going to go through some elements of the

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:50,100
so each of the key concepts that I spoke

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,140
about before highlighted essentially in

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,970
a line across the curriculum so the

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,070
curriculum is broken up into bands so

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,290
kindergarten to year two year three four

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,900
year five six seven eight and then the

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,460
elective subject in nine and ten and as

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,650
I said unfortunately no eleven and

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,490
twelve yet but we can keep our fingers

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:11,400
crossed okay so the the first line

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:14,010
across is the digital systems line and

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,930
if you're in kindergarten to year two

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,100
you'll be expected to identify and use

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:21,450
digital systems for a purpose and the

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,220
for a purpose is actually quite

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,960
important because it's very easy just to

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,310
have kids in kidneys mess around with

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,990
stuff without actually having a

00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,000
particular goal but by the end of year

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,730
two they're expected to know which

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,830
particular device it makes sense you

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,390
know for example one thing you might

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,640
have seen if you've got young kids is

00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,980
people is them going up to a TV and

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,650
trying to swipe it all right because

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:47,930
every every device seems swipeable these

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,220
days so you know many years ago when we

00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,600
when I first started teaching computer

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,340
science at university we needed to

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,050
actually more like when I was a student

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,990
we need to actually tell some people

00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,640
what a mouse was right now we're kind of

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,710
the other end of the spectrum where our

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,570
kids think that everything that's a

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,270
screen should be swipeable impressible

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,310
and so on so working out what particular

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,250
devices do and how you can use them is

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,890
the start of that idea of understanding

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,920
digital systems by the time you get to

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,020
year 10 first of all an element of

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,900
security has come into these things are

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,900
securing in access to networked digital

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,540
systems and actually understanding the

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,750
relationship between software and

00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,300
hardware and operating systems and so on

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,190
all right so one of the ones that I'm

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,200
particularly keen on is the

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,790
representation of data I still think

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,740
it's one of the most amazing things in

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,630
computer science that everything in the

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,360
universe can be represented in terms of

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:49,080
ones and zeros and perhaps the biggest

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,970
downside of abstraction is it's very

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,060
easy to forget that when you're 75

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,270
layers above bits that actually

00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,710
everything we're doing is

00:26:55,270 --> 00:27:01,630
one and a zero and I don't expect every

00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,520
child in Australia to love that idea but

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,220
I expect every child in Australia to at

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,220
least be introduced to that idea so in

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,080
the year 3/4 banned students will be

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,590
expected to recognize different types of

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,030
data and how and explore how the same

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,750
data can be represented in different

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,240
ways

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,100
now this content descriptor and this

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,050
line actually connects quite well with

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,450
mathematics because the modern maths

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,700
curriculum or the Australian maths

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,960
curriculum now actually has quite a lot

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,180
of statistics and quite a lot of

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,900
analysis in it and there's obviously an

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,350
overlap between these two by five and

00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,270
six

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,190
they'll be expected to investigate how

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,290
digital systems use whole numbers as a

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,900
basis for representing all types of data

00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:46,630
now I sweated blood to try and get the

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,510
word binary in here and didn't quite

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:53,980
succeed in the five and six band but we

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:55,720
did get at least to the point where kids

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,380
need to understand that everything is a

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,910
number inside the computer and and there

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,240
is an elaboration that talks about

00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:06,220
binary and by the time you get to year

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,200
seven and eight they'll be expected to

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,780
investigate how digital systems

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:17,050
represent text image and audio data in

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:18,940
binary and that alone I expect in 20

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:22,780
years time will save me a substantial

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:27,210
amount of time so as as as someone that

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:31,120
interacts regularly with sponsors and

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:33,220
needing both well typically needing a

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,260
scalable version of their logo and

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,470
explaining to someone that converting

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,910
their PNG file to encapsulated pro

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,690
script and sending it to me

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,520
doesn't actually make the thing scalable

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:48,780
even just being able to do that in 20 my

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,780
future self will thank me

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,170
so okay so that's representation the

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,650
next is collecting managing and

00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,420
analyzing data and at the younger year

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,850
levels this is really just starting to

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,250
understand the idea of collecting and

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,960
presenting different types of data using

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:13,630
simple software and trying to solve

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,700
problems with it right and again there

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,390
isn't a huge amount of actually using IT

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,430
to do something in in the existing

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,410
curricula documents across the country

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,210
so we really got an emphasis on actually

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,490
solving problems and ideally solving

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,710
problems in other learning areas at the

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,260
same time so there's no reason why they

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,020
can't collect data for geography for

00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:38,380
science and for math to do the stats

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,640
stuff all of that should actually be

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,620
taught at once and it would be a lot

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,420
more fun

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,340
so by 7 and 8 they'll be expected to

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,710
analyze and visualize data using a range

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:52,330
of software and use structured data to

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:54,730
model objects or events so that is a

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,850
slightly less intimidating way of saying

00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:00,310
you're going to learn to use a database

00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:04,090
and ideally you're going to learn some

00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:06,100
SQL by the end of urate so now when I

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,840
say learning SQL by the end of you write

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,370
what we're talking about is the average

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,410
Australian student right though

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,150
obviously B students that will that will

00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,190
struggle with this but the goal is to

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,200
say well what do we expect a regular

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,180
student to do and the answer is to at

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,610
least have been exposed to some extent

00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,990
of representing structured data in a way

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,690
that it can be manipulated and

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:29,830
visualized and so on and we want them to

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:33,340
do that with a database all right so

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:35,620
moving on to the bits I care the most

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,390
about creating digital solutions by

00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,640
defining the particular problem

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,030
designing implementing then finally

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,980
evaluating the solution so in

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,600
kindergarten through to year two

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,430
students will be expected to follow

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,380
describe and represent a sequence of

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,870
steps and decisions needed to solve a

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:56,680
simple problem or solve simple problems

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,360
so a primary teacher in Candida you too

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,750
is not expected to use the word

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,090
algorithm necessarily with their kids

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,730
but I really believe it's entirely

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,500
right it's the concept of an algorithm

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,630
is something that actually every person

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,640
already knows but they just don't have

00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,650
the name for it and so to me this is

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,250
actually largely about creating the

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,840
vocabulary that teachers use to describe

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,530
things that kids already know how to do

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,480
so for example you ask a kid in year two

00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,030
how do you make a piece of toast right

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,530
they can describe that to you if you get

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,300
another kid to try and follow those

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,790
instructions and realize that they

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,230
forgot to open the bread bag before

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,450
trying to get the slice of bread out

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,700
you've got your first debugging all

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,350
right so it's actually quite accessible

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,080
to do this stuff without a computer

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:47,530
right as far down as as kindergarten to

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,050
year two and really getting that idea of

00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,870
how do I describe a problem and the

00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,130
solution to a problem exactly enough so

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,860
that a system that's not very

00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,530
intelligent can actually apply those

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,500
instructions is really the kernel of

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,910
what all programming is about by the

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,280
time they get to year six they'll be

00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,440
expected to design modify and follow

00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,930
simple algorithms in English and

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,340
diagrammatically and they basically have

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,950
to be able to handle the idea of

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,650
branching and an iteration by that point

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,920
and oops lost a bit on the end there so

00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,320
by year ten they'll be expected to do

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,240
that with more complicated structures

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,550
and algorithms and also validate that

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,870
the algorithms are correct now at this

00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,850
point we're just talking about

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:33,610
algorithms we're not talking about the

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,710
actual implementation themselves so when

00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:38,050
we get to implementing well here's where

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,300
it gets interesting so by the end of

00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,220
year three for the year three four bands

00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,590
students will be expected to implement

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,820
digital solutions with simple visual

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:50,710
programs using branching and user input

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,300
so by the end of year four we would

00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,880
expect a student to be able to use

00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,170
something like scratch or Alice or any

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,550
of those other visual drag-and-drop

00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:02,500
environments and I'm going to show you

00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:04,570
one of those in just a minute and be

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,270
able to do that with some interaction

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,400
and some user input by year seven and

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,040
eight they're expected to implement and

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,810
modify programs with user interfaces

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,580
branching iteration functions in a

00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,210
general-purpose programming language

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,570
what do you think that programming

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,340
language should be right exactly so I

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,980
couldn't get the word Python into the

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,419
curriculum you'll be surprised to hear

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,640
but when I was thinking about this I

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:30,890
thought can every Australian child learn

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,350
to program in Python by the end of year

00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,850
eight or at least be exposed to it the

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,850
answer is absolutely yes

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,159
and by year nine and ten implement

00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,020
modular programs choose algorithms and

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,940
data structures using object-oriented

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:49,659
programming language do you think I mean

00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:52,610
Java here right so I never mean Java

00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:57,130
except except if I'm saying why did I

00:33:52,610 --> 00:34:00,049
get a kernel panic then I mean Java so

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,809
so I believe that Python is the ideal

00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:04,669
language to teach the year seven through

00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:06,679
to year ten curriculum as one core

00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:09,619
language I actively encourage teachers

00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,750
to teach multiple languages and I think

00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,399
Java Script is a great combination these

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,159
days because kids want to do stuff with

00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,030
the web they want to do stuff that is

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,770
visual as well and and essentially I

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,440
think you're learning the entire stack

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,659
that you need to do web programming if

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,490
you get yourself Python and some

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,990
JavaScript so I'm not saying only one

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,820
language what I'm saying as a core

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,230
language we should be choosing one so

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,450
that we can share resources most

00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,109
effectively and I think that should be

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,629
Python

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:40,490
so finally collaborating and managing

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:42,349
well this all was planning and managing

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,750
stuff so I'm going to ignore that so the

00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,839
key idea is looking at the census data

00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,669
from last year that every one of our

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,220
three point six million students in

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:54,859
Australia will learn to code from year

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,690
three through to year eight as soon as

00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:00,050
the curriculum is implemented across the

00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,250
country and you know I think that that

00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,660
is really going to be amazing

00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:12,050
now who else is doing this at the moment

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:14,869
so there's Estonia there is Vietnam soon

00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:18,490
there will be the UK so the UK National

00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:20,900
Curriculum starts this September and

00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,460
they've got even more hard core they

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,500
don't actually have as many of the other

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,240
broader information systems stuff in

00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,100
their curriculum and I think that their

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,160
teachers are all going to

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,650
so so I actually think it's important to

00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,940
have a mix partly so that the teachers

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,980
are comfortable and also partly to

00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,220
recognize that the IT industry is wider

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,500
than just programmers as well and just

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,910
algorithms but the computer scientists

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,580
run amok in the UK when they were

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,850
creating the curriculum and I think that

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,880
it's it's even more hardcore so when are

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:55,160
we going to get this well so green means

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,650
almost straightaway so can you see where

00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,430
can you see where Green is so the a CT

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:04,730
is green actually to be a little bit

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,620
fair to Queensland and Victoria there's

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,870
a good chance because of this review

00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,730
that actually they'll also start

00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:14,120
teaching it almost exactly the same time

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:17,060
but formally it's not the case New South

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,860
Wales will probably be the last state to

00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,960
implement the curriculum except that

00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,880
I've heard recently that w.a is looking

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,710
to use the New South Wales syllabus when

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,190
it's rewritten and so they'll

00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,990
necessarily be slightly behind New South

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,210
Wales or at least in parallel with New

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:34,190
South Wales so what do I mean for

00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,110
different years well the acct

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,090
currently has the most permissive

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,680
curriculum in the country you open the

00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,960
document it essentially says teach

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,370
computing in New South Wales we're at

00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,930
the other end of the spectrum and we

00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:48,410
have by far the most tied down

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:50,570
curriculum in the country and and so

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,190
that means writing an even more detailed

00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,320
document and New South Wales Board of

00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:55,790
studies syllabus before teachers can

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,130
actually start implementing and that's

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:02,660
where the delay is so green hopefully

00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:06,080
means 2015 right red could mean 2017

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,450
optimistically or 2018 or potentially

00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,980
worse or it could be mangled right

00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,780
that's the other thing is may not even

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,540
come out looking like this this drone

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,820
curriculum so how can you help with all

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,310
of this well this is essentially a call

00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,260
to arms for all IT professionals and

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,440
actually everyone who's interested in

00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,060
computing within and outside schools so

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,250
a curriculum document itself doesn't

00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,200
solve anything right it's very easy to

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,780
go in schools and teach whatever or

00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,260
teach it badly from a textbook all it

00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:39,980
does is give teachers who are engaged an

00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:42,230
expert the space to teach this material

00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,090
so if you've got a great teacher then

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,250
that teachers life has just got a bit

00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,070
easier if you have a teacher who's

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,810
actually uncomfortable with IT then your

00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,300
situation hasn't necessarily changed

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,430
that much but the political will has

00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,530
changed enormous lis in that process and

00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,119
what principals are expecting of their

00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,250
teachers is going to change as part of

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,920
that process as well which is why it's

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:07,820
the right time to be heavily in to get

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,490
involved so essentially what this is

00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,130
about is that we need you we need you to

00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,890
go into your local schools if you've got

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,020
a child at school already then that's

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,790
usually the best place to go is to go

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,270
into their school and say hey I'd love

00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,970
to run a session and in my experience

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:28,430
teachers are actually very grateful for

00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,840
doing that in almost all situations the

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,760
only thing to be careful of is to make

00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,160
sure you're actually teaching material

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,960
that's age-appropriate and so on and

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,359
we've got ways to help you out with that

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,300
so what I'm going to very quickly do is

00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:43,609
talk about NCS s before I finish up and

00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,940
then give you a five-second demo of the

00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:49,160
current NCS s challenge system so I feel

00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,859
like the summer school and Python have

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,359
kind of been growing up almost together

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,700
so I've kind of interleaved Python

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,700
versions with the history of the summer

00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:01,280
school so bobbin bog camerfield and GDK

00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,710
who probably taught a number of people

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,810
here computer science at the University

00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:09,320
of Sydney started the summer school

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:11,119
sponsored by unisys in 1996 had a couple

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,780
of versions of Python we first started

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,170
using Python in the summer school in

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:21,590
January 1998 by doing just a little bit

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:23,780
of CGI scripting to make what was up to

00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:26,240
that point just writing web pages which

00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,940
in 1996 was very cool right most people

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,980
didn't have especially most kids didn't

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:36,140
have a modem at home that they could get

00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:38,090
on this thing the interwebs and so that

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:43,130
was really very exciting for a few years

00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:45,710
by the time we got to mm oops too far by

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,109
the time we got to 2000 Geocities was

00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,700
big enough that actually writing your

00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:52,890
own web page wasn't that exciting

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:55,590
anymore so for what

00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:58,880
is with our first new sponsor Compuware

00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:01,470
we switched to essentially a six-day

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,140
team-based cracking competition for

00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,730
classical cryptography and we had a

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,550
little bit of Python programming in the

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,740
lectures but not a huge amount the

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,720
downside was that everyone spent their

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,340
time writing ciphers and almost no time

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,950
learning Python so you take one simple

00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,870
cipher you modify it the smallest amount

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:22,470
you can and you resubmit until you spend

00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:23,610
the hell out of our marking server so we

00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,020
needed to come up with something that

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,740
was a little bit more sophisticated than

00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,140
that we switched over to Python 2 at

00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,960
that point and the major project for

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:37,170
close to a decade was building a search

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,480
engine and a website for a charity and

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,430
then it was a huge amount of Python and

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,810
in fact not only a lot of Python but

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,640
probably one of the first Python

00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,710
textbooks out there in fact every time I

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,990
look at a bad Python textbook now I kick

00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,210
myself for not publishing our notes

00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,010
about 10 years ago but there were just

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,610
too many other exciting things going on

00:40:53,010 --> 00:41:00,930
lots more Python releases along the way

00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:04,260
we became n CSS in 2005 we have a lot of

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,870
industry involvement so last year for

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,550
example we had over 60 industry mentors

00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,930
come along to various parts of the

00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,580
summer school it's now a 10 day

00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,700
residential camp for about a hundred

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,590
students and teachers around Australia

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,390
that year we also started the NCS s

00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,100
challenge our first programming

00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:24,120
competition and the goal of the

00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:26,250
programming comp was to encourage

00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,840
students and teachers right around

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,050
Australia rather than just the elite

00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,470
students to get into programming last

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:37,140
year we had over sorry two years ago we

00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,790
had over 4,000 participants in the

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,380
challenge which was great but it was

00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,790
getting to the scale where we could no

00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,590
longer manage it just within the

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,700
university

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,950
unfortunately the university didn't see

00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,570
it that way so the team decided that we

00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,970
would start a company to run the

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:53,460
challenge on behalf of the university

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,280
and on behalf of the NCS sponsors that

00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,480
companies called rock learning we would

00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,610
have liked to have just called it rock

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,970
but not enough people outside IT know

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:05,370
what grok is so he snuck learning on the

00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,630
end there last year we had over 7,000

00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,579
participants and

00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,960
switch to Python 3 for the first time

00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:13,589
and so now the summer school and the

00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,589
Challenger both in Python 3.3 the next

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:18,750
challenge starts on Monday and we're

00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:20,970
hoping to have over 10,000 students

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,650
participate in the challenge now if

00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,829
you're fired up about all of this and

00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:28,319
want to know how you can help right away

00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:31,410
one of the things you can do is help by

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,000
being a mentor on the forums within this

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:35,369
programming competition so it's a

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,960
five-week activity it's really it's not

00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:38,910
actually a competition it's really a

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,519
five-week learning activity pretending

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,289
to be a competition and at the moment we

00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,849
have around 50 undergrads who are

00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:47,369
helping out undergrads and some post

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,349
grads and some industry people in fact

00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,230
one Google employee that will remain

00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:54,329
nameless answered almost a thousand

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,250
posts last year I'm not sure they did

00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:58,319
anything for Google for that a five-week

00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,180
period but they helped us out a lot so

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,420
if you are keen to help out please mail

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,490
challenge at NCS seda you will come and

00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,970
talk to me afterwards and just to very

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:11,690
quickly show you what it's about

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:14,910
this is the current learning interface

00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,470
the grok learning interface every single

00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:20,460
example in this interface can be

00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:22,319
modified and run and the goal here is so

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,549
that students learn to experiment with

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,049
things and so I'm going to solve this

00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:31,529
first problem and the first problem I'm

00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:33,029
going to solve is hello world but I'm

00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:34,829
going to solve it like a student does

00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,240
I'm just going to put hello world in

00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:38,160
there without paying too much attention

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,259
to exactly what's required

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,609
now most Auto marking systems at this

00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:43,829
point we're just going out you've got it

00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:46,380
wrong game over what we do is we

00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:49,500
actually walk a student through solving

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,210
the problem piece at a time so here

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,369
we've tested that you've got the words

00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,720
correct which you have but we're telling

00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:57,750
you then that you've got the punctuation

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,369
wrong so now you know a really good

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,349
student at this point would go oh I need

00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:03,180
to do this exactly many students and

00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:05,160
their teachers at this point will go

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,130
okay I'll fix the punctuation not

00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,440
realizing that they also need to fix the

00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:12,559
capitalization the white space is right

00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,940
capitalization we've got to fix it up

00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:20,460
hello world and we've solved our first

00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,780
problem now at this point

00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,900
you don't need to clap me solving

00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:29,760
HelloWorld no you really don't

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:34,080
so yeah I did it I was worried it was

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,339
close the the thing about it is that

00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,650
it's not just about learning about

00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,390
programming it's learning to be exact

00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,310
and I think one of the things that

00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,560
distinguishes everyone in this room from

00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,420
people that are not programmers is the

00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,920
importance of being exact now some

00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,619
people think that's a personality flaw

00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,030
and have other words to describe that

00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,609
but either way for our field it's

00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,619
critically important and so we're trying

00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:57,570
to develop that mentality at the same

00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:59,130
time as teaching the programming the

00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,349
other thing that I will mention very

00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,910
quickly is this year for the first time

00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:05,280
as we're introducing a visual

00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:08,280
programming environment but with the key

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,349
difference that you actually see the

00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,450
Python that will be generated that

00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,869
corresponds to your visual program at

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:23,760
the same time so as I end livetype my

00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:25,530
hello world in here if you write

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,300
programs that are small enough to fit in

00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:32,040
this screen space I want to know about

00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,630
your employer so and with hurrah we've

00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,440
got hello world correct in two different

00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,339
environments oh really and another clap

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,810
alright so I'm going to leave it there

00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:42,089
if you're interested in being involved

00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,550
in the challenge please come and talk to

00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:46,170
me afterwards if we had a room full of

00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,390
people like this helping kids around

00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,550
Australia we would definitely be able to

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,109
scale ourselves to tens of thousands in

00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:55,640
the next couple of years and wouldn't

00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:55,640
that just be amazing thank you very much

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,470
you

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,180
