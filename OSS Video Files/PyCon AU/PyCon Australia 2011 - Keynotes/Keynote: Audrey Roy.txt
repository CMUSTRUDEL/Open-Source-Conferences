hi everyone welcome and I just hosted

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,200
the women in Python breakfast this

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,509
morning and and thank you to everyone

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,870
who came it was we took over the

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,080
restaurant it was pretty amazing and

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:21,779
welcome everyone to hike on I'm going to

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,510
talk today about diversity in Python and

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,849
how it is it's actually about untapped

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,679
resources and finding finding new

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,520
resources to tap a bit about me by day I

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,160
am a Python web developer I do python

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,790
and django consulting for cartwheel web

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,500
and rough seas and I i love python i

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,200
also like other things by night i'm an

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,140
open source advocate I'm best known as

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,190
the president of pie ladies or Python

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,579
ladies I'm a core dev of the open source

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,640
projects Django packages and a package

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,210
na Dori name to open comparison and I'm

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,299
also i also like to do art I do digital

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,229
art and sculpture I show at the hive

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,920
gallery and I'm the fiance of Daniel

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,850
Green felder hi Danny just as of two

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,850
weeks ago and

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:29,020
i I'm Matt Danny at PyCon 2010 United

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,500
States I attended on the diversity grant

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,970
and so diversity means a lot to me it's

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:41,050
the Python diversity has changed my life

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:44,740
so so first I'm going to talk about

00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:47,650
untapped resources why we need to why we

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,870
need to tap them once we once we find

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,360
the resources what do we do with them

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,310
what do we do with this bandwidth then

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm going to talk about recruiting and

00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:04,540
finally a bit about PI ladies that my

00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:08,950
grave and yeah Python ladies so so

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,950
Python diversity what is diversity so it

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:16,440
diversity means what what everyone

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:20,110
expects a variety of race age gender

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,410
sexual orientation disability religion

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,720
and geographic location and having all

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,170
these different types of ppl makes

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,470
Python amazing it goes beyond that

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,320
though you can think of diversity as as

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,030
just having Python Easter's who come

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,420
from different backgrounds so you have

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,760
you have the beginner coders you have

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,580
the students you have creative types

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,850
some people get into Python because they

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,970
are they come from computer graphics and

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,320
they they start with writing scripts and

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:58,209
and you also have writers photographers

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,989
the Python community also benefits from

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:05,130
having having activists with passion

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:07,750
about free software and Linux and then

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,049
people who come to Python from

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:15,190
scientific computing and and hardware

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:17,579
and finally the entrepreneurs are

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:23,769
another group of people who who write

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:27,190
web apps and and games another type of

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,700
diversity is is expertise what language

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,620
you come from and and most of us here

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:38,879
too aren't just Python only experts we

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,950
there's all sorts of experts in here and

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,959
you know just because you're a Python

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,250
grew doesn't mean you can't also be a

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:51,280
JavaScript guru so this this is the type

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,829
of diversity that makes Python amazing

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,329
that makes the community amazing so we I

00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:01,930
think we need it and so do we want

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:08,890
diversity well obviously I'm arguing for

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:11,769
it I I think that diversity um so so we

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,780
asked as a pipe as the community as the

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,489
Python community we need to be

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,609
innovative and if we want to be

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,709
innovative we have to have new ideas

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:24,039
constantly coming in from all sorts of

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:27,130
places and having those ideas push

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:30,400
ourselves to grow here I'm talking about

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:34,810
the entire ecosphere of Python packages

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,440
so not not just Python courts python is

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:44,919
is the whole community it's it's all the

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,530
all the packages on pi p um so sometimes

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,470
when you have too many ideas coming in

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,310
it it can be a bit overwhelming ends on

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,360
and you know it's do we really want

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,919
ideas new ideas coming in when we have

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,870
we barely have enough time to implement

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,699
all the things we want to do and you

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,639
would think you know most of us are are

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:11,500
pretty bright what do we really need

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:15,460
more people in the Python community but

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,240
it's not just about ideas innovation is

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,210
ten percent ideas and ninety percent

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,000
implementations so an implementation is

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,550
dependent on having bandwidth to to

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,680
implement the ideas that that you want

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,960
to create the opposite of innovation is

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,349
stability or leaving Python as is is

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,610
that the opposite it's I feel like when

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:45,130
I look on on github or bitbucket at at

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,529
projects and I see that a project hasn't

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,929
changed since 2009

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:53,259
I don't see that as stability I see that

00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:54,819
as a a project that is falling behind

00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,969
while the rest of the world moves

00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:01,689
forward so in order to grow we need to

00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:04,599
keep innovating so if we want to

00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:07,049
innovate let's tap our resources um here

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:10,779
are some easy places to start there

00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:14,619
fifty two percent of the world is women

00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:18,069
and and so that's that's over three

00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:20,259
billion people and I I can bet that out

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,689
of those three billion you've got you've

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:26,409
got three million of them who are super

00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:28,719
super smart people and why not get as

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:31,209
many of them as we can into Python that

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:36,189
was that those cream of the crop there's

00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:37,929
also there's also a lot of shy men who

00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,909
should be contributing more so it's not

00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:43,059
diversity is not just about women it's

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:46,559
it's about being open and and reaching

00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:49,899
out to everybody who can contribute

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:52,179
there are a lot of students who who are

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:55,959
looking for ideas for thesis projects

00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:58,839
and why not get them involved with the

00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,639
Python community why not why not get

00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,619
them hooked on open source and have

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,899
their their thesis project you know it

00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:08,499
might as well be be something useful

00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:11,919
that that um that can go beyond their

00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:15,849
thesis and finally there are a lot of

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,849
people at at non Python user groups like

00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:24,339
Linux user groups and JavaScript user

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:27,219
groups all who like Python a lot and why

00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:34,539
not tap their resources make the

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:37,329
community of retro so now suppose we we

00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:41,709
tap suppose we find untapped resources

00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:44,769
to tap what do we do next how do we get

00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:51,999
them contributing what what what do they

00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:56,379
do so since I'm up here talking why not

00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:58,419
start with with my own wish list um we

00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:01,029
we can start with with everyone else's

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,449
wishes but since I'm here can I go is to

00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,240
it

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:08,199
so in other words um what would I do if

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,289
I had a army of smart Python developers

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:14,289
who were who were excited to develop

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,749
anything that I could ever want and and

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:22,990
who have just had a limited bandwidth to

00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:24,969
give me so a disclaimer I I'm speaking

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,099
broadly across a lot of topics I've done

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:28,689
a lot of research but but I don't

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:33,639
necessarily have in-depth knowledge

00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:37,839
about about everything so first off on

00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:40,839
my list is image processing we have the

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,139
Python imaging library it is it is great

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,839
raise your hand if you if you use it or

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:53,130
if you've ever installed pill okay so

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:56,380
that's that's a lot of you um it's so um

00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:00,130
well it's great I think that I think

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:03,639
that we could do more and if if you look

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,220
so I have friends who work for on some

00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,160
of the entertainment companies in Los

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,380
Angeles doing doing graphics programming

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,310
ends and I asked them a bit about this

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,740
and what I found was that um was that a

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,190
lot of these companies build their own

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,610
in-house image processing libraries

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,709
because he'll doesn't do enough for them

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,829
or doesn't do exactly what they want and

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,199
I I feel like when you have when you

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:36,459
have a situation like that that is an

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:39,699
opportunity to to to develop other

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:44,529
things or two or to build a pond pale

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:47,800
and this is something I I had time to

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,839
work on unfortunately I don't have all

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,470
the time in the world and so this is

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,380
where untapped resources come in there

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,279
are a lot of a lot of university

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,170
students who who are looking for

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,389
interesting things to do who are who are

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,160
super interested in in computer graphics

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:11,410
computer vision and there's also a lot

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,930
of developers and photographers there's

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,160
a lot of overlap between the two and

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,129
finally

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,079
if you if you know of someone who who

00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:24,160
wants to get noticed by a big graphics

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:29,550
company go it encouraged them to to work

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:33,310
on some image processing work in Python

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:37,660
next up on my wish list is Python in the

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:43,980
browser so um why does it have to be

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:47,379
JavaScript um I I love python I

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,709
JavaScript I I like JavaScript i but i

00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,769
really love python i wish i could write

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:57,970
Python code to manipulate the Dom ins

00:10:53,769 --> 00:11:00,430
and just you know do everything and and

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,720
there was the sculpt project which was

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:06,490
on allowing you to write Python that

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,399
would get converted to JavaScript it was

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,439
an interesting idea it it lost momentum

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,519
but it's it's still out there it's a

00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:20,050
good starting point I I brought this up

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,380
to some Python friends of mine and and I

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,350
I was told you know why don't you just

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,110
go go look into coffeescript it's

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:37,060
pythonic it'll it'll do what you want

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:41,139
and so I looked into it and so okay so

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:43,899
here so so in jQuery you you look at the

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:46,149
so here's the document ready function on

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:49,870
this is an improvement over just plain

00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:53,290
JavaScript and next is the CoffeeScript

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,529
version of it where where where it's

00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,459
it's more pythonic you have you you have

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:03,009
the on the code block indented and you

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:07,000
have you have some white space after the

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:08,889
ready and um it's you know it's it's a I

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,470
could see why people recommended it to

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,899
me but there's there's these these

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:17,430
characters right there's like a dash and

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:21,550
a greater than sign then those are not

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:24,850
Python what what I want is is actual

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,380
Python using standard Python constructs

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,980
you know your your colon and your

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:35,040
just your eye i want i want python in

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,190
the browser scripts I i think if if

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,650
people could do coffee scripts other

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:46,260
people should be able to make my Python

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:50,010
in the browser scripts so yes we need an

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,680
active Python alternative and again this

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,200
is one of these things where where it

00:12:52,680 --> 00:13:00,210
takes time and it takes energy to do it

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,250
and we've got untapped resources we we

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,140
have there are so many students who are

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,230
looking for world-changing projects

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,780
there are also you also if you go to

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,600
hackathons or Sprint's there are people

00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,150
who are looking for ideas to work on so

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,090
there there are people it's just it's

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:22,800
just a matter of of mentoring and

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:26,670
connecting next up cross-platform Python

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,180
for mobile so um so this this sounds a

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:34,560
bit extreme right you you write Python

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:37,050
you have it you have it work on every

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,880
single mobile platform your iPhone your

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:44,490
Android etc and it just works and maybe

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,670
it it turns into whatever language you

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,670
need and it sounds it sounds crazy right

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,710
it sounds it sounds like a dream goal

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,620
that you can't really achieve but you

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,510
look at look at what JavaScript folks

00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,560
have done with phonegap the phonegap

00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:03,810
project is Java scripts that you can you

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:08,030
can write once and it works it works

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:12,600
across all mobile platforms and it's on

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:15,570
it gets turned into native code for for

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,180
each platform and it's it's a project

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,330
that came out of a hackathon so a bunch

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,960
of guys got together 11 weekends at a

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:29,070
hackathon dance and implemented this for

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,550
for Android and iPhone and they and

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,740
partly for blackberry ends and now

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,220
they've they've been tackling the other

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,089
platforms one by one why can't we do

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,089
this in Python

00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,510
games are another really interesting

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,340
area and and I think it's another area

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,530
that we need we ought to look at a bit

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:58,620
more the future is mobile and we need to

00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:02,580
catch up and I know that we are all very

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,010
busy and we we've got you know those of

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,190
us who are who are already involved with

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,350
open source projects can't possibly

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,810
start a new project and devote full

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,230
attention to it and and so the way to go

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,530
is to to recruit untapped resources to

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,570
the Python community and we can't just

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,610
recruit them in and tell them hey do

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,980
this we actually have to care we have to

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:30,530
find new people who would be interested

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:34,710
and mentor them and and encourage them

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:39,000
next up on the wish list is more Python

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:42,120
packages so before i go into this i want

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,190
to mention that there yesterday i

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,280
checked the python package index and

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:50,670
there are sixteen thousand plus python

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:57,170
packages so I I think that is amazing I

00:15:50,670 --> 00:16:01,830
think I think I think it's you know it's

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,190
just really mind-blowing and I I want to

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:07,050
push this a little further that I I

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,240
think that so I was thinking about how

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:15,180
many Python developers in the world's

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:17,690
there are and I I mean who knows right I

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,320
would guess that there are at least

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:24,510
50,000 Python developers who who have

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,400
who consider themselves intermediate to

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,940
advanced or who who consider themselves

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,830
capable of taking a snippet of their

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,520
code that might be reusable and putting

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:38,120
it out there to the world and if if all

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,820
these 50,000 folks could do that then

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:47,910
there would be 50,000 packages out there

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:50,610
and so my question is how can we get

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,560
every person in this room to release a

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,550
package on pipe you raise your hand if

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,610
you've if you

00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:02,010
released a package so keep it up let's

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:04,800
see okay so i don't know maybe about 20

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,439
to 30 of you so whoever is released a

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,839
package I I have these um Hershey's

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,740
kisses that I brought here from America

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:17,160
and um these these just came out there

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,319
the aerated milk chocolate kind and and

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:26,640
I'd like you to come up after ins and

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:30,090
scout one so so yeah if um and for the

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,420
rest of you I I suggest looking into

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:39,840
releasing a package just check out the

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:43,170
docks so to to go into this with it I I

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,160
have a friend in la super smart woman a

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:50,490
PhD in philosophy linguistics expert and

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,280
she came to one of the women's Python

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:56,580
workshops that that I've been to

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,309
organizing in LA and and the same month

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,460
she came she wrote she wrote functions

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,190
to help her analyze some of her writing

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,270
she's she's a very prolific writer and

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:12,270
she and so she wrote a syllable account

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:15,000
and a automated readability index

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,640
function and these are very useful you

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,580
would think and and how would the

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,059
question is how how does someone like

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,419
this who has written some reusable code

00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:31,020
take the next step and and put their

00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:33,750
work out there on PI P and I I feel like

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:37,080
if you can if you can write a function

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,690
you should be able you know you you save

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,830
the file you've you've got a module you

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:46,140
got a python module and um and the next

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,179
the next mental leap is if you have

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,760
written a python module you should just

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:55,380
be able to put it out there to release

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,510
it to the world and so um so the next

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,870
that leads into the next item on the

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,929
wish list just lower barrier of entry to

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:07,290
packaging I I feel like we're doing a

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,750
really great job that the already

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,440
but if you look at the Hitchhiker's

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,700
Guide to packaging it's it's really

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,060
comprehensive and there's there's a lot

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,850
of pages of detail in there I I guess um

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,880
I guess what the one thing it could use

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,280
is is a bit of a further explanation of

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,120
the leap between writing a module and

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:34,680
turning that into a pie v package and

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,680
and jacob kaplan mass of django has has

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,870
written some articles about

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,020
documentation and one of his main points

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,620
is is that when you have good

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,200
documentation it explains the same thing

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,110
numerous ways so you have you have your

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,510
tutorial you have you have a longer

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:59,010
in-depth walkthrough you have you have

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:02,390
reference talks and and so what else

00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:05,880
might help i would love a cheat sheet

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,900
about how how to package something

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,200
happens and not just for myself but to

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,200
be able to pass it out to everyone who's

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,620
here or everyone who's who's at the the

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,950
python user groups that i attend another

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:26,130
thing is maybe a web form that generates

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:29,220
your setup i file which you need for

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,010
your your python package and finally

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,990
maybe maybe some hands-on workshops to

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,280
help people get more of their work out

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:40,430
there so this is just the tip of the

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,680
iceberg there there are a lot of

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,540
possibilities that and if you're

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,540
interested in hearing more of what i

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:52,320
have to say i'm giving a talk next week

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,440
at kiwi pycon called python and the web

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,520
can we keep up and so be some

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,550
interesting bits a quick summary so far

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,590
we so we need to recruit diverse new

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,960
untapped resources to the Python

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,200
community and we need to lower the

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,230
barrier of entry to contribution so so

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,900
both in terms of helping them give them

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,030
ideas giving them ideas about what to

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,210
work on helping them get started and

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,870
also teaching them how to pass

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,590
gage and if if we can do this Python

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,590
will flourish

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:42,710
so now I'm going to go into recruiting

00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:45,769
so so here I've laid out a bunch of

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,899
wishes and the types of people who who

00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:50,840
would be good candidates for new

00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:58,159
contributors now how how do we take the

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:59,899
next step and recruit them so let's say

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,389
you're leading a Python open source

00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:04,909
project and you need more developers how

00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:10,249
do you go about getting getting new

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:12,590
contributors so um basically you you get

00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:14,809
people to show interest by showing

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,299
interest in them so you volunteer for as

00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:19,970
many Python events as you can things

00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,639
like this conference or or just your

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:26,360
local user groups and if there are no

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:28,639
events in your area you you start new

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,639
Python user groups and and meet new

00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:35,990
Python developers so it's pretty common

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:38,360
sense right the same technique works for

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,419
any specific type of developer for

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,299
example let's say let's say you're

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,759
working on a some sort of Python web

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,879
project and you and you need JavaScript

00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:52,610
experts you can't just wait for them to

00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:55,039
come to you you actually have to go out

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,960
to the JavaScript meetups and volunteer

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,970
to present and volunteer to help and

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,490
just make friends in the community and

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,710
get active in the end if there's if

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,679
there's nothing like this in your area

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,940
maybe maybe start some sort of Python

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,009
Java scripts event same thing works for

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,190
getting more women into your project

00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:19,279
it's it's a very common problem in open

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,700
source that um that a project will will

00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:25,100
have maybe maybe zero to two women and

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,519
and we'll need more contributors who are

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,970
women and you you can't really just

00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:34,340
expect them to come to you you have to

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,220
you have to do you have to go out of

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,700
your comfort zone a bit and and do some

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,039
volunteering and recruiting and I

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:47,299
suggest leading Python women's workshops

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,500
or or having your company host a Python

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,880
ladies dinner or

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:56,110
are just being active it's and um I

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,160
mentioned the IRC channel here because

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,070
because I know there's there's been a

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,690
lot of crossover and pilot impound pi

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,880
ladies with with various various core

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:13,270
developers of different open-source

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:16,190
projects and and it's as a result you've

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,740
these projects have gotten more women

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,410
participating in them I know some of the

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,450
some of the pyramid core devs have been

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:27,110
hanging out in pound pie ladies lately

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:30,950
and as a result the LA chapter of Pi

00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:35,210
ladies's is talking about hosting a the

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:40,360
pylons con / paramedic on for 2012 so

00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:44,000
something you'd never expect right so

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,860
recruiting in any contact so I'm talking

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,860
a lot about open source project

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:52,970
recruiting it's it's interchangeable

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:54,920
with company recruiting so on so think

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,990
of the best Python developers that you

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,090
know chances are they are they are

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,610
well-known open source developers and

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,860
think of the companies the Python

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,050
companies that that everyone dreams of

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:11,690
working for the best ones are the ones

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:15,440
who actively support open source a case

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:17,720
study is Mozilla they they lead they

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,220
lead women's Python workshops they they

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,410
developed the pi-star curriculum they

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,770
they've been actively participating

00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:31,670
sponsoring all sorts of Python advocacy

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:34,600
things and as a result they have top

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:39,110
developers flocking to work there

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,430
similarly you have cars com which is in

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:47,410
particular the the LA branch has been

00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:50,930
extremely extremely active in in in

00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,910
hosting and sponsoring Python women's

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,490
workshops and hackathons and not just

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:59,690
not just providing a venue but actively

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,870
having team members stay come in on a

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,160
Saturday and a

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:09,030
day and and and mentor and it's it's

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:13,110
been amazing and this is this is

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:15,780
something anyone can do so so if you if

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,000
your company has is not active and

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:21,480
advocacy yet this this is a great

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,790
opportunity just you know go out and

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,040
find ways to participate in Python

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:31,080
advocacy um so I know that the the

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:37,080
sponsors for this weekend's conference

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:41,970
are doing a great job I'd like to see

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:45,210
more companies being involved now I'm

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,670
going to talk about Python ladies or or

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:54,120
PI ladies the growing women's Python

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:56,370
movement so so PI ladies is along the

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,620
lines of all these other groups so

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,860
there's there's there's women's groups

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,830
for four different languages for content

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:09,090
management systems for four different

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:13,890
flavors of Linux for for web servers and

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:19,040
window managers and entrepreneur groups

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:23,250
a general developer groups on and it's

00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:26,610
you know it this this year is on the

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:29,670
year that we started Python ladies so so

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:35,190
it's it's about time that Python got it

00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:37,380
on on this movement and part of the

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,230
Python women's movement is just it

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,429
starts with turning smart ladies into

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:47,130
Python ladies so so running workshops to

00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,740
get more women involved with Python and

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,080
there are existing curriculums that you

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,720
can use that are fantastic there's

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,530
there's pi star and there's learn python

00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,590
the hard way both of them are free and

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:05,160
all it takes is is one instructor and a

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,840
venue to to host something and then and

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,309
then you can pass it off to other people

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,309
and it's it's just amazing

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:18,580
another part of this is is the fact that

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,770
not all Python ladies are beginners that

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,380
you have you know you there's been a lot

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:26,530
of focus on beginners but it's there

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:31,420
okay there are there are 35 women here

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:34,270
today and I'm I'm sure that that most of

00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:42,580
them are not beginners i mean i don't i

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:46,480
don't know but but i think that there's

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,760
just there's so many ways that that the

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,280
that women who are already involved with

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,640
python kit can take the next step and

00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,400
become leaders and um and in la we've

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,670
been we've been doing a lot of this

00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,610
mentoring helping helping women who are

00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:06,880
already intermediate or advanced Python

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,620
developers get more active in open

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,880
source get more active speaking at

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,950
conferences and and it's um we've been

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,880
getting together and helping each other

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:21,430
practice talks we we helped each other

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:27,220
just submit talk proposals in the first

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:29,830
place um so so let's let's help let's

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,800
help more women become leaders it's and

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:35,440
don't forget I'm while I'm speaking

00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,360
specifically about women this this is

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,670
applicable to any kind of

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:45,520
underrepresented group so things are

00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:47,950
getting better so I want everyone who

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,560
feels like a minority in here to to just

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:53,500
stay positive and and focus on the

00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,320
things that you can do and we have some

00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,100
amazing numbers for for pike on I

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,760
mentioned the on the 35 female attendees

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:07,770
and similar things are happening all

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:12,900
over the world so it's it's really great

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:15,970
so now do you need more convincing um

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,670
Python advocacy is actually a lot of fun

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:21,550
so I'm going to go into some photos just

00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:24,740
show you some of the real faces Fiat

00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:28,100
behind Python advocacy so

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:31,370
so this a lot of these photos are from

00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,350
are from the local group but you can you

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:36,800
know you can do this everywhere so

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:42,740
women's Python workshops on here we have

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:45,320
on just photos of on of several of the

00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,210
the co-organizers and mentors and then

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:54,440
photos of some of the the people

00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:56,690
attending all day Python project events

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,480
we're talking about so here's photos

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,590
from from the from sprints and

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,700
hackathons it's not just about sitting

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,990
and coding part of it is also about

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,200
bonding and making friendships and

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:16,490
finding people that that you can relate

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,800
to in the community and so so we've had

00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:24,610
Python ladies nights and social hours

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,610
and there was the breakfast this morning

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:33,410
so people who who are into diversity

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,750
bring new ideas and here's here's

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:42,559
Katherine talking about diversity of

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:44,809
Python web frameworks here's sandy

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,540
giving a talk on advanced testing

00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:54,350
techniques with with Django um here's

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:57,530
Jackie and Katie the who are presenting

00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:04,330
to the DC Python user group in an effort

00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:08,450
to start a DC pi ladies chapter and

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:11,150
finally this is a photo from one of our

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:15,290
sprints this is this is the future of

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:18,250
the Python community um just all sorts

00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:21,260
of people all sorts of backgrounds and

00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,220
just everyone having a lot of fun

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,220
writing Python

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,900
so in conclusion on come and find me if

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,150
you are interested in talking more about

00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,540
any of the ideas I I brought up today

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:41,670
whether it's teaching a workshop not

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,600
necessarily for women it can be for any

00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:48,750
type of workshop if you're interested in

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,130
forming a local pilot ease chapter or

00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:57,200
just any sort of women's group I'd love

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,970
to talk to you if you are interested in

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,490
getting more contributors to your open

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,820
source projects come find me and if you

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:08,929
just want to chat about Python come and

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,929
