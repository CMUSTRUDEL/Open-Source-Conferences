okay so as Richard said I the co-founder

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,430
of the ADA initiative which is a US

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,590
nonprofit able to increase the

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,199
participation of women in open source

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,230
and other open technology culture areas

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,650
and I'm also a PhD student at Macquarie

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,929
University trying to finish up that last

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,559
ten percent that takes so much time of

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,760
any major project I'm not really going

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,829
to be talking about either of those

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,230
things in today's code in today's

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,300
keynote perhaps a little bit University

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,170
we'll get to that what I am talking

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,430
about is changing the world with Python

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,360
so I know not everyone here of is

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,100
considers themselves an open-source

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,629
developer you don't really see code in

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,789
for the public and so forth but I'm one

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,930
of those people who started out learning

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,520
about open source culture and ideals

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,530
probably several years before I started

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,670
writing any kind of code that ever

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,409
worked and when you start out like that

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,780
this is kind of what you think open

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:18,060
source is like that yeah that you will

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,470
single-handedly save the world and we're

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,619
tight tops and and a stone expression

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,810
yeah so you think of it as a pretty

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,680
heroic endeavor sometimes that you're

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,869
making code that will be used outside of

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,680
people who can afford proprietary

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:41,220
software outside of people who have

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,290
resources to to get protein code

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,880
developed for them maybe you don't think

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,170
of yourself exactly like this guy I mean

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,640
there's alternatives you know you can

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,640
think of yourself as one of these people

00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:58,130
no I think of myself as but as wooden

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,130
spoon girl over there

00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,130
so that's sort of you know if you

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,130
depending on where you come in to open

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,950
source culture in particular people who

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,720
so I started reading about the hackers

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,190
dictionary and so forth in when I

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,040
started University at the end of the

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,830
1990s if you come across Jamie

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,120
zelinsky's writings too soon you think

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,170
open-source development is more like

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,970
this for people who don't know of Jamie

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,120
Zaretsky he was one of the original

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,780
Netscape developers and he was behind a

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,989
large part of the push to get what is

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,360
now firefox open sourced and then he

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,220
promptly left Netscape and bought a

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,540
nightclub which he runs to this day and

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,970
I think this is actually a photograph

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,590
from the DNA lounge anyway so that's

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,450
kind of you know where you might have

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,890
come to open source from thinking okay

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm going to be here oh and i'm going to

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,530
a party or not and i guess if you're

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,680
Anthony that might be true but for the

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,180
rest of us there's this disappointing

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,390
realization when suddenly realize you're

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:09,519
spending a lot of time more in this kind

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:11,780
of environment and then every so often

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,350
just take a second to adjust the mic

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,350
properly

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,080
we'll see how it goes this time if it

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,600
falls off again I'll use the lectern my

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,890
yes so you spending a lot of time

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,330
environments like this and every soften

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:44,240
you take take a weekend off and you

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:47,690
spend time doing this so what I'm

00:03:44,240 --> 00:04:02,330
talking about in maybe it is better to

00:03:47,690 --> 00:04:08,600
use the lake 10 Mike yeah okay switch

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:11,750
that off okay um right so I'm talking

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:17,989
about restoring your heroism with um

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:20,690
with a touch of Python so I'm going to

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,270
talk about four projects in the Python

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,250
space today for people who are in

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,280
Brianna's talk this is maybe a little

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,980
bit like that except for project instead

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,390
of one basically projects you might want

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,160
to consider contributing to or

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,960
investigating further if you want a

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,180
little bit more of the wooden spoon and

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,660
less of the Ku farm in your Python

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,550
development the first one I want to talk

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,070
about and probably devote the most time

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,750
to he's a project called plover probably

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:52,160
the least well-known of these projects

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:56,200
has anybody has anybody he actually

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,540
heard of the plotter project yeah okay

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,450
um yeah so that was about three people

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:07,190
for the benefit of the audio right so

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:09,350
for the rest of you a little bit of

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,260
background on this so what do you see

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,900
right at the top there is our standard

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,770
what's called steno keyboard layout so

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,930
steno is is the typing mechanism that

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,630
people use for extremely fast speech

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,210
transcripts like caught people who

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,610
transcribe court proceedings and people

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:33,260
who closed-captioned television live to

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:35,390
air the mechanism you use to type is

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,870
called coding you hold down multiple

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,730
keys at once each key press it depends

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,580
on the dictionary you use but each key

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,590
press corresponds to usually about a

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,310
syllable rather than a single letter

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,350
each combination key press that is you

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,729
can customize the dictionary so in court

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,850
reporting where there's a lot of jargon

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,680
and so forth you might have a single a

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,510
single chord that you've defined to be

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,770
as much as it as much as an entire

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:06,500
sentence it's arbitrary so traditionally

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,190
this is taught in quite expensive

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,160
technical courses steno typing and the

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,419
entry level machines to do it cost

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,600
something I believe something along the

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,250
lines of three thousand dollars but in

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,990
principle there's no reason why you

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,400
can't do it assuming that you have a

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,890
keyboard that can register enough

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,419
presses which luckily have been

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,650
developed a lot for gamers who have

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:33,560
similar kinds of styles so the cheapest

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,890
what the cheapest it's called the the

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,970
requirement is called an N key role over

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,729
sometimes called added ghosting i

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,970
believe the cheapest is the microsoft

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,350
sidewinder x4 which is about i think

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,020
i've seen it for under sixty dollars in

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:52,910
australia undoubtedly you know ten cents

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,760
in the united states may be so clever is

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,150
an attempt to bring steno typing to

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,950
standard keyboards so that is making

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,710
both the entry open source and making

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:10,060
making the equipment extremely cheap so

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:14,180
the reason this helps save the world is

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,479
that extremely fast typing is sore to

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,830
benefit for for a lot of us so to give

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,710
you an assets of what i mean by

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,330
extremely fast unless you do a lot of

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,979
dedicated sitting in front of your

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,320
computer for multiple hours over

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,720
multiple weeks most people I think

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,669
plateau who here knows their quality

00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,000
typing speed that's faster than 60 words

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,000
a minute

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:43,400
maybe 15 20 people anyone faster than

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:48,980
100 words a minute hey there's I see one

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:51,350
um so it's a little bit hard for the

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,360
steno people to tell because mostly it's

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,160
taught full time in technical colleges

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,530
you take a two-year course where you do

00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,870
nothing but do this and that brings your

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,420
typing speed up above 200 words a minute

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,410
I think the world records somebody who

00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,390
can type 350 words a minute but they're

00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,010
the estimate of the woman who founded

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,500
the plover project a woman called mirror

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,390
by night is that most people with the

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,910
kind of effort that a lot of us put into

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,310
learning quality which is you know a few

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,990
a few weeks to a few months with typing

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,230
exercises and not you know not

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,990
eight-hour days but you know an hour

00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,990
here and there over six months that most

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,280
people could reach 100 words a minute

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,900
that's around about the speed that most

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,880
people reach when they drop out of stem

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,620
courses because they realize there's a

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,870
big difference between a hundred words a

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,330
minute and the 220 you need to be a

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,979
certified court reporter but on the

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,540
other hand for the people in the room

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,150
who didn't raise their hand except for

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,580
that person up there 100 words a minute

00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,940
would be faster for your typing so

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,650
there's that but the the one more

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,040
changing the world aspect for that aside

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,840
from making typing faster is that for

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,460
people who rely on text for

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,650
communication so people who are entering

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,140
stuff in order to be able to speak who

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,750
who need to enter text in order to

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,180
produce text to speech output the faster

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,570
the better basically it's really really

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,240
hard to reach conversational speed I

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,890
think I think I'm pro I don't know what

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,560
I'm speaking right now it could be as

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:26,600
much of 300 words a minute so for

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,430
anybody who anybody who needs to take

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,320
down my speech which is court reporters

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,380
or anybody who would like to talk to me

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,120
by typing and having it read out fast

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,430
typing is

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,339
is a hell of a benefit so I'm just going

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,080
to have this is one of those moments

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,290
where I have a video and it could be a

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,290
problem

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,260
so this is Mira by night who is a

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,850
trained steno typist hum who has a

00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,530
typing speed of over two hundred and

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,870
twenty words a minute using so she's

00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,270
using she's using the plover tool and

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,920
she's using one of the microsoft

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,020
sidewinder keyboards here so she's not

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,420
using the very high-end hardware that

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:18,430
she would use professionally and she's

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:23,140
entered an online typing race okay so it

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:24,910
counts down and go every craft and every

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,870
investigation and likewise every action

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,730
and decision seems to aim at some good

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,160
hence the good has been well described

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,780
as that at which everything aims however

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,880
there is an apparent difference among

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,680
the ends aimed at for the end is

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,780
sometimes an activity sometimes a

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,670
product beyond the activity and when

00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,620
there is an end beyond the action the

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:52,690
product is by nature better than the

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:56,730
activity 213 words a minute so that's

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,730
denim and that's plumber

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,000
she has a number of YouTube videos five

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,040
or six demonstrating herself using

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,190
plopper and sometimes you can see her

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,230
hands on the keys and so forth okay so

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,460
the thing about plava is so first of all

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,430
most of you have never heard of it

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,870
second of all mirror by funded it out of

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,880
her own pocket she found a guy who

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,330
programs Python living downstairs from

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,520
her in New York and she paid her and she

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,700
paid him all the money she had because

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,230
she had this vision of open source denim

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,350
so they've gotten it to the point where

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,180
it works as an input mechanism on Ubuntu

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,430
you install this python program and you

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,610
get your microsoft sidewinder or other

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,640
in n key role of a keyboard and you can

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,589
do steno so there's some obvious holes

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,210
in that for starters not everyone uses

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:54,670
ubuntu there's also a great deal of

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,060
learning curve to go so me telling you

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,500
about this is very cool but I've known

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,510
this for a year and I haven't gone out

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,980
yet and lawned how to interstellar even

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,980
though I have a PhD thesis to write

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,330
so there's a hell of a lot of work left

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:14,170
to do and as far as I'm aware mirabai

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,580
has run out of funding so the kind of

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,060
stuff they need is well it needs to be

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,310
ported to more operating systems there

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,540
is a there is a competing tool already

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,060
for iPad but tablets in general and an

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,930
obvious next candidate because typing on

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,240
them is particularly horrible at the

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,050
moment you can edit the dictionary by

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,240
opening up so the dictionary of cords is

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,100
a giant text file in a particular format

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,340
and you can edit it in a text editor if

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,230
you want to what would be really nice is

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,090
some tools that make that slightly more

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,470
pleasant as in you know you don't open

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,960
it up scroll down to what you want to

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,200
put in your new cord put it in put in

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,960
the letters it translates to and then

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,490
have to test it to see if it conflicts

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,280
with other cords that have been entered

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,720
elsewhere in the dictionary because it's

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,920
a very good idea not to have ambiguity

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,450
so there's a whole bunch of tools that

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,150
need to be developed around editing the

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,310
dictionary mmm one thought I had was

00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,870
actually that they could they could

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,140
stand to have something that suggests

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:23,200
you appear to enter the sequence I guess

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,950
my research is convincingly argues that

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,560
a lot of times you could stand to make a

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:32,350
court for it so something that actually

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,180
our logs your keystrokes and recommends

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,830
that you turn certain commonly type

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,880
sequences into a cord would be a really

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,950
nice tool and finally in order to get

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,290
people over that hump of oh I have to

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,180
learn to type in a whole new way even

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,120
though I heard about it in this Python

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,460
keynote and it sounded kind of cool it

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,230
needs to have teaching tools it needs to

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,180
have at least you know the equivalent of

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,010
tux typist for Linux which is a standard

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,860
teaching tool and mirror by is sort of

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,020
hoping that something like frets on fire

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,880
will eventually eventually have a steno

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,700
version where you where you have to type

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,410
in order to get the music to play

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,010
so that's um that's one way you could

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,360
save the world with python by by

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,250
contributing to letting people type

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,190
faster and not just programmers but

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,810
people who people who use their

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,580
computers to talk and people who use

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,660
their computers and typing as their only

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,640
means of interpersonal communication

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,290
okay and that's the URL there's a

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,900
development mailing list already there's

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,910
a blog including some relatively

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,920
elementary at this stage introduction to

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,750
how to learn steno and how to read your

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,310
dictionary and that sort of thing I

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,690
think mirror by also spent a fair bit of

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,130
money on it at this point I guess is

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,960
that I guess it's a sort of a side note

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:53,180
I believe that the people who can do

00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,150
this at over 200 words a minute our

00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:00,200
often command seven-figure not

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:03,110
seven-figure six-figure salaries you can

00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,280
easily earn I think 150,000 us because

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,080
there's just not a lot of people who

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,320
spent three years in technical college

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,650
wanting to type it 240 words a minute so

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:17,320
that's where she got the money from okay

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,580
okay the software carpentry course I'll

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,380
do this at the beginning of everyone

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,900
who's heard of the software carpenter

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,160
carpentry again fairly small number of

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:29,230
people but more than more than problem

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,320
okay so this time you'd be saving the

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,670
world by helping scientists so there's a

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,470
little bit of that going on at this

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,170
Python in fact people talking about

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,970
scientific programming in Python that's

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,650
not quite what software carpentry is

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:47,740
doing so software carpentry is headed by

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,720
a guy called Greg Wilson in his latest

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,510
introduction to software carpentry he

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,150
says that he talked to scientists about

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,680
they estimate that they spend about

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,860
forty percent of their time this is non

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,780
computational scientists so people who

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,430
are doing massive data analysis and so

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,770
on it's been about forty percent of

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,260
their time working with computers to try

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,930
and get at their data somehow often

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,280
programming now and ninety-six percent

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,660
of them say that they loved and taught

00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,650
themselves everything they know about

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:23,110
software engineering or everything they

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:26,140
don't know why not write unit tests why

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:28,210
not use version control systems the

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,910
physicist answers what's a version

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,960
control system okay so to be fair you

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:36,870
can have these conversations with

00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:39,640
working software engineers as well and

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,170
as somebody who's who's a computer

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,060
scientist you can definitely have this

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,250
with computer scientists a lot computer

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,080
scientists are really bad largely not

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:52,720
all of them are very bad software

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:57,210
engineers so software software carpentry

00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:00,160
is basically a giant curriculum on the

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,510
they call it the ninety percent of

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,190
software engineering that gets you the

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,500
nineteen ninety percent of the way

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,010
they're essentially so it introduces

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,380
version control it introduces unit tests

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,150
it introduces useful languages including

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,199
Python but also simple spreadsheet

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,089
programming and so on to get people that

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,959
you know to get people working in

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,429
science you know using tools that have

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,199
been developed in the last forty years

00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,600
or so in terms of software engineer

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,720
rather than either reinventing them or

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,110
much more commonly simply not having

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,309
anything anything of the kind so you get

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,019
people who can't replicate their

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,730
experiment because they don't have the

00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:43,539
code or they don't have that version of

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,820
the code anymore you get people who

00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:47,980
can't replicate who can't work out why

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,600
their experiment doesn't work this week

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,950
because they can't revert to last week

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,299
and they don't have any unit test to

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,919
guarantee that their code works the same

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:58,860
as last week so saving the world we've

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,029
asked the software carpentry project

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,679
mostly involves contributing to their

00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:09,760
lessons which are distributed free open

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,440
online and our open source so you can

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,909
simply debug the lessons watch the

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,250
videos and work through the worksheets

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:18,340
and send Greg Wilson arrows whenever

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,840
whenever you discover a problem they

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,299
also are keen to have other people

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,399
produce lessons so they like them to be

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:27,700
three minute videos essentially you

00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:31,059
write a script you make a short video

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:35,860
they'll edit it for you cut it all

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:37,990
together put up a transcript and you can

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,350
give any variation of the course at well

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,909
it's aimed at University people

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,940
sometimes I the course is accessible to

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,649
undergrads most likely aimed at

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,850
introductory people who are in during

00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:54,159
grad school the full course I think

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,200
probably runs for is aimed at an entire

00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,820
semester they have a compressed one-week

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,519
version and a compressed three-day

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,700
version and so on and they're also keen

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,740
to have people offer to give that course

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,710
that's probably more accessible to

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,149
academics universities are in my

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,769
experience not overly friendly to people

00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,440
turning up and saying I'd like to give a

00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,309
course nicest that would be sometimes

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:22,029
anyway software carpentry they're

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:24,760
producing tools / Python

00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,649
community-associated tools for arm for

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,350
scientists to learn software engineering

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:35,799
um okay next tool okay calabar more of

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,260
you have heard of calabar yeah we get we

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,380
getting there I'm hoping this is a

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:46,730
linear increase

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:48,230
so calabar is a book manager it won't

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,450
literally help you save books from the

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,160
fire we will get to saving books in a

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,790
second i have i have a special for

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,950
richard there what caliber does is

00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,840
simply making managing your ebooks a bit

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,080
easier and get you a little bit more out

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,670
of the clutches of of individual ebook

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,940
vendors the core calabar for obvious

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,590
legal reasons does not actually break

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,630
digital rights management on your books

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,120
but it does allow you to centralize them

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,510
in one place it does the rather nice

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,530
thing of converting um epub format

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:26,900
ebooks to mobi and vice versa are mostly

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,600
in order to counter some of Kindles

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:36,250
evilness that it doesn't read the most

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,250
common format so contributing to Calabar

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,810
it's mostly straight out this is this is

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,900
you like to fix bugs involving strings

00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:48,050
basically if you if you're you're one of

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,090
those people who who has always always

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:52,010
dreamt like you wake up in the morning

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,040
to gosh I hope I come across a Unicode

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:58,780
bug today because I love those ones

00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,760
you should be contributing to caliber

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,350
they also I don't think they actually

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,420
actually call for this on their own

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,010
website I have to say but almost

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,470
everyone I know who's had something to

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,210
do with Calabasas they release soft they

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,130
release constantly they release every

00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,020
week they have more features for pulling

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,100
data out of some ebooks and stuffing it

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,770
into other ebooks and so forth what a

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,630
shame that some of the buttons like that

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,040
the selection of buttons across the top

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,420
actually Scrolls off the right hand of

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,250
your screen so if you've got a small

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,510
screen you can only use half the

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:35,000
functionality and things like that so if

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,040
you're interested also in GUI

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,560
development and user interface design

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,810
you could help save the world contribute

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:47,390
to Calabar okay that's the website

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:51,080
definitely worth using if you have doing

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:54,080
any ebook reading at all okay a very

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,400
brief non pythonic interlude rich is not

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,090
even a paying attention this has a

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,490
picture of a cat especially for him Yeah

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,350
right we have a picture of a cat to go

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,420
as for Richard as requested on Twitter

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,060
last night so a project it's not written

00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,240
in Python very quickly distributed

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:14,420
proofreaders people have heard of it a

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:18,320
little bit they they basically do

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:20,660
project gutenberg now they provide maybe

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,150
90 or 95 percent of books coming into

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,370
project gutenberg basically people scan

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,730
books they upload the scan to

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,900
distributor proofreaders heaps and heaps

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,720
of people go to the distributor

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,430
proofread oocyte so the knob are the

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,690
acronym there is project gutenberg

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:42,590
distributed proofreaders dotnet p g DP

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:44,840
not easy to remember people check the

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,030
people check the optical character

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,340
recognition I think they do five

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,080
separate passes now like so five

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,180
separate dedicated proofreaders have to

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,820
read every book at the end of that it

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,500
gets uploaded to project gutenberg I

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,120
stuck this in here because it is a

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,350
little bit more directly saving books

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,690
from the file where the fire is

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:08,120
copyright claims by people who have

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,770
released new additions

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,800
so Project Gutenberg distributes books

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,810
that were published before 1923 and by

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,330
far the easiest way to prove that is to

00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,520
get a copy that was printed before 1923

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,000
and those are slowly disappearing for

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,100
obvious reasons okay so if you literally

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,750
or more literally want to say books from

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,940
fire you could drop in to distribute and

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,440
proofread its own but the bar the code

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,200
that drives the site while it's open

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:40,580
source is written in PHP so that's why

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:45,090
the cat was angry okay last of all sugar

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,550
so people who have heard of sugar the

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,500
sugar the learning environment for

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:55,110
originally for the One Laptop Per child

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,730
project so right so this is helping

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,110
children which is obviously holding save

00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,940
the world I don't know whether I need to

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,680
develop that argument any further we

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,130
have a cute child on the screen ladies

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,130
and gentlemen

00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:17,979
Anthony would like to save the cat okay

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:20,809
Q children so sugar is a an innovative

00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:23,929
collaboration oriented learning

00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:27,970
environment for sort of children up to

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:33,139
primary school age it's very focused on

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:35,090
collaboratively editing documents it has

00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,159
the cute feature that you can access

00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:40,129
that while you're actually using your

00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,809
it's not only for OLPC now you can get

00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,989
our own USB stick and stick it in any

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:46,460
laptop that you can actually click on

00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:48,470
something and there's the source code

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,359
that's running on your laptop in Python

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,279
and you can actually edit sugar if

00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:54,019
you're a a small child and you have

00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,840
small enough fingers for those keyboards

00:24:54,019 --> 00:25:01,070
you can actually edit the edit the code

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,559
as you go so it's a pretty big project

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,090
is basically a window manager on up

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,979
through an incredible number of

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,139
applications which they call activities

00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:12,019
so it's got a wide range of stuff you

00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:14,119
can do for them they still have a lot of

00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:16,099
core environment development so if you

00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,139
just didn't hacking on window manager

00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,729
level display level kind of stuff

00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:22,460
there's a fair bit of that going on

00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:25,940
there's activities which is the writing

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:29,269
and chatting and web surfing and doing

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,590
maths collaboratively tools in

00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,460
particular they have a little project

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,220
called math for which is teaching

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,379
teaching grade four level mathematics

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,119
and they have infrastructure which is

00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:42,499
running their website and all that sort

00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,849
of thing it's a big enough project that

00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,710
they have a dedicated team of volunteers

00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:48,970
working on their website and working on

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,259
their presentation and so on okay and

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:56,779
that's where they are there at sugar

00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:58,249
labs okay and if you didn't and then at

00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,929
some point somebody will consider you

00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:01,340
cool enough to invite you to their

00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,470
special party at the open source

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,830
nightclub

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:10,110
alright so that brings me to the end of

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,419
my four projects you could contribute to

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,970
in Python in order to do your bit in

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,679
saving the world I just have some quick

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:20,490
things I wrote this on the Adria

00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:23,220
initiatives time so their sponsors are

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,220
listed there the the high-level sponsors

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:30,269
were Linux Australia puppet labs and the

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:33,889
dreamhost web hosting and last of all my

00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:37,710
husband Andrew Bennett's who dug up I

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:39,929
think two of these projects for me and

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:46,909
criticize my choice of images for the

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:46,909
for the talk hey all right

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,750
no okay okay um okay at the risk of

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,170
possibly turning this into a yak shaving

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,700
exercise you've mentioned for projects

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,650
here which would benefit from having

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,410
Python hackers join in and contribute

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:40,500
there are three hundred out of us here

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,060
and the 270 odd who aren't already

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,480
contributors to a large open source

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,560
project would possibly flood those four

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,900
if they all turned up tomorrow to

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,370
contribute there is obviously a lot of

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,770
open source contributors who aren't in

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,390
this room what's the best way to

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,740
coordinate effort here I mean is that

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,510
you said that your husband had to bring

00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,860
you two of these projects I'm sure there

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,560
are for everyone on there I've got a

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,540
thousand of people who would like help

00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,060
doing their thing they weren't picked on

00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,010
Python technical and want the assistance

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,430
how do we coordinate that effort better

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,050
yeah so I have to say I was a specious

00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,490
that not everyone in this room is

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,670
immediately going to join one of these

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,610
projects so I'm hope that I'm hoping

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:22,500
that I'm hoping that that will save so i

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,570
think just to give you an example so

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,190
sugar could probably absorb everyone in

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,450
this room if you all suddenly turn up

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,980
like it might be a little bit of our

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,720
theme for them and they could probably

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,170
absorbed not recommend that everyone

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,700
goes in volunteers for plovar because

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,820
they had 10 posts their mailing list

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,360
last month and 300 of them might scare

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,580
them a little bit um in terms of

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,440
recruiting people to projects it's I

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:51,420
have to say that's a really good

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:55,260
question um I don't know of any really

00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,230
good mechanism for two at the moment to

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,670
identify you know somebody turns out

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,510
they say I want to be an open-source

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:05,940
hacker what project should I join and

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,470
that is kind of the eternal mentor in

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,210
question in open source because it's

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,980
really hard to answer you want a project

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,660
I'm reasonably sure all of these

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,160
projects are living and actually accept

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,670
patches that's the first thing you need

00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,650
to check on that they all actually want

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,710
contributors who aren't the main author

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,990
is another thing you need to check I

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,270
but it would it would be really nice to

00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,059
have a kind of our edited clearinghouse

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:31,350
of open source projects that need

00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,179
contributors matching them up with

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,820
skills I know you know sourceforge has

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:42,690
tried and I wouldn't be so like they

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,399
yeah yeah but if anyone know so yeah my

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,200
email address is there and we want this

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,820
for the ADA initiative to because we

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,740
want to be able to provide this kind of

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,380
stuff to women if anyone's aware of a

00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,539
good mechanism of joining enthusiastic

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,149
people with projects that have holes in

00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,559
them that would be poor or wants to

00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:00,559
develop one that would be really cool

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:34,540
just just askin repeat yeah all right

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:37,300
I'll repeat it back so the question is

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,700
what kind of videos do the software

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,130
carpentry one are given that most of us

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,870
aren't actors or video professionals and

00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:49,030
so on what they mostly want is two

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,590
things they want short lectures so that

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,480
is a bit talking heads like I want you

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:55,390
to point a camera at yourself while you

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,370
talk for three minutes about about the

00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,190
software carpentry issue of your of your

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,420
choice they will edit it for you and

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,860
you're supposed to write a script in

00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,660
advance so the idea is that that

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,610
effectively you're following your script

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,410
you make a mistake you just pause for

00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,880
five seconds so that they can cut the

00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,160
video appropriately and then you just

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,200
resume that's one type the other type

00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,720
that they want is screencasts so

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,180
pictures of yourself typing a Python

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,450
program or using a spreadsheet while

00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,190
talking about what you're doing and so

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,750
that second while especially given that

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,850
you write the script in advance is

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,590
probably something easier to contribute

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,650
if you're not really comfortable in

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,480
doing our head to camera kind of video

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,370
but that's the kind of thing they want

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,610
people talking about software

00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,230
development for short periods of time

00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:47,130
but one of the options is screencasting

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,130
yourself using a tool

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:55,789
