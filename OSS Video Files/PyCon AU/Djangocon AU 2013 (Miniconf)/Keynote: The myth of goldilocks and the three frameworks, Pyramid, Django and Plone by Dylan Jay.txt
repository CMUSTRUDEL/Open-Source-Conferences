00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,520
delivers secure supported government

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
websites in the uk and australia

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,199
dylan's also the technical director of

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,600
pretty web a core contributor

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
to plone and dope creator of several

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
open source projects including funnel

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,119
web and host out

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,199
and he also finds time to run the

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,440
monthly sydney python meetups

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,440
so please make him feel welcome

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,920
g'day so i'm going to talk uh this is

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
for anyone who doesn't know what i look

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
like that's what i look like giving a

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
presentation

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,640
so it looks a lot like this um

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,800
so as uh i was just introduced um

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
my name is dylan j i'm a plane core

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,079
contributor i'm not actually a

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
foundation member and uh it was kind of

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
interesting hearing about

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
that a lot of the issues around uh you

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,119
know money versus

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,479
uh you know blessed plug-ins and all

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
that is really interesting comparing

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,880
that to the blown community

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
but anyway plone has a foundation and so

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
on i'm not a foundation member i should

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
need to apply

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
um i've never written a single line of

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
django it said

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
can i tell you it's a little bit

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
intimidating standing in front of all

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
you

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,119
you know really keen django people um

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,640
have uh saying that uh what i have i

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,439
have been is i've been around

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
uh the the traps a little bit my first

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
web application was back in

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
1995 with is api does anyone know what

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,759
is api is yeah

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,560
see yeah very very hesitant uh it's the

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,840
microsoft version of cgi

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,360
i did my first proper website um

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,479
in 1999 on so i started a startup in

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,399
2003 and since 2004 we've been

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,079
doing running consultancy and we now

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,200
focus mainly on government and

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,560
loads of sites um so reasons for this

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
talk the main reason for this talk is

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
that russell asked me

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,360
so and this is what he said he said he

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,720
said you guys are very welcoming that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,599
you have this tradition

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
of uh looking at other frameworks and

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,599
trying to see and learn

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
from what else is kind of out there uh

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
in in

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,680
in the world so

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
my my from my perspective what i wanted

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
to get across

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
um i want to talk a little bit about

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
history i think um

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
there's some really interesting kind of

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
uh

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,959
developments of how frameworks and

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,800
things that have developed

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,120
in um in in the python world and in fact

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
i was at the heck night the sydney

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
django hack night the other night

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
and i met a guy who's really excited

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
about django and he said he was very

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,840
very surprised there are other

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
frameworks in python so

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
i'm sure none of you are like that but

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,400
i'm hoping to sort of illuminate

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
what else is out there and

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,400
so so the other thing is about ignorance

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,560
i'm sure no one here has ever said

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
anything bad about any other frameworks

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,239
particularly frameworks like zopal clone

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,519
but you know it's important to know what

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,959
you're slagging off

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,560
before you slag it off so

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
that's more for the video audience not

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
not you guys um

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
mostly what i want to talk about is

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
making better choices so if you can't

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,599
read that bit at the end it says

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
uh there is no perfect framework only

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,799
the perfect mess after you picked the

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,400
wrong one

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,400
the ones gone missing um

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
so this is my interpretation of a kind

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,480
of a a real

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
rough landscape of a family tree of of

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
how things got invented with regard to

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
the python web

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,440
so you started way back in 99 with uh

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,440
the uh

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,080
the cern http you had cgi

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
um i'm kind of just skipping a little

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
bit there's all this kind of php stuff

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,080
in between but

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,480
let's jump to sort of ruby on rails um

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
python but uh very influential i think

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
i've got the history a little bit wrong

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
here um

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,920
they basically had this explosion around

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
the same time of

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,840
loads and loads of different frameworks

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,760
all inspired or

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
came off the same sources you know from

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,560
hearing the history there it sounds like

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
django was around about the same time

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
not directly influenced by ruby on rails

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
but

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,880
what you have is this big explosion and

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
there's loads of frameworks in that and

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,400
that kind of

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,520
pre-cambrian sort of explosion um now

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
you've got this kind of alternate

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,880
history uh so when you look at the first

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,360
uh release of zop or the first instance

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
of winsor that goes back to 1996 it's a

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
very very long time and it

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
and it comes from a different idea it

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
doesn't come from the idea of using

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,479
routes the same way that ruby on rails

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
or django does

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
and i'm going to explain a little bit

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
about that

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
you had a reinvention of zop a different

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
way of thinking about it which was

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
called zok3 which is a really bad idea

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,000
because you don't

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,840
reinvent something and then call it with

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,280
the number three after it so

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,120
they eventually called that fix that and

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
call it boo bring but the damage had

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
been done but

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,919
really the the bits and pieces of that

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,479
that get reused in other things is

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,600
called

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,360
ztk zop toolkit

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
and my colleague adam terry is going to

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
be giving a good talk about the zop

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
component architecture and so two quick

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,280
which are all

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,520
interesting reusable library bits and

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,639
pieces for configuration

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,880
plug-ins and and

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,240
url sort of stuff that you can do that

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,080
isn't itself a framework

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
then you've got plone which is that i've

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
been mostly involved with um

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,280
so that goes back to 1999 so it is one

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,680
of the uh the first cms's

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
um and what's really interesting about

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
plone is that actually

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
uh is built on top of the original zop

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
but

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,320
still has stuff in there but also took

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
in a whole lot of stuff off the zop 3

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
stuff

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,360
you've got new inventions like flask the

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
advent of kind of micro frameworks

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,199
now you've got bfg bfg and pyramid you

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,639
they don't call themselves a microframer

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
i believe it's a microframework and i'll

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,960
talk a bit about that later

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
that kind of got merged with the pylons

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
thing and became pyramid

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
and you've also got quite a new thing

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
which is these uh static site

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
generations which is another way of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
thinking about uh how to do websites

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
and nickel as an example

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,680
so um a little bit this is the history

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
lesson so this uh this guy here

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,800
so we get a cast of mine backs to 1996

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,960
how many people were coding in 1996

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,960
uh a third half that's pretty cool

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
so things were happening in 1996 you had

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
web servers and and the way a web server

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
works

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
is that you have a path to a file and it

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
just reads the file and serves it back

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,560
that's the way it works

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
cgi's you have a path to a script you

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
execute the script and it takes the

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
arguments and then

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
gets something out of the database based

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
on the arguments

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
the other thing that was happening is oo

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
was really big you know this idea that

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
if you

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
uh you know all your code's going to

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
smell good if you object orientated

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
everything

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,039
and it's and it solves all the problems

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,039
of building complex software

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,560
um so jim fulton was on a plane it's a

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
really interesting story he was on

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
actually a plane uh to do some training

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
on giving cgi but uh

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,160
he'd never done cgi before so he's

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
reading the manual on how to do cgi and

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
he's going

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,639
this is kind of i can do better so

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,400
on the plane back

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,280
he he wrote uh the first version of zoe

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,360
now the essential idea to zoe is this is

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,199
this idea of traversal which is

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
instead of having a path in a file

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,880
system you have a path to an object

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
so that you have an object file system

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,199
so why have dumb

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
html files why not have actual python

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,520
objects

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,280
and then the last bit of the url is the

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
method of the object

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,879
and that's what they called object

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
publishing environment so zop

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,520
is also recursive um acronyms we're also

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,319
big back then so

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
um that's the central idea of how

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
traversal and

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,400
and uh zop works

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
um i'm just going to skip through this

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
stuff the zodb

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
the only that's how the persistent stuff

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,479
works in open plone

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,919
um i think it's what's really

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
interesting is it is actually really

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
easy it's installable by itself it's

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
incredibly fast

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,840
and lets you put anything in there

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
pretty much

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,000
for intense purposes you know if you

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
want a quick persistence layer i

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
definitely recommend it

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,080
um but it has a crapload of stuff in

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
there like it it runs

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,399
some massively big websites including

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,480
most of the ones i'm on call for right

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
now so

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
if it falls over which it pretty much

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,839
never does

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,240
i might get a call so there's a toolkit

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,600
um

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,560
now oh turned out to be not quite so

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
flexible and not such a great idea so

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,120
they kind of learned from that mistake

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,959
and said well we can we can have an

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
architecture that's a bit more flexible

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,440
and it's all about adapters so the idea

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,200
of an adapter is you have an object that

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
maybe has an interface so

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
zope includes this idea of interfaces in

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
python

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
something that you'll get in languages

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
like go or

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
java there is actually an implementation

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,160
of interfaces for python

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,120
it's used by other frameworks as well

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,120
like twisted

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,080
so the idea of an adapter is that you

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,839
have an object with an interface

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
and you want another interface an

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,800
interface is just a promise so you're

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
saying i've got something that

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,160
has this promise and i can turn it into

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,920
something with that promise so

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
it's not about subtype anymore you can

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,880
just say look what i really need

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,720
let's say i really want a twitter feed

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
but i have an rss feed so i have a way

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
to turn

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
something that implements an rss feed

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
interface

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,040
and get this twitter feed interface

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
turns out to be quite a good way of sort

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
of componentizing your application and

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,200
allowing uh

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,200
overriding which is is used a lot in

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
clone

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
traversals so they took this traversal

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
idea where you have uh you know the last

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
part i

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,079
remember the last part of the url was

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,839
the method name

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,200
and all it did was look up this object

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,040
and see what the method names and go

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
okay that's the one

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
um so they reimagined this and instead

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
of having

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
um the traversal then becomes a

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240
multi-adapter where you've got multiple

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,079
interfaces turning into one

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,240
object at the end so you have a

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,880
context which is worked out from the

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,079
path and then you have a request

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
you have the name which is still the

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
last part of the url

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,839
comes out with a browser view which is

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,440
very much like a django kind of view

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,680
class

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,279
and then you render some html it sounds

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
a little bit complicated what it means

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,480
is that there's a really

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,680
easy way to override any view in python

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,839
and sorry in in plone pronouns

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,279
and pyramid inherit some of this so it's

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,519
possible to do a pyramid as well

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,560
so plone so plone

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,240
has 300 plus contributors

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
slightly different model it's a bigger

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,800
framework so we need more people

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,760
contributing

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,279
um 400 plus plugins it actually has

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
thousands but i'm just including the

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
ones that are kind of compatible with

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,880
the latest versions

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,480
um it has a thousand plus commits per

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,440
month uh

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
five to eight sprints per year um the

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,480
sprinting has been a culture of going

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,079
right back um

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,120
in in one of the things that's really

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
kind of

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
been pioneered i think in the plum

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,720
community there's one foundation similar

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
to django

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,079
and security is one of the big kind of

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
selling points i think of plone other

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,680
than

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,760
ease of use and all these other kind of

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
cms things that's one of the reasons why

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,519
i say the fbi use it as their main

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,519
website

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,800
um one thing we don't have in the

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
plumbing community by the way

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
is uh the equivalent of say acquia

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,040
withdrupal which is one big

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,240
hunking company with a lot of money in

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,240
order to spend on marketing

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,079
so i did have um these are

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,839
so you can install it using a unified

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,920
installer blah blah it's pretty

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
or you can actually do an awful lot with

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
things like uh cs

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,519
uh sas services like cloud or r1 called

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,839
prettagov you can create a site really

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
easily

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
so i'm not sure if i'm going to have

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,639
enough time or if the video is even

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,519
going to work

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,519
but i can just

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,880
switch out here

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
i think it's easy if i just show you if

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
you start uploading you get like this

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
something like this so one of the

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,959
interesting things about plone it

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
doesn't start from the root

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,800
it's you can have multiple sites in one

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,000
zone instance so you can create as many

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,399
phone types as you want

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
in the same install so it's multi-site

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
out of the box

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
i've created one already default theme

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,279
but you can change the theme to whatever

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,120
you want

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:10,399
editing click around the place

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,600
so one of the things about it is that uh

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,519
as a as a cms system they uh they don't

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,839
you won't see things like um fonts and

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,839
and colors and stuff it tries to work in

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,880
a way that

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,160
restricts uh you can add all those

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
things you can add all those buttons in

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,639
there but you want

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
you want a consistent style across the

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,600
site so it does things with styles and

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,079
so on

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,160
um and lets you do images and all sorts

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,839
of stuff

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,839
workflow is one of the things that um

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,800
so has all this kind of built in in

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,959
terms of publishing and keeping things

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,920
uh you know hidden until a certain date

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
etc etc

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
but unlike a lot of other systems you've

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
got an awful lot of configuration you

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
can do through here

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,199
like for instance um the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,800
workflow manager you can create very

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,839
flexible custom workflows with multiple

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,079
review steps etc

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,079
um we've got an inbuilt theme editor

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,320
the theming editor is uh really

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
interesting this is one of the big

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,440
things

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,760
previously i would have said that plone

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,320
wasn't the easiest thing to theme

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,000
but the way this theme editor works or

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
the way the actual theming works under

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,880
the hood

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,079
is it's all about pulling the cms

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,360
through into existing html and css

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,040
so that you can get css developed uh hd

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,320
uh javascript developed pull it into a

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
theme you can rip it off existing

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
website

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
and then you've got a theme uh it it's

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,680
incredibly quick it allows you to

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,760
override the html

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,480
of any part of the cms so it makes

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,120
customization very easy

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,360
and by the way it's it will work outside

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,279
a plone it'll work as a whiskey uh

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,000
middleware it's it's a really

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,680
interesting piece of technology

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,760
it's increased decreased the amount of

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,279
time it takes for us to theme sites and

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,120
given us a lot of flexibility and

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,079
they've got this nice little thing here

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,639
where i can say well

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,920
you know if this is the theme here and i

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,560
want this to say

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,760
the main content i can pick this and

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,079
then i can pick this

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,000
and then i can create a where is it

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,600
i can't edit it because i'm it's the

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,079
built-in one i need to copy it

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
um but anyway you can just sort of say

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,880
where you want bits and pieces out of

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
the cms and have it dynamically

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,839
generated

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,000
right

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,279
so adding plugins uses a system called

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
build out which is really interesting

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,079
configuration

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,320
tool um that's the theme editor video

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
skip that overriding is kind of what i

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
talked about

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,279
don't mind the xml a little bit scary i

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,040
know people don't like it but

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
it's essentially the same idea i talked

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,160
about before we

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
we've got this kind of interface layer

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
which means that you know it only

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
applies to one particular section or

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,279
or our particular site and what we're

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
saying is that this particular view

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,360
is able to be overridden because it has

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
a more specific layer or because we want

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
it to do

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
apply to only a specific kind of content

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,279
you know instead of being all pieces of

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,079
content it's only applying to news items

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
for instance so

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,759
user items have their own interface etc

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
etc

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
so you can really target and say i want

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
uh to override this under these

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
circumstances

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
so what about django cms which seems

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
seems to be

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
how many people think django cms is the

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,519
best django cms

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,639
is it the winner there's mezzanine

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,079
there's others there's heaps of them

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
right

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,639
i wasn't sure i wasn't sure but anyway i

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,079
found this um comment on a blog the

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,440
other day so

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,880
i thought well yeah yeah it's it's it

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
it's got a lot of stuff in it it's not

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,399
too bad but it's not as capable

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,680
um there's a bunch of things um content

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,880
types

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,199
didn't seem to be quite there the

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,959
workflow editor built-in search

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,720
essentially like there's a lot of stuff

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,400
here that you may never ever use but

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
what we do is we work with government

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
and they have tenders and they have long

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,640
lists of stuff

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
and these things come up again and again

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
again so if you want

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,319
a really you know capable enterprise

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,400
content management system

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,160
clone more than any other system i've

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
seen ticks all those boxes

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,919
and this is this is a a group that sort

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,919
of

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,200
consults around cms's and one of the

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
interesting things about this graph if

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
you look down the bottom corner there

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
plone's one of the only single

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,400
technology solutions that actually

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,919
crosses sort of three of those little

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
they're all sort of different lines

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
representing

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,039
functionality i think they're the ones

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,640
it crosses our portals and content

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,440
integration

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,919
web content experience and collaborative

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,919
tools

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,840
anyway that's that's one group's take on

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,880
it

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,640
um one of the things i really want to

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,480
talk about is well so how does it apply

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
to you guys how

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
when you're saying well when should i

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
use a framework when should i use a cms

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,799
why do i

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,799
bother should i use django cms etc

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
when you're considering a cms the most

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
important

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
thing to understand is about roles now

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,000
this is a really really important

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
concept that i want to get across so i'm

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
going to i'm going to bring out my big

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,880
guns which is

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,720
lego figurines so you've got the content

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
editor role now the content editor role

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
this is kind of go from

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,840
least sophisticated up to most technical

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
they're the ones who

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
know about content they want to write

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
stuff and put it on a website

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
you've got your site admins they do

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
things like uh you know set workflow

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,400
policies or permissions policies or

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,080
things like that

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,440
um you have reviewers so they uh

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
in fact actually the reviewer should be

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,919
first they're the least technical

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
because all they do is look at that

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,720
there may be a manager and say yeah

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
that's actually the right one to go i'm

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
going to

00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,760
make that live

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,360
you got integrators they're sort of ones

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,919
who install plugins customize a little

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
bit

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,679
know how the customization mechanism

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,799
work and get

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,799
a final site to look um and and bring it

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
all together

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,320
now you have this kind of front-end

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,760
developer fema type person who who knows

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,400
about their javascript

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,679
html and css etc and you have this

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,440
back-end developer or plug-in developer

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
so how does this work with some various

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,720
scenarios let's say

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,720
you've got a developer's blog right

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,799
so they're kind of like a sort of a

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
technical person there

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,000
they've got a bit of technical knowledge

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,559
and they're also uh you know writing the

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
content themselves

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
so static site generation is perhaps a

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,720
really good solution for them you know

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,080
they're familiar with the command line

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,400
they can handle

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,520
writing html if they want um

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,160
um there's there's not a lot of other

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
roles

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,120
needed in that system

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,880
an app an app or a startup

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,919
now there you want uh you've got a very

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
technical team again you've got a

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,960
front-end developer

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,720
you don't really have content editors

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,000
per se most startups don't like if you

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,679
take facebook for instance

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,080
there's lots of user-generated content

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
you've built a site that allows users to

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080
to create content but you've you've

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,720
especially constructed how that

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,480
that user generation of content works

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
and you want complete control over that

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
the number of pages that have words on

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,760
that are pages with you know

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,600
long documents and things like that

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
there isn't a lot of them really

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
so it's a very technical team you want

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
full control over the whole experience

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,960
an app or a startup my definition is

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,880
something you need lots of wireframes

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
for as opposed to say a design mock-up

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,200
something like django pyramid a

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
framework

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,080
so simple blog um you've got a content

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,120
editor they don't really technical

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
and then they're going to pull from the

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,080
cloud they're going to pull a cms

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,520
uh with plugins maybe uh and themes

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
maybe an off-the-shelf theme you know

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,159
like you can with wordpress just pull it

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,520
off the off

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,320
off there maybe change a couple of

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
colors or something

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
wordpress for example

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
it's a large content site now this is

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,280
where you really need all those

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
different roles now

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
this is where a cms comes in because a

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,520
cms is a purpose-built

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,960
piece of software that allows for

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
different interfaces for these different

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
roles

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,760
so you have a content editing interface

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,960
you have a different

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
part of the interface which is to do

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
with you know setting policies and

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,720
allowing policies to happen

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,159
so a bad cms or a simple cms

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
is not going to have as many of these

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,799
different sort of purpose-built

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
interfaces they're going to

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,159
you know you're going to have to go from

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,200
being content editing to jumping deep

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,559
into php to get anything done

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,840
so a good cms tries to really

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,840
have purpose-built things interfaces

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
targeting those different

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,120
roles so you know this

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,320
this is a large content site for a big

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,000
organization say

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
um they've got their own technical team

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,720
they've got an integrated front-end

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
developer on board so they're building

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,679
their own theme in-house

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
but then they're still going to take um

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
maybe they're going to base it off a

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,919
theme off

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
off they're going to download and

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
they're going to

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,559
of course use all those plugins that are

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,559
out there

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
now web consultancy like mine so we have

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,080
you may you may be

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,760
a bit more technical you may have a

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,760
developer you develop your own plugins

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,240
we do develop our own plugins we try not

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
to

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
we want to reuse what's out there but

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,280
you'll have

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,960
the front end developing the theming

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,840
in-house you'll have the

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,280
the integration in-house you're giving

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
it to customers who have their own

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,520
site admins and content editors

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,480
so you need to give them something

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,159
that's really simple for them to use

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,720
and again you're pulling plugins and so

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,720
on off the web

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,679
so that should

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,880
so the reason i put cmsn framework there

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,000
is because it kind of depends what

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
you're doing sometimes you're doing

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,039
things that are a bit happy and

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
sometimes the better result is to

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
actually use a framework instead of a

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,039
cms

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,039
as a consultancy

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,799
so one of the things you face with cms's

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,159
however

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,600
and frameworks is what i like to call

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
the customization clip and i've seen

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,840
this happen over and over again where

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,200
people have said oh my god plone is is

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,760
horrible i've tried to build a uh

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,720
a new facebook using a plone and just

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,440
you know it just

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
doesn't work you know and and what this

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,799
means is

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
with a framework you have a reasonably

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
linear it's not always linear but

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
you have a reasonable linear sort of

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
curve so you start out

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,640
things are pretty easy and you add

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,799
features and and they take work and then

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,760
you get more and more

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,279
but with a cms it looks a bit like this

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,480
right

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,240
you're starting off a lot easier you've

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
got more out of the box when you first

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,559
start

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,559
so you're getting more and more

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
customization more features uh more

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
quickly

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,559
but then if you start to fight the

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
framework if you're trying to do more

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,279
and more stuff if you want something

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
very very customized something like an

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,679
app

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
then you're really fighting the

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,679
framework too much and there's this line

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,960
at which you would have been better off

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,720
if you just started with a framework

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,679
like django

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,039
and you should never have used a cms

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,480
like drupal or anything else

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,200
for that biggest problem with this

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
though

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
is you don't always know where that line

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,279
is you know it's not obvious to you when

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,200
you start out

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
it's it's something that you will know

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
if you know the technology very very

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,919
well and this is

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,960
why in a lot of cases uh doing

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,440
a framework in some ways is

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
the better choice sometimes because you

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,360
will know

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,320
you have that more kind of linear

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,159
predictability it's great if you're uh

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,000
that that really comes into play if

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,200
you're someone like me who has to quote

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
on things and has to estimate

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,080
development and and work out how much

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,960
something is going to cost

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:04,880
having a predictability helps

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,919
so to summarize framework versus cms

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,200
um so frameworks you start with a blank

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,880
page generally

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,240
generally cms's you've got something

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
full out of the box you've got a whole

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
site

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
and then you you customize it down

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
whereas frameworks

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,360
you kind of build up you add in plugins

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,520
and you you kind of

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,279
add the different bits and you build up

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,480
and you only add in functionality for

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
instance when you want it whereas

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,720
there's a lot of functionality out of

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,240
the box with it

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,240
with most cms's um

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,159
so good for app sites good for content

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
where you want to give the content

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,480
uh the responsibility for content to

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
other people

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,200
you you only have those those small

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
amounts of roles that can work on a

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
django site django does have the admin

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,880
you can you can give that over to

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
to people if you're happy with people

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
using the admin interface but it's not

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
something that you can customize so much

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,799
i don't think

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
uh you know it's still a little bit

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,880
technical you're not going to give that

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,559
to all

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,799
non-technical content editors

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,279
whereas the cms has has support for all

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,559
these different kind of roles

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,039
so start to all agency tour

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,760
so with a framework you know back to

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,679
that graph you

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,360
you risk perhaps reinventing things if

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,440
you're trying to build a cms

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,679
uh then maybe you should just use a cms

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,279
whereas with a cms you might risk

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:31,279
hitting this sort of customization clip

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,279
so pyramid uh how am i going for time

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,440
pretty good so pyramid pyramid um

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
they called it uh it's been called a

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
number of things they didn't call it a

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,559
microframer they called it a

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,320
a non-opinionated framework um the

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,840
general idea was like

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
microframeworks you don't come with an

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,279
orm you don't have an admin interface

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,320
you try and be quite lightweight and the

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,039
other thing i was trying to do was

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,200
trying to

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,640
have a lot of flexibility with regard to

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,880
how the url

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,720
works so they have both the routing type

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,400
system as well as the traversal system

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,200
we talked about before um i was also

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,679
designed to be very fast

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,679
um my personal opinion i did i did tell

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,120
this to chris madonna uh when he

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
changed the name to pyramid i wrote him

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
an email that said basically these

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
points so

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,799
this is getting it off my chest i think

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,080
it is the worst name ever django by the

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,440
way very good name

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,480
sounds great uh

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,159
um so pyramid you know the structure and

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,159
we've got pyramid the framework so

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,080
apparently this structure is ancient you

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,440
know not a good you know marketing term

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
to call your framework something that's

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,760
so sort of crusty and ancient

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
uh whereas pyramid is really the

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,799
framework is designed to be the best

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
breeders trying to take the best ideas

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,840
out of everything that was available at

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,600
the time and build something better

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,440
um pyramids just stay exactly the same

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,120
completely unchanging over time

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
one of the things i think about the best

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
things about pyramid the framework is

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,799
that

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,600
it's really extensible and flexible it's

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,600
going to grow with you

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,840
and most importantly a pyramid the

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
structure you've got to start with a big

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,200
base it's really hard to start you know

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,880
you imagine how many slaves you had to

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,559
have to start with i don't know how

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,000
how many meters an average pyramid is

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,120
across right and then you end with a

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,880
small tip

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
whereas pyramid really is about you can

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,960
start with the very smallest

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,000
uh amount of code and then it has all

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,919
the stuff under the

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
the hood that will help build bigger

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,240
apps like like overriding and

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,600
and you know if you want to use

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
traversal in there if you want something

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,159
that's more cmsc then it has that kind

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
of capability

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,240
under the hood so it's got a lot of

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,000
stuff you know it's not just a micro

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,559
framework with

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,440
where you're going to hit this wall of

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,640
well i wish it

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
kind of worked in a slightly more

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,080
flexible way

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
so it's a bit more like that

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,559
um so pyramid it is a micro framework no

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
so

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,520
there are different definitions of what

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
a micro framework is i've heard people

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,559
say that a microphone

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,039
should be written in one file i think

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,799
that's kind of stupid

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,080
um because you're just obviously not

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,279
reusing what's out there

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,799
um but my definition and i'm pretty sure

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
this is what richard jones used the

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,360
other year

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
uh when he does micro framework shootout

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,000
was that it should be able to be written

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
on one you should be able to create

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,120
a small app in one page so that is a one

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,000
page uh

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,760
pyramid app which was actually my

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,679
contribution to pyramid i said

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,880
it's stupid that all these other micro

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,720
frameworks they have a

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
hello world right on smackdang in the

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,159
beginning of their

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,880
front page so i stuck one on the front

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,880
page of pyramid

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,760
so in terms of how this works

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,520
you can see the whiskey stuff getting

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,480
made there you don't have to do it that

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,480
way you can put it in

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,320
in in you gene unicorn or uh whatever

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
you've got this sort of configuration

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
area you can use decorators i didn't use

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,399
decorators here but you can use

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,240
decorators to

00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:00,000
um to do it so you've got this slight

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,080
um added bit here where you're defining

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,679
the root and then you're using the root

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,360
so this bit can go up into the the

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
decorative hello world

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,159
other than that it's it's not that much

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,679
different than a lot of other sort of

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
you know small frameworks you've seen

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,960
but it has a lot of other stuff in there

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,320
it has this declarative authorization

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
system

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,760
and permission system based around

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,320
groups it's quite flexible

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,399
um it has um

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
it has this extensibility this ability

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,360
to um aggregate

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,799
um different python applications

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,480
together

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,760
pyramid application sorry um

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,480
it has the pretty good uh

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,720
internationalization support

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,279
um and it has still has it has the idea

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,279
of

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,880
sort of the interfaces and registrations

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,640
under the hood not something you need to

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
use right off the bat you don't really

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,159
see it at all but it's there

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,320
when you grow bigger and you want to use

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,320
it

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,600
and you can use traversal so here's

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,720
here's it using traversal

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,159
works kind of similar but there's a

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
couple of differences so one you've got

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,480
this resource

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,080
so this is your object so imagine

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,919
this next bit this get root imagine

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,720
that's not just like making up a whole

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,640
bunch of

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,559
things inside things imagine that's like

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,320
a an object that calls things out of the

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,919
database and or is a

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,039
memory structure and what you've got

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,279
right down the bottom here is this

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,080
definition which says

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,760
the context equals resource so if during

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,039
this traversal where it gets the written

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,360
then

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
this will respond to a url that says uh

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,360
you know

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,360
a slash b c

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
then it's going to render it using the

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,279
hello world view which is there

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,600
so and it takes you can get access to

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,320
that

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,919
context so that context again could be

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
taken out of a nosql database it could

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,399
be taken out of an orm it could

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,399
come from anywhere

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,480
um this form of of of

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,679
you know managing urls uh it's not for

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
every kind of application it's really

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,840
good for cms

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,120
applications where you're really kind of

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,000
concentrating on the objects and the

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
content

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,120
and all your things have a kind of a

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,559
hierarchical structure

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
nice thing about pyramid is you can mix

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,120
and match you can have both of them

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,440
working together for different parts of

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,440
the app

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,559
so this is kind of i don't have that

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
much advice when it comes to sort of

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,159
micro versus

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,120
uh you know i mean i'm talking to a room

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,799
full of django

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,880
people so i'm not going to convince any

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,919
of you to switch from django to another

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,720
lightweight framework

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
i'm imagining so if you know a framework

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,039
already you should probably use

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,600
that that's a good idea

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,880
i think if you a really important

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,159
question of which framework you should

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,559
use should be around

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,440
you know access to developers access to

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,600
easy answers

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,360
what's been done already plugins etc and

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,640
that's clearly in the python space is

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,679
django

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,279
and that's that's a fantastic thing the

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,120
admin stuff do you want

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,840
you know that kind of extra rail sort of

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
stuff that's that's definitely a django

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
or are you trying to use the admin to

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,080
really uh

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,919
emulate or or create a cms uh

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,760
you know maybe you should be thinking

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,240
about a cms at that point maybe django

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,960
cms

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,000
do you want your own db well i think it

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,440
used to be the case

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,440
uh that you you kind of uh

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,039
were working against django a little bit

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,159
if you if you threw at the orm and you

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,039
threw out that and you wanted to use

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,480
nosql

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,399
um my understanding is not really the

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,360
case anymore so there's less of this

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,039
kind of you know

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,640
if you want nosql go with a micro

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,440
framework if you don't

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,840
if you if you do want sql then go with

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,840
django

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,840
my opinion if you want to go micro i

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,960
think i think pyramid is a really good

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,200
one to check out

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,880
and i shamelessly borrowed this from the

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,159
drupal community i love this phrase you

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,679
know the elevator that goes all the way

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,679
up you're not going to get stuck halfway

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,679
so one of the interesting things that

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,919
comes up you know i've talked all about

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,200
cms versus framework and

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,119
what happens if you've got something

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,560
that's a bit of both and it happens more

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,079
than you think you know you've got

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,440
something that's largely a content site

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
and you're going to have an application

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,079
what are you going to do

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,560
so i'm going to show a couple of uh

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,399
sites there's mainly sites we've done so

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,000
so you can use iframes that's one way to

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,000
do it this is how this happened because

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,399
of various historical reasons this

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,919
emergency services bid is actually it's

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
not even a real application it's money

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,520
javascript but it had

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,639
that it had to be served uh locally

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,760
because of the way it was synchronized

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,159
and so on

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,879
um you can use iframes iframes obviously

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,960
have their own

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,399
problems about um you know sizing you've

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,839
got to have an exact size

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
it's not so flexible

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,800
but so what we're really talking about

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,240
here is we're talking about uh

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,119
where you've got mostly content and you

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,240
want to put something appy in there

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,680
here's something we did where one thing

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
that a lot of people don't do they what

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,040
they try and do

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,079
a lot is they try and uh with cmss and

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,000
they want something kind of

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
application-ish in there is they'll try

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,119
and reuse lots of stuff that kind of

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,800
almost does what they want

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,960
and then just end up in a big kind of

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
mess because it you know they're

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,480
they're spending too much time

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,240
customizing and trying to get it to do

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,680
things it doesn't do

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,760
i think a lot of time if you just go

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,119
back to the base framework most cms's

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,280
have some kind of base framework

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,320
underneath if it's a php cms then you've

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,119
got php

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,200
a lot of php cms's are built on top of

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,480
mvc frameworks on top of php you can use

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,839
that

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,280
plone is built on on top

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,800
so it has its own framework so

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,480
this is an example where we upload all

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,240
the database uh

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,240
all the timetabling information

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,520
and stick it in there and you can pick

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,560
the roots and it shows all

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,240
that another one we recently did all of

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,760
new south wales has to you have to

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,359
register your pool anyone got a pool in

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,280
new south wales

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,240
you should be using this before the 29th

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,160
of october otherwise you will get fined

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,440
um in this case what we really want to

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,119
do was we wanted to

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,560
a lot of the content we still wanted to

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,079
have people be able to update it

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,079
themselves so we chose to use something

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
called pomona which is kind of like a

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,119
lightweight frame on top of the cms

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,680
itself

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,680
so it's another way to do things

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,040
we didn't do the site but what these

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,839
guys are doing is actually they're

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,480
proxying

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,720
uh so when most of the uh all the

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,000
content on on 131 500

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,520
is uh is is using plone

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,119
and then when it comes to this plan trip

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,320
planner it proxies the requests and they

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,960
go through

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,760
to this you know custom trip planning

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
system

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,640
which is run on these other servers and

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,720
the results come back

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
in general not a really good idea to do

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,880
this by the way

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,400
it has means your your cms or your

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,359
application is mostly sitting around for

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
something else

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,520
and there's all sorts of scalability

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,599
issues with that sometimes

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,200
um there's a few other methods um you

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,640
could just use separate domains in

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
separate urls this happens all the time

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,119
you'll have

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
you know the blog the company blog which

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,200
is blog.you know whatever

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
in wordpress and then you'll have uh you

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,079
know the rest of the site

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,359
app or something uh written in whatever

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,800
your favorite framework is

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,480
each site includes a really interesting

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
one we've been doing some stuff recently

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,960
using uh

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,400
this kind of hybrid edge site includes

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,800
proxy technique where

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,000
we it's like doing a proxy but it

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
happens in the middleware

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,760
um so all the security happens at the

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,800
clone level we check that first and then

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,800
the proxying bit

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,320
then we release the the clone threads

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,240
and let it go back into the

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,240
our reverse proxy stack and make the

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,680
request from there

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,920
actually works pretty well it's pretty

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:51,040
cool

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,200
so in summary cmss are good for content

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
cms is good for non-technical editors

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,599
where you need to give it to someone

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,200
else who

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,280
doesn't have to have uh you know be a

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,119
django core contributor to edit the

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,839
content

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,440
frameworks are good for unique apps a

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,960
cms is good for

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,920
content and unique apps sometimes

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,920
if you know what you're doing

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,800
but pretty much you can do anything you

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,240
want if you know what you're doing

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,359
the more complex the framework the

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,359
harder it is to know what you're doing

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,359
but trust me i'm professional i do know

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,880
what i'm doing

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,640
but we're also hiring so if you know

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,400
what you're doing then

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,400
have a chat to me thank you

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,640
thanks dylan any questions from the

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,640
floor

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,560
there's always a question um okay so

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,839
you you made this sort of there's this

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
crossover point between

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,320
framework and cms payoff and the the

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,680
natural competitor for plone

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,119
is really something like drupal and you

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,320
said you're you're competing feature for

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,400
feature not

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,440
the fact that plone is written in python

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,280
and

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
uh drupal's written in php so that the

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,000
underlying language is

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,800
from that come from that level of

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,320
competition almost entirely irrelevant

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,440
the however from the other end when

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
you're looking at the frameworks the

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,680
language is really important because

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
you're spending most of your time

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,680
working in the language

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,359
the crossover point comes when okay so

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,119
we we do want to add an additional

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,960
feature write an additional plug-in

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,160
extend the extra bit for to plone

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,160
and we need to know we're writing in

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
python how

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,480
i don't know if you said and you alluded

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
to this sort of point at the end there

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,359
are ways you can sort of

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,599
hybridize and and get around the problem

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,520
that way but can you can you elaborate

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,000
at all on

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
how hard writing the plugins are inside

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,680
clone

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,920
and so how far can you stretch

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,880
plone before it's sort of it becomes it

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
becomes the point where you really

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,359
should be using a framework or you

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
really do need to be digging very very

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,680
low level

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,960
um i think i

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
the real answer that could you can

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,240
stretch an awful long way you can

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,359
um like all kind of communities and and

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
this has kind of alluded to when you

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,839
guys are talking about like blessed

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,119
plug-ins and stuff like that

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,119
the biggest problem with clone is it's

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,119
been around since 1999 so there are

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,960
multiple ways of doing things so

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,400
there are really easy great ways of

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
doing things like browser views and

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,640
things like that but there's also an

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
older way of doing things

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,240
and that makes it harder than it should

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
be so sometimes it's actually not that

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,200
hard

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,040
if we could clear away that craft and

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,240
and all the old documentation say look

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,599
you know this is the one we're doing

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,359
things and there's been a lot of efforts

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,319
in that regard

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,200
but you know you've got the dexterity

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,319
framework

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,280
which is a content forget it

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,000
um it's a content um types framework

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,240
it's um

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,760
being rejigged from the old framework

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,640
really easy just to create whole new

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,640
objects and everything

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,000
so um

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,000
uh

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,200
i'm over here yeah um

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,640
yeah so so browser views i think um you

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,079
know they're

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,280
a little more complicated say than

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,880
django views but they're not that much

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,720
more complicated so you've got

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,000
a couple of different building pieces

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,520
which are actually

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,040
reasonably straightforward for building

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,880
applications um

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,800
i think yeah the biggest danger is some

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,359
of the old stuff and also the

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,119
the uh the temptation to reuse stuff

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,079
that's already there and that screws

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,480
people up

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:35,839
i guess more than than the reality of

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:35,839
how easy it is

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,359
um one of the arguments i've seen for

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,160
pyramid is that

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,520
since so much of what you would use is

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,319
more of a library than built into the

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,160
framework

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,599
such as the db layer a lot of people use

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,400
sql alchemy

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,960
that you could reuse those components

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,480
across

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,160
say a cms and a framework and

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,599
for a site where you need those

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,520
different components do you see that

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,440
happening in practice much or

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,560
uh yep yep i mean there's there's been

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,040
some pretty large

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,599
um uh installations where they've done

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,400
just that

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,280
um they've uh for various reasons

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
they've

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,720
used plone say um because one of the

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,640
things is that um

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,240
there's integrations with zodb and stuff

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,240
like that so

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,440
uh people have used plone to do all the

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,800
editing and everything and they've got

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,640
this kind of separate

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,400
admin interface and then they've used

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,079
connected pyramid up to the zodb and

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,000
they've got this blindingly fast you

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,920
don't have all the craft of all

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,280
the extra bits and pieces of framework

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,680
to do with editing

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,200
in your request layer so you can have an

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,520
anonymous view layer

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,800
um accessing the same data out of the

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,839
zodb

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,960
so there's been a few

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,240
installations like that you can do

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
exactly the same thing with

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,079
sql alchemy where you can just yeah hook

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,520
it up to existing

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,200
database and then have that same

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,800
database used by

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,880
some other application say you know

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,079
another cms for instance pulling content

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,240
out of that

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
so

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,480
i'll ask the last question we've heard a

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,440
lot today

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,160
um about uh well questions about the

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,720
future

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,440
of the web and how django what django's

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,720
place in it

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,880
is do you have a characterization of

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,240
uh how plone is dealing with those

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,000
questions is it comfortable

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,880
is it worried um

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,520
i think yeah i mean i think the you know

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
the hardest thing for a cms to grapple

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,839
with is those different roles so you

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,200
have to

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,839
you have to build something that's not

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,480
only uh easy for the core developers

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,319
um to to edit and work with but you have

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,920
to use something that's easy for

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,359
end users now the problem you have with

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,880
an open source community is the people

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,680
with the most influence are those core

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,880
developers

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,800
so you'll often end up with things

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,319
becoming more technical than they should

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,400
and not understanding the problem

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,880
the issues that an integrator has like

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,079
if they're coming into plone uh

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,599
how do they uh how do they edit um

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,280
you know how do they take a theme and

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,720
you know traditionally some of the

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,240
things they've had to do is like plone

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,920
is very set up tools based you've got to

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,200
learn about packages and stuff like that

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,640
something that django avoids but uh

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,560
it's it's something that you have to

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,000
learn about in order to start writing

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,119
python code in

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,760
in plone um so i think this is this is

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,760
the hardest thing

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,040
my personal opinion is that plone should

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,640
be going much more through the way of

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,640
the coding and happening

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,400
you could see that i showed you the the

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,960
diazo's kind of theme editor where you

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,800
could do

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,560
a lot of customizations directly in the

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,920
interface i think that sort of thing

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,440
should happen more

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,760
it allows a kind of a sas type

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,200
service to exist and work really well

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,839
because you can have really customized

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,560
sites

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,079
using you know purpose built in uis and

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,920
you don't have to

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,520
know about git or code pushing or

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,200
anything like that

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,920
and that will be the the bit that gets

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,319
people in

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,160
you know uh there's all sorts of things

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,720
about um

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,440
you know other cms's like like wordpress

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,359
like

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,280
hosting is much cheaper with wordpress

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,880
than it is with anything that involves

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
an application server like clone or

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,599
django right

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,040
that's a barrier to entry for new people

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,319
and some of those new people are never

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,000
going to be core contributors they're

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,760
never going to grow the community

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,920
but some of them are right you know and

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,119
and we as developers are just as lazy as

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,720
everyone else we like something that's

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,319
simple to understand

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,000
and simple to get started and be

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,119
productive with and that

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,359
that little bit of you know ease of ease

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,200
of use at the beginning

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,800
grows the community and i think django

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,640
has done that really really well

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
and that's something i think that plone

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,920
should really look at about ways in

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,079
which to make it

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,520
more accessible and get more done with

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:47,839
less at the beginning

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:47,839
great thanks very much dylan thank you

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,560
