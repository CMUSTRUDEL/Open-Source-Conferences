	00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,720
are we on yep okay all right ladies and

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,920
gentlemen welcome to the lightning talks

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,440
for those of you who haven't been to a

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,960
lightning talk session before the rules

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
are easy

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,719
five talks enter one talk leave no um

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
the rules are you have five minutes you

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
have exactly five minutes and that is

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,680
all you have at the end of five minutes

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
alarms will go off and we expect people

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
to throw things at the people on the

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,840
stage and they will get thrown off if

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
they don't get off the stage

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
um other than that the the mic is open

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
you can talk about anything you want as

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,199
long as it's not an advert or

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
a advertisement or job advert um and uh

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
at which point i will turn the floor

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
over to tim

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,920
tim ansel talking about tim's finance

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,559
your time starts now

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
okay um so who was here at pycon last

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
year

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
um surprisingly a lot of you haven't

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
been

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,760
um so last year there was this talk

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,520
um at the primary hello everyone my name

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
is roger i've had too much coffee and

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,160
i'm going to tell you about scraping

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
websites

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,079
okay some sites should be about two this

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
one in particular some sites suck for

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
your own good

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
so this is a bank of which i'm a member

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,159
and i wanted to get my bank account

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
balance without having to press all

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
these buttons and

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,479
they do this lovely thing where they

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
rearrange the buttons on you every time

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
and

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
it sounds like a pretty good scraping

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,280
challenge to me and

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
basically it drove me insane so

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
this website works in a web browser

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
let's use the web browser to scrape them

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,080
enter selenium everyone's heard of

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
selenium right you automate web browsers

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
that's

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,720
what it does it does navigation elements

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,240
runs javascript takes screenshots

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
lots of really cool stuff and it works

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
in python so general recipe you get

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
firefox you get firebug

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,360
you get selenium ide you get python you

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,759
get python selenium

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
you mix it all together pi virtual

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,439
display is optional if you don't want to

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
actually

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,000
show the browser on the screen and you

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
install all of that you start up firefox

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,759
and you

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
start recording your session through

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,720
firefox save that out as a python

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
unit test that you can run you can start

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
asserting things and from there you can

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,079
really

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,479
start hacking around with it and doing

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,040
some fun things so

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
basic recipe record your test that's

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
what an example looks like you

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
fire up a url you click on some buttons

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,640
but

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,200
what about that keypad it changes every

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,120
time

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
not only that the buttons are actually

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
images

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,000
that's not good there's no way to find

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
out

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
really easily what button is the two

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
which button is the seven so you can

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
press them and log in

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,599
you're frozen

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
well the network is currently not very

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
working but

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
what he'll go on to say is he does some

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
horrible things using

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,959
shards of images to effectively

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
screen scrape um a login page into his

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
bank

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
so then he can get his

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,080
bank details about um

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
a year and a half before i saw this

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
lighting talk i had had the same idea so

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,319
it turns out you know

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,120
fools will think alike and i started

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
writing a pro

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
project which uh very vainly named tim's

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
finance because

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,640
i can't come up with a better name so

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
tim's finance is basically a tool which

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,560
is supposed to import all your

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,239
bank transactions into a django oerm

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
database and then you can do

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
cool things like graph them classify

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
them

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
all those type of things that

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
accountants don't seem to like and i

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,799
can't hear

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,239
them um

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
uh so i just wanted to introduce tim's

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,959
finance

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
again i haven't had any time to work on

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
it since

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,200
um about two years ago when i started

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
so if anybody's interested i'm quite

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,360
happy to help you with it but i probably

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,640
won't be doing more on it myself

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,159
um so there's

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,200
um test finances up on github under my

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
thing just github dot com

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,000
mithra tim's finance um it turns out

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
that um

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,480
banks are

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,720
instead of giving you a nice id for a

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
transaction that says you know

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
this is the transaction it has a unique

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,239
id if something happens about this

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,040
transaction we'll reference it that way

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
um they give you a description and a

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,359
number

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,120
which don't always stay the same stay in

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,720
the same order

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,080
um pretty much anything you'd expect

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,800
consistent to happen um doesn't so

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
i've done the hard work of um oops

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,919
that's not the wrong

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,280
of figuring out all the different things

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
that can go wrong

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,680
like things going backwards in time

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
and um it now

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,720
is able to deal with things like

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,600
multiple transactions with the same day

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
same day same num description and those

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
things going around

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,840
so all you have to do is give me a csv

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,320
file so

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,919
if you want to help me a good way to

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
would be to write one of these selenium

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,240
driver things

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
and give me a cssv file which i can then

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
import

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
i then run it through classifiers so you

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
just basically give it a regex and you

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,199
know if it's got taxi in the description

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,520
it will decide it's a taxi fare

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,600
it also does interesting things like

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,479
extracts currency information from

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
descriptions

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
some of them banks like combat give you

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,199
this

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,199
thing was already in there

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:39,840
i also link transactions and

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,840
am able to deal with transfers

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
thank you very much tim next up is jacob

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,880
hazelhurst talking about permission

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
migrations and we have a slight grace

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
period here

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
to make sure all the connections

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,440
actually connect up uh you have the oh

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
uh

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
shut up hang on where'd it go

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
okay yes

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,840
all right okay jacob your time starts

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
now

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,360
oh sorry yes you do all right you get

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,840
that time back then

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,840
your time starts now uh

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,319
uh my hi my name is jacob i'm at hzy

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,840
underscore on twitter and i work for a

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,199
company called gizmag

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,440
one thing that we've come into with

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,479
django over the last few months is our

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,599
permission migrations

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
with uh gizmag we have a number of

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
user groups writers editors

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,599
administrators and developers

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
and each user group has a different

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,960
level of

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
permissions that they're able to perform

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,080
things upon in our system

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,160
the systems for an online magazine so

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,479
that's how it kind of all fits together

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,680
and an example of some permissions

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,319
is uh editors plus sort of permission

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,319
group

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,520
they can use the article can publish

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,560
privilege and then administrators plus

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,879
have the additional privileges of

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,800
setting the writer of an article and

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
setting the publish that date of an

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
article

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,800
um so the challenge we came up to was uh

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
how do we apply these permissions

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,039
to groups and uh we had some

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
requirements for that they had to be

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,160
usable in tests

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
and it has to be able to evolve over

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,520
time

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,879
to solve this we came up with django

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
permission migrations

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,599
which is a little package that we've

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
pulled out of our code base

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
and i'll just quickly go over how we use

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,560
it

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
so this is a very basic example of one

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
of our models and you can see that our

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
permissions are

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
put in like that into the meta of the

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
model

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,240
and then uh we have to use this uh

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,440
little block of copy paste code

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,360
uh in the in it pi of the

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
of the project and what that does is

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
every time you're on syncdb

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,159
it checks if you've added more or taken

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,760
away

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,080
permissions from from

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,200
the the meta permissions there and it

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,160
will apply them to the database

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,760
and then we then have to create an app

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,120
for permissions

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,040
and then create an initial migration

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
and this is the kind of structure that

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,440
you'll see so we have our permissions

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
out part of the project

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
and then within that we have various

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,000
migrations that

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,760
will apply the permissions to

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
uh various user groups uh

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
we're in the then we go under the

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
settings.pi and inside of that we have

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
the permissions app which has to be last

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
in the installed apps

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,880
because it requires all of the

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
permissions from the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
other apps to have already been created

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,839
um

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
and then we have our we declare our

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
permission groups here

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,760
so editor plus group contains the

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,399
editors administrators and developers

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,560
groups

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,040
or our admin plus group contains

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
administrators and developers

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,279
uh and then when we go to use that

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
inside of a migration

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,839
uh this is a basic example of one here

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
we use it just like we would a regular

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
south migration

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,040
and then we just declare a list for each

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,080
group

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,720
which permissions we'd like to apply

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
and then just run python managed apply

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,839
and migrate

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,839
and that's it thanks

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,120
okay thank you very much jacob next up

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
is frank sainsbury with why acronyms are

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
nbg

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,800
1280 by 10 24. you're you're 1280 by 24

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
resolution

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
yeah stop running

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,279
all right your time starts now

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,680
frank sainsbury speaking hello everybody

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,200
why acronyms are in bg with apologies to

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
any russians in the audience

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
i'm working on a project called which

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,360
was originally called hero

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
health impacts research assessment but

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,959
my russian friend says

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,959
that's a very bad idea for a name

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
right we'll get off the wonderful

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
pictures of russian tanks which was

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,839
about the only sort of

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
vaguely sort of thing and talk about

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,320
piracy

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,240
we're not into piracy we're probably

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
pretty reasonable most days

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,399
um but he's a good pirate but like all

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,839
wood pirates he's pretty

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,760
poor very poor indeed get out of it

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,120
um and across we go okay so this is the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
little

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,360
website that we're working on where

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,279
we've got a hundred million bits

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
i think this project is significant for

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
several reasons one

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
it's attempted to use every form of

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,200
technology i could get my hands on

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,639
we have got java we've got javascript

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
we've got php

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
we have considerable quantities of

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,880
python looking about

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
i mentioned javascript didn't i and

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
anything else that goes on the web we're

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
running

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
mysql database and postgres databases i

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,560
am trying to

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079
minimize some of those and move it all

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,240
over to postgres but there you go

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
so what it is here or about or in fact

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,279
they've come up with a new algorithm

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
new name which i'll have to read because

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,040
i'm going blind

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,320
community health and well being

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
assessment i think

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,680
essentially what they want to do is they

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
all reckon climate change is going to

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,279
really seriously affect

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,639
the poorest people in our community that

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,800
means

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,320
they will have to organize themselves

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
and we'll have to organize as much as we

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
can

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,839
give them as much information so that

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
they can

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,320
adapt or plan or do something to make

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,800
their life

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
livable it's particularly relevant for

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
poorer rural areas

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,000
tasmania puts a hand up for that which

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
is pretty shocking

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
it particularly affects us not so much

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
in the west after death but

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,079
the farmers going broke or shooting

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,440
themselves which is pretty bad news

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,440
i don't know how many of you had that

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,399
happened to a friend of yours i've had a

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
couple

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
suicide is just bad news and

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
particularly when it's caused by a

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,279
preventable economic thing

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
okay so we need to get rid of those

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
things out of it

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
the particularly nasty piece of work

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
that i might have to

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,880
do is with this wonderful thing the taga

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,480
data server portal

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,600
it takes net cdf files uh reads them

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,120
um anyway so that's where that is that's

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
that's

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
in the data i've deployed it onto the

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
the server there

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,160
and you can just browse into a file

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,000
marvelous

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,199
although what the problem is is of

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,760
course that

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,720
you have to deconstruct that work out

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
how big it is

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
carry on whatever and it's going to take

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,279
forever so let's not do that

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,120
that is poor go back to the page

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,959
um right so what we did from that was we

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,800
built this thing

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,600
and that's the non-working version but

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,360
essentially that's an html5

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,560
chart with a

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,320
data portion which is an xl spreadsheet

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
what we did was we pulled the data out

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,959
of tager and i can't see where i've

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,040
gotten that

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,240
uh it's back in there on that that page

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,519
there we

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,120
say george um son george

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,959
pulled it out and put it so that

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,160
you pulled up that page then pulled it

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,600
out of the tagger server

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,600
changed one that's broken okay marvelous

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
poor demo should should do these things

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,519
more carefully when we're going

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,800
and the the other bit of it that we want

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,800
to see

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,000
is come on work your stupid thing

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,040
ah i did that did that do that

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,959
did that oh this thing okay so the first

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,040
effort of trying to pull out the textual

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,480
data we have in tasmania they did 29

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
council studies

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
uh with so we have a map which in which

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
we play some information we choose a

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
region

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
anywhere we'll do fire it off it pulls

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
out

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,720
some textual information related to it

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,880
there isn't any was it just no is it

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
just taking forever

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,760
uh or just gone and decided to break on

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,600
me just right when i didn't want it to

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,560
maybe anyway so there you go so

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
is that no it's broken it's broken all

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,120
right

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,959
marvelous and so oh well demonstrations

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
are like that i did not sacrifice a

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,680
chicken anywhere

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,920
and this is what so anyway what we

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,680
wanted to look like is this i went to

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,560
govhack 2013 we won but these guys

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,000
won a lot of prizes too they plotted all

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,680
the genocky waterways

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
and then they had a thing so you could

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,880
tag information on it

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,680
so this django project we want to

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,800
use to and there you are that's actually

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,399
what should have been up there a

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
description of grenorky and

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
how its weather's going to go so we want

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
to use this to join those

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,800
various data sets together and get going

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,959
you're supposed to have gone 10987654

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,160
how the hell am i supposed to do this

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:14,079
thank you ladies and gentlemen again

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,600
sorry oops i dropped the ball there

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,600
okay next up is chris beaven

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:37,839
you need uh

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:51,839
uh yes can you do 1024

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:05,839
i should be married

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,640
all right okay chris your time starts

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
now

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
all right so i've got a pretty menial

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,319
topic to discuss uh it's got a

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
point at the end of it though so in

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,360
navigation menus uh there are lots of

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,799
these ones like site tree that

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
i think it was simon talked about

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,120
earlier on in the day

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,919
so i wrote my own one my invention the

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,200
wheel

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,640
it's the nav tag so i i always was

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
frustrated that these things

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
probably because i wrote it i wrote one

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
myself back in about 2008 a navigation

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
menu solution

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
that used ugly classes and all of this

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
stuff in the database and then i was

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
thinking

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
really this is just navigation this is

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,720
just template logic

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
it should happen in the template layer

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
so i made a script that made it simple

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,679
and easy

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,520
so you have a block like you're in your

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
side of your standard django template

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,039
and you use the nav tag and you just say

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,160
nav home it's just setting a simple

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,000
variable

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,760
and then you call your super stuff which

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,840
will have the actual nav

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
which is below so that would that was

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,080
what's below would be what's in your

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
main

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
in your base template it's your basic

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,240
navigation you've

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,039
got a navigation for home fruit and

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,000
contact

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,240
so that's what it would look like um

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
you've specified home at the top and you

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,039
can

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,000
you just use this method to um to access

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,919
that

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,880
now you can also have hierarchical trees

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,200
so you can have fruit dye apples

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,919
and it'll be true for both fruit apples

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,480
and fruit

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,919
so you can have fruit highlighted and

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
bananas highlighted

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
and it all works it's just very simple

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
so my

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,520
my end point is sometimes you just don't

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
need to over over complicate the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
solution

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
you get all these packages that often do

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,320
a lot more than

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,400
you may need to do so sometimes it takes

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,919
a it's a good idea to step back

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
and see what you can do with a more

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,880
simple solution so this is a

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,720
tag that i wrote on django snippets and

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,640
yes simon it should be packaged

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,880
it was in 2009 and i don't think i've

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,520
actually made any changes to it

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
and it's still working on sites that i

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
write today so

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
yeah you can write things that still

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
stand the test of time and

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
thank you

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
there we go fast talk is a good talk

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:53,840
okay next up is lex hyda

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:53,840
with pandas and ponies

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,600
dude

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
get on

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:23,360
no you're good

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
oh you're not down here

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,840
yep now you could open on that display

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:49,840
oh okay uh you want the arrangement

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,120
okay all right

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
hello thank you lex your time starts now

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
okay my talks

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
called pandas loves ponies uh on

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
blackstraw chocolate on

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,120
twitter and lecture one github um so we

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
all know the django pony one of the best

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,280
uh

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,280
mascots ever uh

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
we've got pandas has anyone used or know

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,799
what pandas is

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,360
oh great um pandas is like

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,320
r um but written in python and much

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,400
better

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,679
it's kind of like in-memory sql or

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
in-memory uh

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,600
excel table it's awesome it's built on

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
numpy

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,159
sci-fi stack and

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,760
pandas loves pony so how can we get

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
these two working together

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,840
pandas really do love ponies um

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,960
i've kind of covered most of that so we

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,360
can do uh joins kind of like sql from

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
in memory we can do group by uh pivot

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,320
tables plotting

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,120
um reading csvs reading from excel files

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
reading from

00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
sql

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,840
this is reading from a csv file into a

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
data frame

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,640
again it's just a 2d data structure a b

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,760
c and d could be any column names that

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,640
our data has and then we can do all

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,799
kinds of um

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
calculations on it so this is you know

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,799
means

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,880
uh quintiles max min there's all kinds

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,640
of things you can do with your data

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,840
uh you can read it from sql but

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
you can't read it from django

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
uh yes you can there's the code to do it

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,440
two lines

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,240
um values from a query set

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,840
call that to the data frame constructor

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
and you've got a data frame

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
um it's got a 2html which will output a

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,200
string

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,559
of html so you can stick that in your

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
templates if you would like pass that

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
around

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,799
and that's how hard it is to write your

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,880
data back out to a csv file

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,080
um so i've written a library called

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,919
pandas loves ponies

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
uh was released on valentine's day this

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
year

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
and this is getting data from a data

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,400
frame into django

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:15,120
and it's that easy install my library

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
create a data frame and then call to

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,400
django

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,039
data frame it figures out all your field

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,799
names

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,200
matches up to the columns it'll do a

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,120
bulk create to make it fast if you like

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,400
if you give it the update flag

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,400
it will update ones that match your data

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,200
so it's this easy to read say sales data

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,159
from a csv

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
in from the csv file stick it into your

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
database

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,360
the end so

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
some useful things you could do pandas

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
has

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,880
built in google analytics

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,559
that's how easy it is to pull your data

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,559
out of ga into a data frame

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,360
and so that's how hard it is to put ga

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,400
data into your database

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,520
pretty easy so

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,679
the second library that i've written is

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,919
called cycad play does the same thing

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,840
but for adobe's ga which is called

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,240
um they keep changing their name it's

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,279
called site catalyst

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,640
um so just to wrap up i'm giving a talk

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,400
tomorrow on salt

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
unfortunately it's the same time as

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
jacob's giving his talk

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,960
so so that i don't you can't really see

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
that but so i don't talk to an empty

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,640
theater you should come see my talk on

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,240
salt it's awesome

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,840
and security is really overrated who

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,840
needs it

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,559
and there will be jokes

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
finally we're hiring at the moment if

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,640
you live in melbourne or you know

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
someone who

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,120
has a django talk to me

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,559
i've got a minute left yes can i take

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
questions on the lightning talk no all

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,159
right that's it

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,559

yeah at the bottom

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:57,840

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
your time starts now um g'day my name's

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,279
humphrey

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,520
um i kind of feel a bit weird coming on

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,440
before the next lightning talk but um

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,799
one thing that's kind of bugged me a

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,159
fair while about jengo and it's not

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,679
necessarily jango's fault

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,240
but i just never was happy with how to

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,760
render forms i didn't like just

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,520
wrapping them in you know like the

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,520
default way you know that's kind of how

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,039
the documentation says to customize them

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,880
and it's a lot of effort and for me it

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,480
was a lot of repeating myself

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,559
so back when i was a young django

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
developer like four or five years ago i

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,200
was like

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
yeah i'll copy how the django admin does

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,720
it and so i created this like field sets

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
thing in a form and made this

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,320
inheritance kind of thing so all my

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,520
forms inherited from my funky

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,200
form type and then i tried to do pretty

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,799
much the same thing but where it looped

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,799
over like django admin did

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,679
and it was kind of ugly and really hard

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,760
to maintain and really hard to debug

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
so recently i have

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,080
cool i kind of come up with this it's

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
very simple code um

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,520
and it's yeah i just really like how um

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
so basically it's just a

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,440
django template filter called render

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,200
form um there's the

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,720
the template to output it to and then a

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,880
list of um

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
mr fields to render so that solves my

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,320
problem that i don't have to

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
i can just choose where to place my form

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,640
so i can lay out forms wherever i want

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,080
and then when i started using bootstrap

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,960
and doing a bit more javascript

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,840
i needed more customization so if i do a

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
field with

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,440
a dot class name that just adds that

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,640
class name to it

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
and i can also um if i want to add an

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,000
attribute to a field i just basically do

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,760
that and

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,840
i can add those things in which means i

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,360
can hook into bootstrap really easily

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,120
and other any other kind of thing just

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,039
by changing the template

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,640
for the fields that i want like that

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,640
so i really like that because it's just

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,200
really really simple

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,559
wrong shortcut that's pretty much the

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
code for it

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,720
so um it doesn't really need to be a

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,159
reusable app but i um package it up like

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,159
that to make it easier for myself

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,760
and you guys can have a look at the code

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
and completely change it and

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,760
make it um how you're done however you

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
want it i've chucked a few templates in

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
there um which

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,399
and there's some bootstrap templates and

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
basically that's what all the template

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,120
does

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
but it's just my way of not repeating

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,720
myself

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,320
so be inspired and come up with your own

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,000
way to do things like that

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,120
and if you are interested

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
uh that's the uh the github thing

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,240
and i guess i managed to get my first

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,240
name as a username come on

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
thanks

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,840
okay so 1024

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
okay

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
oh

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,679
there you go all right

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,679
okay

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,480
hi so my name is danielle madeley um

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,919
this is actually synergistic that

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,840
my talk is following the last one

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,880
because this is almost a thing of the

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,640
same problem and

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,480
afterwards i want to steal some of your

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,919
ideas and we should probably

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,159
solve this together um so crispy keeps

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,360
crispy forms crisper longer

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,679
um i am currently working on a very

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,159
very form heavy app it has more forms

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,360
any app i've ever worked on

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,600
it's just pages and pages of them and so

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
crispy is a django module which some of

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,279
you are very familiar with to try to

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,960
make forms a little more dry and don't

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,559
repeat yourself

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,640
so a crispy form might look like that

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,159
um and that's fine you put your stuff

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
into rows and columns and

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,559
the little bits and pieces are your um

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,640
your field names and that's great

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,159
um except of course then some designer

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,159
says that's cool but i want this

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:45,840
with columns and

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,960
um little bits and pieces broken out and

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,480
javascript connectors and

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
slide out things and attachments and

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,840
you name it they want every single part

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
of that um

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,159
and the designers want to be able to

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,760
edit the templates they don't want

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,840
that they don't understand how to

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,519
program and every time they program pep

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,679
8 blows up at them and says you did it

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,200
wrong

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,399
so i extended crispy to this thing i

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,519
called crispr

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,640
which creates code that looks

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,440
like this so you go crisper form where

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,559
form is the name of my form variable

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,640
and this is my field um

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,559
and it works out what i wanted to do

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,799
from crispr

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,080
you tell crispr things about your forms

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,919
as in

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,840
what which to use what attributes to use

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,440
and you say cool chuck it there

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
and it does the right thing and then it

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,919
even does the other right thing

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,760
where um it yells at you when you forget

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,200
to put fields in when someone extends

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,320
the model and the design hasn't been

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,919
updated

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,840
um that will start chucking warnings on

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,440
their templates

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,880
and they get logged to the console and

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,240
will also let's just start chucking in

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,919
debug mode we'll just start chucking

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,120
fields down the bottom of the page with

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,960
big red boxes around them for view to

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
fix them

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,399
what you can't obviously do yet which is

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
the idea i love is use a filter to

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,519
extend the attributes

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,840
of the field inside the template

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,159
that's pretty gorgeous i'm stealing that

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,279
um

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,600
the code isn't online yet

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:25,760
because i'm too busy um it will be

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,039
until then it's pretty straightforward

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,799
it probably doesn't even need to depend

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,480
on crispy but

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:42,399
it was a good starting point but

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:57,840
it's about that long thank you

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:57,840
thank you very much okay

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,880
first time how's that

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,840
yeah yeah i just gotta

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,039
it was but there we go all right so

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,960
that's the lightning talks and that is

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:25,840
djangocon au 2013

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,840
done and dusted so thank you very much

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,519
