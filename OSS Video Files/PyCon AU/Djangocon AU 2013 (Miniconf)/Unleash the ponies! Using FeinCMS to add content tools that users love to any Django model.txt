Site editors often struggle with editing rich content and managing variations in layout in Django admin. By rich content we mean text, images, video, tables, and so on. Trying to squeeze all this content into a single rich-text editor is like trying to jam a magical pony into a dog kennel. A better approach is to use a rich content framework like FeinCMS. FeinCMS is a sensible, flexible framework which allows rich content of any shape

Greg's a director of the interaction

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,330
consortium which is a a jenga web agency

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,950
in sydney in the past he has been a

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,320
treasure of the Sydney chapter of the

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,240
usability professionals association and

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,740
the founding president of robots and

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,809
dinosaurs which is a really cool heck

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,720
space in Sydney today is going to talk

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,420
about fine CMS tools and find CMS and

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:29,010
how to unleash the ponies me please make

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:31,470
him welcome thank you I don't know how I

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,719
feel about being the filling in a core

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,030
contributor sandwich especially when i'm

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,070
not a core contributor to anything I

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,430
didn't start myself but I'm honored to

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,620
be in such esteemed company and so

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,110
unleash the ponies this talk is about

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,780
adding rich content tools to any Django

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,510
model and my name is Greg amongst other

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,570
things I'm technical director of the IC

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,780
we builds Django sites almost always

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,359
using this framework because our clients

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,939
love it okay let's get this out the way

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,369
hands up if you say fancy honest Oh

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:13,770
awesome I can probably skip the next few

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:15,030
slides and this time last year half the

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,020
people are speaking to we're calling it

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,380
faint CMS I argue that it's fine CMS

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,830
unless you're the queen in which case

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,950
they're both pronounced the same because

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:33,150
here's your posh um okay okay so English

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:37,020
has vein reigns gain and chow mien but

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,420
only Stein and Einstein so those are

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,360
both German as is well he's not Germany

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,240
Swiss this is Matthias Heston Holtz who

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,100
is the originator of fine CMS his Swiss

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,220
speaks German so his pronunciation would

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,970
be fine CMS fine in German means fine in

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,240
English Fane sounds like false so maybe

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,430
something to be avoided anyway there we

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,070
go so what's problem does fine CMS solve

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,600
well I think as Alex was talking about

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,440
this morning the web is getting more

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,660
complex web content is in particular as

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,120
a complex thing Alex was talking about

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,750
the divide between

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,849
in-app applications on the web and sites

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,930
on the web this talk is more towards the

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:27,060
sites and content publishing end I also

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,150
AM kind of sad to see that division it

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,069
would be nice if we could too if we

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,540
could build things that help us kind of

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:41,910
keep those things more integrated but

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:45,930
anyway we have very low contrast on this

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,370
screen apologies and so when we're

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,040
talking about web content we're not just

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,480
talking about text and images we're

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,629
talking about mediate media

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,459
Interactive's and talking about the

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,870
formatting the style the design the

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,859
layout the data that gets incorporated

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,840
and all of those things need to be

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:05,700
presented in a reusable way so not only

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,459
do you need to not be putting in the

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,030
same date content in several places but

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,780
you also need to be able to reuse that

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,650
content on a variety of devices yes and

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,180
of course we have to handle

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,680
user-generated content and so as the web

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,209
is growing this becomes more and more

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,609
challenging there's more technologies

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:36,780
there's more competition for any given

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:38,760
site and what button was that ok there's

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,590
more varieties people are expecting

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,069
richer experiences I don't know if you

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,000
guys have seen the new york times

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:50,280
snowfall to me that kind of represents

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,099
where the web is it kind of epitomizes

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,400
where the web is heading for me it's

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,700
kind of I was going to show it but i

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,410
think i will leave it and but check it

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,340
out do it Google for New York Times

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,290
snowfall and it's one of those examples

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,989
where every page is a kind of unique

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,540
experience and it's a combination of

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:18,510
design meeting content meeting

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:20,639
interactivity yeah so those richer

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,229
experiences are being created with

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,419
smaller and smaller teams as these

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,530
things get commoditized so what in in

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,990
particularly the magazine and newspaper

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,849
world took

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,289
teams of specialists is now being

00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,419
condensed to the point where there's one

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,000
two three generalists having to manage

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,750
layout and style and so on and trying

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,889
not to break anything at the same time

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,569
people are getting more future savvy

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,400
about their content they want to keep it

00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,169
in this tin the proper shape where they

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,120
can repurpose it for different things

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,720
they can migrate it to a new system if

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,650
they are the needy so how do we do this

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,310
and how can my non tech users publish

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,960
flexible and unique content there's true

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,210
to the design of the site but still

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,710
we've control over the styling so it

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,930
doesn't break the design but people

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,270
still have control over how that looks

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,599
and that will work on a variety of

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,190
devices that doesn't let people that

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:16,880
doesn't make people put content in

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:19,190
several places without kind of

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,729
restricting and kind of saying you can

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,030
only do the few templates that we've

00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:28,370
imagined for you and the producers clean

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,940
aids clean and semantic HTML at the

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,669
outset it's kind of a crazy problem and

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,159
you guessed it it's what fine CMS aims

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,469
to solve does many things actually but

00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:42,349
to me the fundamental kind of dynamic is

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:44,389
that it allows you to create pages from

00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:46,310
a bunch of different content types and

00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,190
to kind of rearrange and reorder those

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,740
content types that will this is that tin

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,569
diagram form so a page is made up of a

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,430
bunch of texts and a bunch of images and

00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,960
that's in a predefined order so when you

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,229
render the page they kind of appear in

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,469
that order or it kind of processes those

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,690
content types in that order in fine CMS

00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:10,669
terms a page is a kind of document so

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:18,169
find Simmons calls it has a base model

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:20,870
and the the other side is the text to

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:23,539
images and pull quotes and kinds of

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,000
content types now fine CMS content types

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,370
are not the same as Django content types

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,099
so for the rest of this talk put Django

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,099
content types out of your mind fine CMS

00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:37,820
content types these things that they

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:40,090
appear as content on your page we've

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:45,520
taken to calling them lumps

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,520
which is a bit ugly but is sticky okay

00:06:45,610 --> 00:07:02,960
so okay let's see this in action whoops

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:07,659
maybe I'll turn off mirroring no leave

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,659
it over that's going

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,380
sway

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,629
okay so this is a site we built for the

00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:27,839
Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and

00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:30,059
it it's driven from fine CMS so

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,699
basically all of the content we see on

00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:34,979
this page is either pulled out from the

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:41,400
database so it's kind of automatic or is

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:44,789
entered as content lumps so here we've

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,009
got a slideshow that shows images from

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,960
the exhibition we've got a bit of

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,449
introductory text which can be as long

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,430
or as rich as need be there's things

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,339
like sponsors and sponsors are made up

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,639
of collections of logos very carefully

00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,439
sized and positioned there's links to

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,899
educational resources and those links to

00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:09,749
shop items so in the main those things

00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,580
are entered once so their image is a

00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:14,610
part of an image library the sponsors

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,249
are part of a kind of a sponsorship app

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,349
the shop is obviously a database that is

00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:25,830
part of their e-commerce system so um

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:28,649
the way this behaves on the backend is

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,839
when you when you install fine CMS you

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,779
get these tabs which represent the

00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:36,539
different sections of contents that you

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,909
that you want to have in your model so

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,849
this umbrella page is a standard Django

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,639
model and it just inherits from fine CMS

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,260
base which and there's a fine seam as

00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,300
admin which has the JavaScript that

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,889
makes this work so the body text

00:08:50,300 --> 00:09:01,260
probably the shop is actually most

00:08:52,889 --> 00:09:03,480
simple and so all you can put in a shop

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,550
is a fraud in the shop section is a

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,230
bunch of products so you can keep going

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,730
adding more and more product so if you

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,560
want six products you you just make six

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:19,380
of these things and then the user wall

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,260
id2 is popped up over here to choose the

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,899
just use the shop item that you want so

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,890
I can choose that one and it pops away

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:31,329
and you might be thinking that's pretty

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,369
much what Django in line admin does

00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:41,679
but when you get to more rich areas so

00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:47,860
that the main body the choice of things

00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:50,709
you can add it is a lot greater so in in

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,679
the MCA we can make a link to an event

00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,920
you can you can use one off images or

00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,509
reusable images from an image library

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,600
you can put a whole gallery in which is

00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:06,699
in turn made up of collections of images

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,040
and you can put pull quotes in you can

00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:10,989
even drop back to raw HTML if you feel

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,119
if you need a one-off piece of

00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:21,399
JavaScript for some reason M so once

00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:25,619
those are in you can rearrange the order

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:37,629
you can show and hide you can delete and

00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:39,669
so on okay so that's I guess in terms of

00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:41,439
it what happens in the database it's

00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:46,629
fairly straightforward what we were

00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:48,790
looking at in the previous slide was one

00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,769
section containing a variety of content

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,629
types so we've got you know a page with

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,089
a main section it's got some text in the

00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,739
image in a text you saw just then we had

00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:00,179
different sections so there's the shop

00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:02,819
section and things like sidebars and

00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:07,299
related items and that sort of thing

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:10,089
those are not represented in the data

00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,949
base tables the data relation is still

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,679
directly from the content type to the

00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:16,929
document so the you can actually hard

00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,369
codes the sections you just put strings

00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,049
in for the name of the sections and

00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:22,989
their strings get stored in the database

00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:25,360
and so it's a really simple data model

00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:30,910
and i'll just quickly give you a peek

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,839
into the postgres happening now I won't

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,350
get because I haven't made the

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,350
migrations

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:48,339
am i doing for time 32 okay em what I

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:51,519
plan to do was to start to show you how

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:56,399
we bring fine CMS into a new project so

00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:00,040
that you guys can try it at home and so

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,949
before I do that I want to show you the

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:09,009
way that fine CMS asks you to do things

00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:12,160
which is this sort of thing so you

00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:14,889
define your model inherits and finds

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,319
most models base you do the standard

00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:21,720
Django thing of choosing some fields and

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,720
writing your meta and so on and so on um

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,040
fine CMS has this process of creating

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,110
content types so for every content type

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,290
that you want you're supposed to call

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,029
this on your model find semester sorry

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,889
you'll find some ice Model great content

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,529
type and then go through all of your

00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,029
types are available and allocate them to

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,829
the regions that they're allowed to be

00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,819
in so I don't know about you but this

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:51,550
makes me a bit itchy and it's not very

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,959
dry it all of this stuff feels like it

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,510
should be part of the model but it's

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,139
living outside in some kind of unknown

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,339
piece of code like it's really supposed

00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:02,290
to put it just below where you define

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,760
your model but there's nothing stopping

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,240
someone else from kind of monkey

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,959
patching in a content type so it gets a

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,510
bit scary and then on a large project

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,790
where you have several such models you

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,199
want the same content types available in

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,569
all of those models you don't want to

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,010
have to repeat that whole sequence of

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:23,829
calls and make sure it's the same all

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:28,410
over your site so we made a little

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:32,500
library chords and find CMS tools and

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,990
it's a github com such i Iook see / I

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,399
think it's glam kit dash fine CMS tools

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,730
and all it is is a lightweight

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,860
wraparound fine CMS that allows you to

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,220
define what content types are available

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,430
and what what regions you want inside

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,360
your model and

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,290
so now I'm going to just with very

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,540
quickly through the how we design a an

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,970
app and for the sake of demonstration

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,790
I'm just going to make an app that is

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,230
for organizing meetups so you publish a

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,790
meetup and you want to describe what

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,560
happens maybe after that's happened you

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,080
want to upload the powerpoint templates

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:14,459
and or the video from it so talking

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,160
about rich content and the source code

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,110
for what I'm about to do is here and

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,089
I've tagged all of the stages so you can

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,800
sort of see how the progression goes

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,130
through through the through the numbers

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,940
em and I'll give you the address again

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,410
at the end hopefully I well I think I

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,100
have time to get through this but if you

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,020
have any questions now probably best to

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,440
put your hand up and interrupt me and

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,760
ask me to explain happy to do that or

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,080
wait to find find me at the end and I

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:53,790
can we can sit down and I'll show you

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:56,400
some stuff ok m ok so this is where this

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,760
is us ok I'm definitely going to turn

00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,760
off Mary

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:17,200
okay so this is our standards django

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:19,400
projects i've made our meetups

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,110
application in there and the model in

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,110
the meetup is fairly straightforward

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:35,960
just want to turn off okay em there's no

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:44,150
fine CMS in there yet it's just added to

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:46,630
the requirement so if I oops just going

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,630
to check out

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:55,100
very simple addition and so the simplest

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,600
possible way of integrating something is

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,030
you inherit from this fine CMS document

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,800
which is the fine CMS tools version of

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:10,550
the fine CMS base that starts looking

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,640
for a declaration called fine CMS

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,710
regions so we just define two regions

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,870
the main region for the main content and

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:23,330
the sidebar and then it looks for a

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,610
method called content types by region so

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:29,360
it will pass in the region name and then

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,210
it expects you to return the content

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,980
types are it available so at the moment

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,810
here is the category of content types

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:44,240
and then there is the type itself so

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:46,100
we've reduced all of that kind of kind

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,020
of lengthy listings of everything to a

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,210
single function that you can define

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,070
somewhere else and reuse in every model

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,810
right now we're using just text I'm

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:05,450
going to skip forward a bit just for

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:09,380
time and add some more models and okay

00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,839
so now I'm there there are a couple of

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,339
categories there's the default category

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,970
which has text there's a media category

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,560
which has a no embeds type so you can

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,500
just paste in a youtube video and it'll

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,230
show up with the video I've made a you

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,130
know an advanced category with raw HTML

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,410
content this mfc is a media file content

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,350
that takes parameters it comes with is

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,320
this media file then comes with fine CMS

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:41,360
and so when you when you instantiate it

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:44,060
it and you pass it these these settings

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,890
which show you how you can define your

00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:56,780
own styles for how that media contents

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:59,260
displayed m8 minutes okay I do a quick

00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,260
variation

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,409
ok

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,000
oh yeah

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,149
okay inside the database and that

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,549
migration that I just run starts

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:34,049
creating tables that look like this so

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:39,649
I've got my meetup model that I just

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:42,480
defined that has the standard Django

00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:44,519
fields in it but then for every kind of

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,820
content type that you attach to the

00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,820
meetup model there's a new table created

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:59,309
so when I when we look at the definition

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,139
of the content types we've they're

00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,779
pretty much standard Django models I

00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:06,210
should have got to this bit earlier I'm

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:10,740
defining a content type and it inherits

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:16,320
from a Content fine CMS tools content

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:18,630
sup super sub superglass content types

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,139
are all abstract models because fine CMS

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:25,139
goes and grabs make makes its own

00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:28,320
internal concrete subclass the results

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:31,260
in this database table so the additional

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,159
fields the link to the parents which is

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:38,070
there which is which is the the document

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,720
that contains the content and then the

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,370
region that it lives in so that whether

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,120
it's the main or the sidebar and that's

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,889
just a string so that so the data model

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,510
is really simple but you do end up with

00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,370
hundreds of tables so it's really

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:59,360
important to kind of get a good grip on

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:59,360
your South migrations okay

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:13,910
I want to show you one more thing which

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:17,280
is that that the network is struggling

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,070
the fine CMS content lumps don't have to

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,210
be and this is this is kind of a point

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,760
pointing towards the future a little bit

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,429
fine CMS content types don't actually

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,929
have to contain content and of course

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:29,700
they can contain foreign keys to a

00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:32,130
content elsewhere you don't have to

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,340
enter it right there and then but in

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:39,090
another side that we built which is for

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,660
IWC early in international watch company

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:46,679
that's not loading and we have fine CMS

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:50,360
region which is there and it contains

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:56,160
these there's different kinds of content

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:58,160
but it also contains this layout module

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:04,140
so it's kind of like a meta content

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:07,590
thanks Jacob that's wrong wrong size

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,380
Apple does it okay well hopefully get

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:15,660
through this in the next six minutes em

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:18,300
it contains content types that are that

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,340
don't actually render things on the page

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:26,840
but they change how other things are

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:30,990
rendered so has this page loaded no M

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:37,320
such a shame everyone stop using the

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:39,950
Internet turn off your bit times M okay

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,950
look I'm kanay

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,450
show you I guess

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:56,809
you have to imagine this tool gives when

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,179
you choose one of these options it it

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:07,159
controls the layout of the next items in

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:10,039
the list so when you choose this when

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,350
you choose this option for instance we

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:15,580
know that the the number one next

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:19,039
content is going to take up a large

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,870
column and then the two and the three

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,880
after that are going to be on top of the

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,940
other in the right hand column so what

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,950
this does is it allows people to allows

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,460
content editors to make decisions about

00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,890
the layout that won't compromise the

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,600
design so that the this choice of

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:39,710
layouts has been designed by the

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,730
designers of the site which I would love

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:48,260
to be able to show you but m and it

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,289
enforces some rules about what the

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,750
design can and can't do so what that

00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:55,730
means is that we've gone from a world

00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,020
where people are pasting in content from

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,789
words and kind of using like whatever

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,980
they can to get the layout they want or

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:05,570
maybe having to call up some developers

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,700
and go I need a new template that does

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,500
such and such a layout they've already

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:17,440
got those tools available this is a

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:22,100
really simple a kind of demonstration of

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,230
content that's not part of sorry content

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,360
there's not actually content but it's

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,110
more like meta kind of decisions that

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,649
people are making and so I guess I'm

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,940
intrigued especially given where design

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,270
on the web is going it's moving away

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:41,960
from kind of boxes and more towards

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,760
every page being unique and design kind

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,270
of matching the content rather than

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,429
having to fit into a template so this to

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,740
me feels like a signpost for where the

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:54,679
future is going that the content editors

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,960
will be able to make put signals inside

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,490
the content that indicate how it should

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,260
be displayed so I'm kind of interested

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,610
to see where this goes at the moment

00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,890
people

00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,470
who using this love it like it results

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:10,990
in far fewer technical support calls and

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:14,390
and everyone's everyone's happier um

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,040
I've got is that including questions two

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,080
minutes ready that's not including

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,330
questions okay well we might have two

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:29,480
minutes extra for questions unless I can

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:33,380
get this page to load what else do i

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,600
need to show i think it's probably a

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,640
good point to pause i think i've gone

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,360
pretty quickly so i'm happy to take some

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:48,309
of this time to go back and explain what

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,309
happened but yeah get back to me

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,620
computer fighting back today all right

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,190
unleash the questions i think thank you

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,190
so much

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:11,890
do we have any questions I have one if

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:16,160
note with the one here um thanks very

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,900
manners been just interesting tool at

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,380
the end of the day it looks like it's a

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,850
really slick way of making pages if

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:28,970
you've got a more sort of semantic

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:31,760
centric model how does find CMS does it

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:39,350
play nice with more structured data

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:41,630
models that you kind of like it does so

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,070
the document model is it it can be a

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,130
structure to see like it's a standard

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:48,770
junk Django model and the same applies

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,679
for all of the content types themselves

00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,920
they're just Django models but they have

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,260
a abstract so they finally much makes

00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,240
them concrete for every type so you can

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:05,950
structure that as much as you like and

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,950
it doesn't have to be content it can be

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,850
its kind of date that you had a database

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:19,340
call-outs we use it I don't know if this

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:21,950
is going yes question is do you have the

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,150
watches in the model that so that there

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,670
is a standard Django model that

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:29,020
describes a watch and it's got you know

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:31,520
images and the the the name of them and

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,770
the family that they live in but there's

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,630
also a rich there's a fine CMS section

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:39,770
inside that model for describing

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:44,900
whatever whatever you need to about the

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:49,100
the watch say it so the catalog page on

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,780
the watch site looks like the facts and

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,559
figures it looks much more like a

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,679
brochure than a than a product page and

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,420
but you can index it and navigate

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,900
through it as though it was a you know a

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,900
catalog

00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:10,229
okay let's run at the back

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:18,679
Thanks great talk um just in CMS's in

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,750
general hmm like that uses the Django

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,639
admin for all of its um you know editing

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,380
and stuff and I find sometimes users

00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:27,620
find that a bit of a complicated Beast

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,240
yeah um I guess WordPress is your other

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,740
extreme that's got a really nice slick

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,740
user interface but it's probably quite

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,299
hard to make things awesome hmm do you

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,049
have any thoughts on how to because

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,460
that's you know there's quite

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,529
complicated stuff going on behind the

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,299
scenes do you have any tips on how to

00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:43,340
make a complicated structure like that

00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:46,159
really really simple for our end users

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,039
to be outer I don't have a solution I

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:53,840
can tell you some of the things that we

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:56,299
do one is we use tango admin tools which

00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:03,230
is what's going on at the top here which

00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:05,629
is I guess a skin on top of Django admin

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,519
but one that also allows you to

00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,830
rearrange your content types into some

00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,330
sort of meaningful order so doesn't

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,850
necessarily have to be grouped by

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,669
application you can put models into

00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:20,389
different sections people use this menu

00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:23,029
a lot when we watch them just for kind

00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:27,769
of quickly jumping from you know one

00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:29,590
mental space to another and what one

00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:32,379
problem i would like to see solved is

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:36,529
something that other CMS is do which is

00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:39,379
give you a bit of a site you know kind

00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:41,600
of heterogeneous list of what's in your

00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:44,059
site and there is different kinds of

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,070
admin available depending on what kind

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:48,529
of content you click on rather than

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,889
having to choose the content first and

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:54,889
navigate to that content so yeah I think

00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:56,419
there is a there is a mapping disconnect

00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:58,279
between the way content editors think

00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:59,629
about things in a way database designers

00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,700
think about things Django admin

00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:04,850
obviously very much geared towards the

00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,809
latter and I'm very keen to see tools

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:12,490
that allow us to kind of describe what

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:17,049
what users are thinking about okay

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,049
