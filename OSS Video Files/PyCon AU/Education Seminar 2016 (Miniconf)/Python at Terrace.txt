The development of the Digital Technologies curriculum and the shift from ICT to DT has dramatically changed the teaching of computing in schools. This change has challenged teachers to find new solutions and software to assist them in their teaching of the curriculum. Some schools have employed Python as a way of meeting these challenges and requirements outlined in the curriculum documents.
The band description 8.6 states that  by the end of Grade Eight students should be using a general purpose language to code solutions. At Terrace we decided to use Python to achieve this outcome because of Pythonâ€™s ease of deployment, cost and syntax light approach. Students in Grade Eight use the turtle and functions to write their name and create shapes. In Grades Nine and Ten the band description states:Students develop modular solutions to complex problems using an object-oriented programming language where appropriate, and evaluate their solutions and existing information systems based on a broad set of criteria including connections to existing policies and their enterprise potential. To achieve this we get students to program classes and databases. Students create a piece of software that creates customers for a bank or a character creator for an RPG. Students design, implement and evaluate the software that they create. In this presentation I will share the successes and failures over the past five years and provide people with software options, programs of work and ideas for Grades Eight to Ten when using Python.

welcome back everyone for our final

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,230
session of the day it's my pleasure to

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,630
introduce tim stevens tim is a digital

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,759
technologies teacher at st. joseph's

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,349
college gregory terrace in Brisbane it's

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,379
been using Python in his classes for the

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,060
past five years he's an active member of

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,550
KU sites presented at the last three

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,460
state conferences and recently named q

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,630
side educated of the year for 2015 tim

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
was a member of q sites digital

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,570
champions program whose role was to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,789
provide support material for the

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,030
teaching of digital technologies thank

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:38,460
you yep thank you very much so I work at

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,390
Gregory terrace which is inner city

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,760
school in Brisbane we got 1,400 boys

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:50,059
from grade 5 through to grade 12 it's a

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,550
very academic school boys boys are very

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:56,760
motivated to get a's the scariest mark i

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,340
give us a b+ and i'll get phone calls

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,109
from parents saying please because we

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,390
have metals gold silver and bronze

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,369
medals and awards if you get to 7 a's

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,540
for the term you get a gold medal and

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,340
that sort of thing so it's full on a lot

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,770
of pressure on on staff with their

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,689
marking but I've been working there

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,299
since 1999 so it can't be too bad we've

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:24,240
had an ICT course there for over 15

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,770
years maybe longer than that which has

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,710
slowly evolved into a digital

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,380
technologies we've taken out the

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,619
PowerPoint thank God the term of

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,200
PowerPoint and put in programming and

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,750
database and that sort of stuff we also

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,409
had the pleasure of going BYOD bring

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,149
your own debacle I mean disaster no

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,520
sorry device I've got to get that right

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,579
I've got to get it right is it I always

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,890
get that wrong that's an actual well

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,600
it's almost an actual laptop that I saw

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,759
the other day but the kid was actually

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,439
holding it with his hand wasn't as

00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,640
cracked as that there was a crack in it

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,170
but he's holding the screen with his

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,159
hand and trying to program at the same

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,320
time we did the school did say just

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,160
bring whatever you want so that's

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,390
obviously had massive challenges doing

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,800
databases with grade eights this term

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,630
and trying to find

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,080
because we can't use microsoft access

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,320
and most kids do a windows boot on their

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,090
mac so he went to liberate office and

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,370
there was Java problems galore and we've

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,140
had weeks of trying to fix that so

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,640
there's some nice challenges there for

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,290
the staff and of course they gave us

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,670
plenty of professional development and

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,060
time to do that so far as my sarcasm too

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:43,250
thick there yeah okay then of course

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,080
after the ICT we evolved this came out

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,400
and the thing that interested introduced

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,050
interested this us the most that was

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,060
eight point six and ten point eight

00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,250
which is the you've got to start

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,050
programming by grade eight and you're

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,060
going to do some object orientated stuff

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,610
by grade 10 and so that's what we've

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,400
tried to do so last year was the first

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,080
time we used python in grade eight we've

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
been doing Python in grade 10 for about

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,240
five years now and I'm just going to go

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,040
through what the what we did what we did

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,760
what we've taken out what we put back in

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,650
and then took out again over those years

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,150
so really we sort of looked at that well

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,080
what are we going to do now what program

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,670
language are we going to use my subject

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,870
core no Peter White House he's been

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,480
teaching Pascal for 30-odd years but we

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,830
were looking for a different language I

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,020
had done some visual studio wait for me

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:46,080
to get into a fetal position curly

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:48,989
braces curly braces scare me through q

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,920
site they had offered a free courses

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,989
with Oracle in Java in Alice green foot

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,120
and Eclipse and that was a great course

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,989
actually o the green foots excellent

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,110
program and you can see that's the hello

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,050
world program in Eclipse so that was

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,760
sort of where I came from and then of

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,800
course I went and had a look at the

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,769
computing it's school website from

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,780
Britain and found work booklets galore

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,070
in Python because obviously they'd had

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,919
their big revolution and there'd be a

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,930
bit massive big Python push in Britain I

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,430
went to Coursera and did like an eight

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:30,840
week course with Toronto and Python

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:35,250
made me feel like that after after the

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,050
c-sharp Visual Studio debacle I felt

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,620
like I could actually do this because

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,930
i'm actually a drama teacher who failed

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,639
at drama teaching and decided to grow up

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,979
and was about 35 and realized he wanted

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
to be an IT teacher so that's when I

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,740
went back to Union did the visual studio

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,449
stuff so after doing Python I realize I

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,250
could actually program and do this stuff

00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,350
and of course it's all because of the

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,590
idol so you saw that in the vision in

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,690
the Eclipse the hello world program

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,460
where you had to go and create a claw or

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,960
a file and then a class and then there's

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,570
all this magic code and then you had to

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,889
write hello world that's what I love

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,870
about python is it's just nice and

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,009
simple and it works and for our

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,370
situation with a BYOD school it was open

00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:22,440
source it was free it's the magic word

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,150
and it works on all platforms and it

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,770
does work on all platforms and no

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,630
problems never had a problem installing

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,650
Python which was for us a godsend with

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:37,580
us some of the other problems that we've

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:40,229
had so five and six no lessons they have

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,270
after exam period when they've got some

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,409
dead time that elearning coordinator

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,539
goes in and does an hour and a half

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,979
double lesson with them and they do some

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,080
hour of code they didn't doing some

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,849
scratch junior we had iPads they've

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,940
gotten rid of iPads now they've got

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:57,300
microsoft surface Pro's instead i don't

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,130
know why but they did that the teachers

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,419
are just they've had iPads for three

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,449
years I'll let's throw that out the door

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,090
and let's get something new in so we did

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,970
all that they do that 78 is compulsory

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,409
it's a year-long course that's only the

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,020
programming stuff we do a Hollywood

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:18,210
database sort of stuff to databases and

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,669
a lot of spread shooting that sort of

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,490
thing so visualizing data manipulating

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:27,690
data we've got a course called big data

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,520
the grade eight scratch an app inventor

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,610
in grade seven so the grade sevens right

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,440
now are creating a study app for maths

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,389
or for science there's their assignment

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,669
this term game maker which I'm starting

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,349
to lose

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:46,139
lose a bit of faith in it's just again

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:48,810
there's some issues with mac and pc and

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,750
not using microsoft's the GameMaker

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,879
studio but we use 88 or used to use five

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,159
at one stage and just make them or use

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,870
five that's also for cheating and

00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,610
stealing off the internet and that sort

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,970
of stuff and then last year for the

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,680
first time we did Python in grade eight

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,300
you know I still got some of that ICT

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,030
stuff we do flash and dreamweaver with

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,909
them but app inventor is what we the

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,909
main programming thing we do in grade 9

00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,860
semester of Python in term one and two

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,050
and year 10 so basically the idea was

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,000
they learn software in semester 1 and

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,520
then we do hardware and semester 2 so we

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,130
do robotics and arduino xin in term two

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,330
that was the thought I also wear a

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,960
google apps for education I did a

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,180
professional development a couple of

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,740
weeks ago with the Holly of education

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,780
queensland teachers and i don't know how

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,889
they teach without google they can't the

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,830
only thing they can get to his google

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:42,870
search where I just love Google

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,280
classroom that's just there if you

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,020
haven't heard of it go and have a look

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,319
at it and carried your school to get it

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,880
for me we got a Moodle as well but day

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,370
to day teaching and classroom stuff

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,090
Google classroom is just fantastic I

00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:01,110
love it so great a turtle graphics

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,460
that's what we start with so we might

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,960
start with little activity like this for

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,789
the actual on pen and paper they've got

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,240
to draw a square and they've got a lot

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:12,599
list down the steps of that and then we

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,120
sort of try and those steps we then

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,740
transfer over into the syntax so getting

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,169
your pencil case and getting a pen out

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,520
is like importing the turtle library

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,050
we've got to go this whole libraries got

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,569
a holly / things in there and we're

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,240
going to go and get a pencil out of it

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:30,060
that sort of thing so very basic sort of

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,229
syntax one of the first activities we do

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,669
is get them to draw the olympic circles

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,320
that one then we might move into

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,110
actually creating a function called

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,760
circle and getting the circle going to

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,320
then call that each time that they get

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,630
to the right position change the color

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,170
and then call the circle program so we

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:52,709
start to get him using functions as well

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,870
and this is the assignment so the

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,240
assignment is to draw

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,860
name not using the text feature because

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,170
there is a feature can get a turtle to

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:05,089
draw text as some of the you rates found

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:08,870
out well done but no there are at least

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,000
right for words four letters sorry

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,210
they've got to do a repeating shape of

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,190
some sort and a personal logo and what I

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,200
like about this is when they write the

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,390
function teeth to write the tea and they

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,900
call it down here I know that probably

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,520
sounds ridiculous but it actually the

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,760
kids really see that that's a funk

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,260
that's a call to that function up there

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,120
that sort of thing makes it clear for

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,190
them so basically we get I actually

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,520
right we're getting the basic sort of

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,810
shell of the functions and the calls to

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,350
those functions and then it's go go and

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,240
fill that in with the actual programming

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,240
so that's the sort of thing we do for

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,600
loops functions and that's about where

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,120
we got to the best assignment I had last

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,300
year when I opened it up all of a sudden

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,589
a web page opened to youtube and has

00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,140
started playing the game of Thrones

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,970
theme then the window I appeared and

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,800
then he started drawing and his actual

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,779
shape was the whole background as well

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,660
and it went on for about 10 minutes it

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,010
was fantastic so and I never taught them

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,390
how to do what actually went oh god how

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,500
you do that get the webpage open I

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:19,610
didn't know you could do that so grade

00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,339
nines we do app inventor and sort of

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,360
after listen to dr. zagami one time at

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,070
the last stake conference their

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,850
assignment is trying to make an app that

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,470
changes the world so an idea was that my

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,670
daughter's got asthma and I was at the

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,529
doctors the other days she gave me this

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,510
sheet where she's gotta fill in how many

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:40,790
times she's often this sort of thing

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,580
into overthrew that's what I do for a

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,830
nap so that sort of thing and apt to

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,250
change the world but what they do this

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,390
is a magic 8-ball program so we do this

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:56,230
this term in term three then in term one

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:59,959
they actually program the same sort of

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,730
programs in Python so in App Inventor

00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,320
we've already done magic 8-ball we're

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,750
done a guessing game we did a username

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,370
password so they've got the basic sort

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,240
of algorithm and shape of what the

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,220
should do so turn one in grade 10 and

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,260
this will probably change a bit because

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,960
as I said last year was the first time

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,140
the Year eights had done some basic

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,700
Python the great ends this year hadn't

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,790
touched pison until this year so we

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,230
might have to bump this up a little bit

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,860
but that's just a basic introduction to

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,779
all lists and while loops and all that

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,520
sort of stuff but they're the sort of

00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,150
programs that we get them to do little

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,700
challenges each lesson to do and then

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,589
they have an exam as I said kids love

00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,600
getting A's and they want to get an

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,160
a-plus so one way to and also we have a

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,720
lot of assignments and we just wanted to

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,880
break those assignments up and give them

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,010
an exam so that's like one of the

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,690
questions obviously the first five or

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,940
six questions is you know what data type

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,360
is this what's the output of this thing

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,890
you know that sort of stuff and then

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,620
they've got to write and this is a hand

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:09,230
written exam they're going to write a

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,520
program that that works out how many

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,010
tickets you've bought and out what the

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,380
cost is and to give some change back and

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,640
that sort of stuff and that worked

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,290
really well that was the first time we

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,940
we had done that usually we did two

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,310
assignments but we actually found that

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,300
the especially when the spread and

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,589
you're trying to get a ducks and what

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,260
sort of stuff it actually helped us a

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,330
lot kids kids thought they knew how to

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,300
program until they did the exam and then

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,230
had to do some work next term so the

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:41,660
next term we move on to classes and this

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:43,520
is my harry potter example and so remove

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,560
that object orientated sort of stuff now

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,570
so they've got to create a constructor

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,160
method the constructor method and then a

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,130
hollywood other methods to do the wand

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,010
and what sort of Petronius you've gotten

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,100
that sort of stuff stuff and that's

00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,250
linked then to a database so once you've

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,270
created the instance of you're a wizard

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,250
then you've got to be able to store that

00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,600
in a database and then be able to query

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,339
that database and get that information

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,560
out again all of that is in the idle we

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,150
just use the idol we don't use any

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,089
graphical sort of stuff and I'll talk a

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,010
bit about that a bit later but that was

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,139
a choice that we've made so it is a bit

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,689
of SQL so they have done in gray

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,220
nine new databases and we do SQL stuff

00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:28,189
so hopefully they've already got that

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,970
prior knowledge it's really just then

00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:36,429
how you access that database using

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:39,679
Python which is so easy really so simple

00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:44,749
so their assessment their assignment is

00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:47,959
to create a class and database system

00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:51,160
and the Harry Potter example create an

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,160
instance of wizard with six attributes

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:55,399
then the other examples they can do bank

00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,169
customers school database none of the

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,790
kids did any of those they came up with

00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,189
their own they were boring there was

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,929
like Star Wars characters and then one

00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:04,369
kid wait and got all the ASCII art for

00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,439
all the weapons in Star Wars or

00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:08,299
something so you bought a weapon and

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,309
then slowly it would build the weapon

00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,699
the ASCII art in front of you it was

00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:16,730
quite good and if they wanted to the

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,980
real challenge was the dueling stuff and

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,399
the role playing game being able to

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,589
choose a wizard have choose two wizards

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,019
make them jewel have some health and

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,879
hits and all that sort of stuff that was

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,619
the real channel on a clean of them

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,970
really got to that level at all but at

00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,059
least set that challenge there so that

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,600
they've got something to to reach for

00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:41,179
and it's all in the idol so that's the

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,709
sort of example of you know Phil welcome

00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:45,499
to the Wizarding World what do you want

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:48,499
to do go get your wand and then it

00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:50,360
prints out from the database what your

00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:53,569
your wizard has and all the attributes

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,790
of your wizard and of course the do you

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:56,839
want to save this yes no once you've

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,040
made the wizard then you've got to

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,209
choose whether you want to save it and

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,129
then it goes and saves it into the

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,239
database and tells you that you've saved

00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:05,289
it so there's all that interaction

00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:08,150
design there but just through the idle

00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:11,030
TK inter

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,400
this is what we used to do and what we

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,410
felt we had it in there and we took it

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,910
out and then the next year we will

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,310
forgot why we took it out so we put it

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,470
back in and then we went our that's why

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,230
we took it out that's right because they

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,640
write a really nice program and got it

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,170
working and then they sort of because

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,270
it's event-driven sort of stuff and they

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,950
had to pull it apart and rip it apart to

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,280
actually make it work fit it into this

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,470
and we thought is it just I candy is it

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,690
just making it look better than the idol

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,460
are they actually learning to program so

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,740
is it better just to stick with the idol

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,560
and get the programming right then

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,170
actually go into this and we only did a

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,880
lot of that as well and the other

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,560
problem is as I said before the kids

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,660
want to get aids they go to the Internet

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,340
and they'd steal how to do a drop down

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,570
cascading menu and going under these

00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,940
other things and then something would

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,160
break in it and then they'd say sir fix

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:05,570
it and I go I have no idea to fix that

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,280
so you know that was a problem as well

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,120
though so then we went that's right

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,480
we're going to take it out we're going

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,250
to abandon it never use it again unless

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,140
we can get a better system and I said

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:19,130
Peter used to do delfy programming and

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,750
and or Pascal program with Delphie and

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,790
it's just used that interface and the

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,860
form and if Python had something like

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,840
that we'd probably bring it back where

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,310
you could just drag a button on or you

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,070
could drag a form on that sort of thing

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,080
that's really what he's looking for just

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,950
to take must make it easy we don't wanna

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:42,760
make it difficult for them pygame and pi

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:45,140
0 that's my experience so after about

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,870
nine months of trying to install it on

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,820
my computer because the installation

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,620
instructions are like only about six

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,180
lines but there's a couple of really

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,520
important steps they're like going to

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,010
this folder that's not there which I

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,620
didn't know then I went I finally

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,050
working yes import pygame it works then

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,810
I tried to do the first tutorial of this

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,370
car moving around and then it kept

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,280
saying that it couldn't find the picture

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,050
even though the pictures in the same

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,410
folder and everything and I'm just lost

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:18,320
it and did that and said I've come back

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,870
to that another time when I'm calm what

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,980
I need is a professional development of

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,179
workshop or something where

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,290
when guys this is how you fix it because

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,079
I think there's probably just a little

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,480
hurdle there that I once i get through

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:34,700
that then I'll be fine it's just that I

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,700
haven't got the time to that yeah so the

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,010
challenges when I first started doing it

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,309
obviously being new to it was trying to

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,799
debug code that was in kids go what you

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,010
don't know what's wrong with it kids

00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:51,049
also just not reading the error message

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,160
that clearly says you know what would I

00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,980
want to read the error message sir

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,880
that's what you thought come and fix it

00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:02,690
you know but using the rubber duck

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,730
debugging and asking the kids this what

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,429
Peter White has with all his wisdom said

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,620
just ask the kid till tell him to tell

00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:12,410
you what he wants to do and by the time

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,210
they've explained what they want to do

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,210
nine times out of ten they've actually

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,530
solved the problem themselves so that

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:26,090
was a big help code help from the

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:29,450
internet thats really comes down to me

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,760
checking kids work regularly and seeing

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,110
updates that quite little kid who sits

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,330
there for three weeks and does nothing

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,080
and then all of a sudden there's this

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,970
brilliant assignment Wow so I if that

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,040
happens and I tell the kids open i said

00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,900
i will sit you down and we will go

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,570
through the assignment line by line and

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,580
you'll need to explain to me what each

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,059
line of code does and if you can't do

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,200
that then don't use it if you want to go

00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,299
and get some help from the internet

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,059
that's fine as long as you can explain

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,730
the code so don't use any code that you

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:06,049
can't explain but what does help is the

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:09,410
kid who goes and steals a 2.7 file who

00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,940
swears to god hand on Bible I have been

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,320
checking this all term so it's been

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,940
working fine in my 3.5 and you go no it

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,040
hasn't it's never worked there's a raw

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,220
input there that's not going to work in

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,600
3.5 so that's actually a big help kids

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,520
don't know about that a lot of the kids

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,740
don't know about that that there is

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,170
actual syntax difference and I don't

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,790
tell them about it

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,330
I actually didn't know there was a

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,830
difference until I think it was last his

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,800
bike conference really that really came

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,880
out but I mean before that we just you

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,170
know I always went in looked downloaded

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,620
the latest version of it I didn't know

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,300
that there was a thing with those two

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,900
different concepts so but the other

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,640
thing is to get an a does your code have

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,870
to be elegant and beautiful or to just

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,160
have to be functional so that's

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,360
something else that we worked out as

00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,030
well can a kid who writes 15 lines of

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,370
code still get an a the kid who wrote

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,080
three lines of code of course there's

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,820
some things like we need you need to use

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,110
a for loop if it's obvious that he needs

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,750
to use a for loop that sort of thing

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,280
then maybe that needs to be marked down

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,760
so how do we mark is how do we assess

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,150
this code and i'll be really expecting

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,430
them to get beautiful elegant code by

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:25,690
the end of grade 10 probably not but

00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:27,610
both eights and tens wow the stuff that

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,990
they've been doing and because their

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,730
kids they've got the time to spend eight

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,090
hours on an assignment and work there

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,910
and get some stuff done just being blown

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,980
away really have I my last year's my

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,230
last year's year tens they were just

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,000
brilliant you would just you would give

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,590
them an idea and by the time I finished

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,880
explaining it they'd already have a

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:51,040
solution and fixed it and made it better

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,960
and but there's some years where I put

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,120
an activity up like the magic eight ball

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,200
and kids just look at you with a blank

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,940
face and just go what do I do now but by

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,110
a really great class last year and

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,760
obviously that happens every now and

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,960
then and there some really great program

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:11,170
is there pycharm and the the the thing i

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,930
love about python is the idol so i don't

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,400
see the need of using this and that was

00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,530
half the problem why I couldn't code

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,480
within the c-sharp is because I was

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,630
having problems with microsemi

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,130
christoffel studio visual studio it

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,300
wasn't actually the programming concepts

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,060
I was having problems and is actually

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,950
trying to get the idea idea be working

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,350
properly so that's where I actually

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:36,460
don't want to use that maybe if we start

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:38,110
doing stuff in flask or something like

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,820
that or Django whatever we might need to

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,070
do that sort of thing but at the moment

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,940
we're keeping it simple everything's

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,400
simple getting rid of

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:52,240
the interface stuff and just making it

00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,350
nice and simple raspberry PI's are

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,020
probably gonna get rid of all this now

00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,150
that I heard about the microbeads we

00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,830
probably won't do this problem being is

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,350
that we went BYOD we've got no monitors

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,110
at school anymore so you know I we

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,570
bought 10 raspberry PI's and I had to

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,120
before they threw out all the monitors I

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,650
went and grabbed about 15 of them just

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,260
on the off chance that we might use them

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,880
I did buy one of these or the school

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,520
bought two of these actually the pie top

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,380
the laptop where you actually build it

00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,200
yourself and put your Raspberry Pi in

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,070
there that's made life a lot easier but

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,570
you know they're four hundred dollars

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:30,490
each so we've got nine classes you just

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,280
can't buy that sort of stuff for nine

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,560
classes so whereas that micro bed and

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,540
what we want to do with the programming

00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,880
I think we can do that do something a

00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,010
bit better so that raspberry pi is still

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,980
probably ongoing program I do that with

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:49,540
the code club on a wednesday afternoon

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:52,570
we've had some fun with that q site it's

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:57,040
been a great help two weeks ago I did

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:59,080
some professional development after a

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,060
chin one day and then Python the next

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,860
day with me I'm just trying to get the

00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,200
word out there this is a great thing to

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,940
use for teachers and I think that's for

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,830
me that's why I use pipe it is it's

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,780
great for learning great for teachers

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,880
great for schools because of all those

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,440
things I said before just it's free it's

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,530
easy it works it's simple love it so you

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,270
know being a member of your professional

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:36,220
group is so important you get so much

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:39,450
help from them and that's it from me so

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,140
folks have any questions yes

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:46,150
whoa it died thinking I wanna pounce on

00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,710
one throwaway line you tossed in there

00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,559
earlier which was that it year eight you

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,130
have a big data course dying to know

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,010
what's in that uh okay if I could get to

00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:01,570
the internet like top of the hell you

00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,460
roughly names of course anything let me

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,980
just get some right so I use a lot of

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,380
google sites and that sort of stuff so I

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,710
have a course site for every single

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,730
thing that I do because I just love the

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:20,380
google stuff yeah I don't whatever me so

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:22,780
big data you're right you're right the

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:28,419
year 71 is spread sheeting and it's a

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,950
shop so they've got to create a we call

00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:32,980
that the first killer app so the first

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,630
killer app was busy Cal so that's what's

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,039
all the Hollywood Apple to know sort of

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,830
stuff so we go from that sort of point

00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,980
of view and they've got to create their

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,020
assignment actually the ice cream ones

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,360
the example it would be better I go to

00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,820
the ice cream one it's a shop management

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,530
system so the user comes in and selects

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,070
what sort of flavor ice cream and stuff

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:57,220
they want and they have to then create

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:59,440
like 10 orders and put some data in and

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,030
then create a manager's ledger which

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,590
tallies up all the data and that sort of

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,360
stuff so it's visualizing data and

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,700
that's all sheets and that's Google

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,159
sheets that's using if count if can

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,159
choose something else there the year

00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,890
eight course you're right course big

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,380
data we modified this a bit we used to

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,500
use google forms and we used to get data

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:23,409
about 13 year old boys from the census

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,390
about you know that were amazed at only

00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:28,179
two percent of Australian boys played

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,460
rugby whereas a lot of play AFL and

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,390
rugby league and stuff and then they had

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,039
to go on using a Google Form do a census

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,350
of all the terrace boys and they have to

00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,280
compare the data using premium charts

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,299
and that sort of stuff really cool so

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,890
that's what we did back we got rid of

00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,169
the form stuff because the for making

00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,850
the form is easy when you fill it out it

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,559
go straight to a spreadsheet it's just

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,290
absolutely brilliant it's just trying to

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,300
get the boys to fill in the fall

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,180
it was just driving us nuts we just

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,050
couldn't get enough data yeah so we got

00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,970
rid of that we're just going to give

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,850
them given the data and just comparing

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,350
two sets of data so that's the big data

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,870
course and we just go through what big

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,690
data is and storage and and all that

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,880
sort of stuff and it's a lot of spread

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,620
shooting as well again and that's

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,410
because one day I went I had an exam

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,210
supervision of a year 10 accounting exam

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,680
and there was a boy there with a

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,140
computer with a spreadsheet in front of

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,880
him and a calculator and he was

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,000
calculating things and then putting it

00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,460
into the spreadsheet what are you doing

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,320
i started making fun of him and then i

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,530
realized i had taught him in grade 8 and

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,250
for him toward him spreadsheet are you

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,480
not using this bridge that's for he said

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,240
that's the way we were taught to do it

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,210
so I just went ok not do is not gone

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,770
knee but you that's all the data stuff

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,900
that we don't let me do databases in

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,970
grade 8 as well yeah so the LibreOffice

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,580
stuff but making sense of big data

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,900
that's really cool yeah and there's a

00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:00,210
lot of if anyone wants a cool video

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,330
YouTube nuttin low from google you ever

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,980
seen that channel natin low they work at

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,470
Google and it's called their twenty

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,030
percent project and what they can do is

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,560
twenty percent of their time they can do

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,720
whatever they want at Google and they

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,610
make a little video channel and they go

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,960
around to all the Google's different

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,430
departments and show us what they're

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,000
doing and there's some really great

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,580
videos they're like about phones there

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,450
anzio latest phone and data on ways

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:29,370
there's a new map app called ways which

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,900
is like a game so your level when your

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,430
risk when you respond to like traffic

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,170
you're driving along and there's a

00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,120
accident and you put in that there's an

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,220
accident you get points and when you get

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,650
points more points you get you can

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,150
change a little icon so it's just

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,070
brilliant a brilliant elapsed 0 nat and

00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,050
lows twenty percent project it's a great

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,300
little four minute videos that you can

00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:54,810
show it's the start of a lesson about

00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:58,740
certain topics and stuff yeah yeah yeah

00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:00,060
but i do have a website here that that's

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,860
all the tell because we're at Google

00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,290
Apps for Education that's all inside our

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,620
Tereshkova terrace email to see it but

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,380
if I go to my other one

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:13,030
there i do have python at terrace

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:15,970
website okay we'll turn off the

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:19,390
notifications and that's an overview of

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:22,570
our course from grades 7 through to

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,860
grade 10 and there is some things like

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,640
there's the assignment you want to grab

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,780
that i'm updating that as i go along but

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,640
that's a sort of stuff the only thing

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,650
we're going to do is the grade 9 stuff

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,120
that's that's still ICT like flash

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,460
animations and stuff probably need to do

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,080
some action script but it's this more

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,730
language is going to learn we don't know

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,340
what to do with that I'm thing at unity

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,170
maybe who used to do Unreal Engine we

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,630
used to develop areas in Unreal Engine

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,830
and stuff and we might go back to their

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:55,420
we're not sure you will see how it goes

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:59,050
do we have any other questions we know

00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:03,370
what's going to go in so that's in year

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:05,260
10 so what we're going to do all our NXT

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,330
robots are falling to bits and stuff and

00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,590
we're not going to buy the ev3 because

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,570
they're way too expensive and we don't

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,500
like the programming language anyway so

00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,140
we're probably going to get something

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,760
for the Arduino so we've sourced all the

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,500
bits and we can probably buy one for

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,450
about eighty dollars all the bits rather

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:23,140
than the four hundred five hundred

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,330
dollars for the Lego one and that'll

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,130
probably switch that around and do i do

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,140
i knows first and then do robotics with

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,150
the Arduino is in the second and seconds

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,030
half but term three used to be a problem

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,870
because we have camps in terms free and

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,760
then also we have a thing called

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,920
immersion where the tens go and do

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,630
something for three weeks so we usually

00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,030
only had about four or five weeks of

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:46,929
actual teaching time so that's an actual

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,130
robotics exam so here's some code what

00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:50,230
does it do that so it's more about

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,450
automation as well so we talk a lot

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,670
about Google cars we watch a very

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,760
depressing video called humans need not

00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,500
apply it's about I watched it on a

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,970
Monday morning it was like the first

00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,010
lesson on a Monday morning they're all

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,200
just dying so and in the back of the

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,280
room there was like job guides because

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,020
they're in year ten they're doing all

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,640
the career stuff so I picked one of

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,710
their mom just went to a random page and

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,720
weren't yeah that's gone that's for

00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,130
it'll all be automated like the

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,010
transport industry and I sort of stuff

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,169
forget about it so that's yeah it's more

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:25,360
about how the hell robotics is going to

00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:28,440
a change society yes okay that's time so

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,440
