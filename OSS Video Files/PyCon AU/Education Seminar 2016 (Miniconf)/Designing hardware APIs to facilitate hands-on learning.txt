Title: Designing hardware APIs to facilitate hands-on learning
Publication date: 2016-08-16
Playlist: Education Seminar 2016 (Miniconf)
Description: 
	Andreas Antoniades
https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/172/view_talk
Through experimentation with educational hardware and software, Obelisk Systems has identified the need for, and developed a brand new framework to allow students (both university and high-school) fluid interaction with complex hardware within classrooms. This framework is further implemented into an API that handles all low-level sensor access whilst maintaining relevance to a wide variety of students.
This API will be used to interface with space experimentation and education hardware being developed by Obelisk Systems.

okay so for our last talk today I'm

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,649
happy to welcome andreas antonio des is

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,139
the managing director of obelus systems

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,030
an australian embedded aerospace and

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:16,170
electrical engineering firm located in

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,420
the Hunter Valley and he's here as a

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,250
bola systems is dedicated to providing

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,769
hardware platforms that not only

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,180
facilitate easier access to space but

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,150
also address the growing need for STEM

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,710
education recently a bubbler systems has

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,599
engaged in several educational hardware

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,070
projects one of which is powering the

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,390
first Australian startup mission to the

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:42,210
ISS Thank You Andres okay thanks for

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,920
having me yes so my talk today is called

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,530
designing hardware ap is to facilitate

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,360
hands-on learning however I think a

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,010
better title for it is probably making

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,629
Hardware cool for kids the story of a

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,370
space that because it's a little bit

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,850
more casual than what the original title

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,230
was you know supposed to be so yeah and

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,300
also thank you very much for giving me

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,980
the opportunity to talk it's it's

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,840
awesome to be able to come and be part

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,750
of such a fantastic community of

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,130
programmers and teachers and yeah just

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,540
to do our thing so firstly regarding the

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,010
whole Internet's thing if you want to

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,979
like follow us for and what we're up to

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,490
these are normal stuff I'm on the park

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,130
on slack as well as Andreas and yeah as

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,530
we said my company is oblah systems

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,390
we're about six or seven months old and

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,310
we've done some pretty pretty awesome

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,860
stuff so far with some satellite gear

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,310
and some education hardware I'll get

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,070
into that real soon a bit of a summary

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,140
of who we are we're no VOC ashtray an

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,490
aerospace company it's weird saying that

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,710
because I wouldn't have thought that was

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,579
possible a couple of years ago we're a

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,700
bunch of University of Newcastle

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,740
graduates we build and design satellite

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,680
components University equipment

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,729
diagnostic and learning tools

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,149
educational hardware systems which we'll

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,920
talk about as well and yes as we said we

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,049
with people who send stuff in a space

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,890
it's it's what we're about what we love

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,420
doing who is the team who are we well

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,950
it's myself Luke Levi and Lewis Lewis is

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,860
also here today so he's going to

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,420
probably try and answer

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,800
a couple of questions that I can if

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,030
possible right so that's us

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,910
why are we doing what we're doing what's

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,740
our jam well like I think when it comes

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,380
to satellite technology it's all about

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,790
for us it's all about cost production so

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,410
typically your satellite systems that

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,870
are really really expensive so we're

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,150
going really cheap miniature satellites

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,130
cube sets I don't know anyone heard of

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,360
cube sets before tiny little ones

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,440
they're about this big actually they're

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,610
exactly that big and yeah we're all

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,560
about making those really really

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,750
affordable to help facilitate getting

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,240
people into space doing science

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,230
experimentation and also having them so

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,180
cheap that you can put them into

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,650
universities and schools and actually

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,330
have schools playing with aerospace

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,720
hardware and programming a little

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,190
miniature satellites as part of that we

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,230
really want to help improve technologies

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,120
we're not just making it affordable by

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,850
skimping out on what's in the thing

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,070
we're going for cutting-edge stuff and

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,770
by doing that we really want to help you

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,620
know get technology as a whole

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,019
progressed because when you do that you

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,519
typically see a lot of really cool

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,049
things coming back from the aerospace

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,690
programs and I'll talk a bit more about

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,570
in a little while and of course

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,269
education it's a huge part of what we do

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,100
I founded the company on the foundation

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,080
of an affordable affordable satellite

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,760
platform that could be used in

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,980
universities and schools around the

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,320
world to teach space science and it was

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,070
my honors thesis but yeah I'll talk more

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,959
about yeah about that music so where did

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,880
it begin well it began with a project

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,209
called the proto set and that was my

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,640
crazy crazy idea I thought okay let's

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,670
make a let's make a cube set for under a

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,459
thousand dollars and is it possible to

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,100
be done I didn't want university

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,630
students to be purchasing a hundred and

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
a hundred two hundred and fifty thousand

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,330
dollars worth of satellite hardware only

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,280
for one university students say what

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,780
does it do blow it up because that

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
happens a lot happens a lot like when

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,040
you see like kids with Arduinos kids

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,140
with other raspberry pies like you're

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,700
gonna poke at it and the blue magic

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,440
smoke once it comes out of a chip you

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,820
can't put it back in again and we know

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,760
that's what make chips work right so

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,380
anyway and I was a bit rebellious as

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,570
like well if this guys doing it for 100k

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,000
I think I can beat them

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,950
and so I've got about halfway through

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,590
the satellite design actually came up

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,720
with power supply and telecommunications

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,150
modules and I thought hey actually let's

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,980
transform this into a bit of a venture

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,090
let's actually make this into a company

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,320
because I think this has got some

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,820
potential so this is some of the stuff

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,680
that we've made just there's a bit of a

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,260
background so power supply for a

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,850
miniature satellite telecommunications

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,970
platform now this is an onboard computer

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,310
onboard computer itself is actually just

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,570
come back from prototyping yesterday so

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,730
we're going to be fiddling with that and

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,050
hopefully gnome blew smoke from that

00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,000
either

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,960
and the cool thing is about it about

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,450
this is it's probably about 30 to 40

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,090
times more powerful as something about

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,110
this big than the atmospherics

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,510
processors that currently exist on the

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,970
international space station and it's you

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,880
know for a development version next to

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,350
no next to no money at all so what do

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,400
they look like little satellites they

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:31,760
look like this yeah exactly this size so

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,570
if you can picture this they come in

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,820
multiple the multiple versions so you 1u

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,110
which is 10 by 10 by 10 and then you can

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,780
have 2 u 3 u 6 u 9 u whatever there's

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,310
many different combinations and what

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,900
often happens is they get sent to the

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,670
International Space Station and then

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,310
there's this shotgun mechanism is good

00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,860
just fires them out and they fly off and

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,630
they do science yeah it's a big street

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,760
it's a big spring-loaded mechanism and

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,830
there's a get shot out at high speed and

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,240
then these things power up deploy their

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,790
antennas and do all sorts of really

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,400
fantastic science for like I said a very

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,430
very small amount of money versus the

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,900
big stuff that NASA and ESA and SpaceX

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,280
are spending you're sending up there

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,100
like your big commercial satellites are

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,490
the multiple billions of dollars anyway

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:23,240
so they do it they've grown up no

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,820
problem happy happy why do we do what we

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,800
do at all the systems well simply put we

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,140
do for a better tomorrow and that is

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,990
yeah again why we focus so much on the

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,600
education aspects if we can make this

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,400
stuff available to everyone it means we

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,260
can move forward technologically like

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,219
when it comes to the a lot of the

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,069
advanced

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,229
consumer technologies that you're using

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,559
today in this room a lot of them

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:52,129
actually came from a lot of your space

00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:54,949
program missions GPS your mobile phone

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:58,369
communications television advanced

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,839
refrigeration systems mattresses like

00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,580
there's a lot of things like that that

00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,439
have that we have to thank to the space

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,509
program and the more people that get

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,849
involved with the space program and and

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,889
space exploration a lot more funnels

00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:12,199
back down to us as a people and it just

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,749
makes life easier for everyone and also

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,759
one of the big ones is it's our nature

00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:18,409
doing space things is really our only

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,209
chance of survival like we need an

00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,069
insurance policy and that's not to be

00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:25,519
here anymore on earth but to kind of go

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,559
other places too anyway so we've got

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,839
CubeSat hardware and we really wanted to

00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:33,740
program these things and we're only

00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:36,439
wanted to you know make them like from a

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,059
software perspective not crippling the

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,349
potential within a classroom or

00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:40,819
university

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:42,919
we just wanted people to get in there

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,689
and just get science done because that's

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,099
what it's all about just finding out

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,369
about how the world works how space

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:52,669
works so we thought to herself right we

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:54,110
need a programming language that we can

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:58,039
interrogate the system as fast as

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,809
possible and like Shore embedded C which

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,509
is typically used is always going to be

00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:05,779
key but interpreting that in a fast way

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,979
you know would be fantastic and but we

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,599
we didn't really want to do that because

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,469
it's really complicated and the thing is

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,329
if we're gonna have this gear in

00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:13,519
universities in schools it's going to be

00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:17,479
pretty simple out of box so naturally

00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:21,469
what was the answer yeah yeah yeah it

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,399
was quite big respect and yeah of course

00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,610
that's why I'm here to talk to you today

00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,860
so why did we choose Python as something

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,899
to use within satellite hardware I mean

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,309
that's a pretty crazy concept right well

00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:33,649
the thing is is that as it turns out

00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,630
it's got very very simple syntax it's

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,329
relatively great at interfacing with

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,370
hardware and it's stable without slowing

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:42,680
down too much and for scientists and

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,470
engineers that's fantastic

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,509
people typically think that embedded C's

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,220
like the King like you can't beat it you

00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:51,230
know but that's not good not the case I

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,600
mean we've seen with with micro Python

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,590
even today

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,390
that you can do some pretty phenomenal

00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,530
things and the thing is is that

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,070
microcontrollers are able to do these

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,900
things with Python second thing Oh so

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,400
third thing it's a top five programming

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,990
language that's huge

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,150
familiarity around the world and

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,610
adoption is really really important for

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:17,130
people just getting in there and playing

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,840
with it and honestly if you have a

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,910
question with Python you just go to

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,950
Google there's 99 percent of the time

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,990
there's an answer for the problem that

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,580
you're having which is great you can't

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,020
do that with a few others a few other

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,490
languages and you're embedded

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,470
programming languages are typically a

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,760
little bit more challenging and also

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,980
it's highly stem applicable like

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,450
education packages and libraries exist

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,400
straight out of the bottom you know box

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,430
to help with maths graphing and more and

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,590
I think today as far as this stream goes

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,960
I've seen so many different awesome

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,850
libraries for education that yeah I

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,540
don't even need to mention any so yeah

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,800
and right and on that note yes it works

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,410
with that satellite hardware and that

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,110
was a big king so the cool thing is we

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,110
can easily talk to these systems from

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,250
desktops or anything that can run Python

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,310
and I'll talk more on that real soon

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,260
okay so maybe god this is what the cool

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,370
stuff is about we had an idea we did all

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,300
this tomorrow right okay

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,070
so how about if kids could run code in

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,070
space and you've probably heard about

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,000
this concept before and it's it's

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,860
something that's going to happen real

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,510
soon but I mean the thing is with an

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,760
aerospace company making some serious

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,250
gear let's make some more gear to

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,920
facilitate learning so you know we've

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,620
got to make this hardware to help run

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,520
Python actually a CubeSat component we

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,960
want to make it something that actually

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,270
clips onto a satellite a real

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,030
functioning satellite it lets kids in

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,630
classrooms play with real satellite

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,950
hardware and then it's got a lot of a

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,480
lot of sensors on it that they can

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,160
actually do scientific experiments with

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,920
and they can do it in a classroom and

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,110
then translate that into orbit or into a

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,930
space station so they learn how to

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,280
program and how to talk to these sensors

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,930
they come up with a hypothesis they test

00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,210
that hypothesis by writing code that's

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,850
the thing and then the idea was you'd

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:06,960
have a master unit that gets blasted to

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,950
space and runs and that is where we

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,380
went from that so we started developing

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,660
the hardware and eventually we ended up

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,970
with something that we called the SML

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,710
crate for space kit so we pioneered that

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,620
hardware I'm guessing some of you've

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,390
probably heard a bit heard of it before

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,790
it's a universal invention programming

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,260
platform powered by Raspberry Pi

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,600
we like the Raspberry Pi because it's a

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,630
self-contained system it's like a

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,700
turbocharged BBC micro or sense hat for

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,700
a Raspberry Pi so far we're in 50-plus

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,250
schools and sold 60 plus kits which is

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,540
great and that's just the beginning

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,250
just to give you a bit of a background

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,050
with sort of sensing that you can do you

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,530
got accelerometers for your acceleration

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,980
magnetometer magnetic fields compasses

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:51,600
gyroscopes for your angular velocity

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,210
temperatures self-explanatory camera

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,890
again self-explanatory you can detect

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,360
infrared light ambient light in

00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,640
different colors which is really cool

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,170
ultraviolet light for you know seeing

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,400
whether it's dangerous to go outside if

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,230
the Sun is going to be really crazier

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,260
than BAE or something pressure and

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,290
moisture which is also really handy this

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,710
is how it's set up it's just plugged in

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,900
and that's Lois my hand model so it says

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,610
keyboard mouse plastic if you want power

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,600
HDMI cable and you're a way to go you

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,080
just go straight to the desktop

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,930
interface this here is the master unit

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,670
that we designed which is space rated so

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,190
this thing takes all the students

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,540
experiments collaborate yeah smooshes

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,990
them all together and runs them

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,470
sequentially in space now okay that's

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,180
sweet

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,480
we've come up with this concept we've

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,880
got kids in schools what now well as we

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,770
heard in the introduction what's really

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,270
really cool is that we're powering the

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,190
first all-australian payload to the

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,160
International Space Station with these

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,440
cool experiments on board so this thing

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:58,860
is on its way to the space station in

00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:01,770
November and yeah it's something that

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,660
we're pretty proud of but what I'm most

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,310
proud of above everything is that

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,790
everything that we've done all the

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,860
assembly all the all the manufacturing

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,110
of like the units themselves the

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,510
programming the our design everything

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,570
it's all done here ooh in Australia like

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,980
and that's something

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:26,230
you don't typically see with your

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:27,550
hardware so right let's talk about

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,570
Python because that's what we're here

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,070
for what makes them exciting for kids

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,280
the thing is is that like we need more

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:38,890
kids in stem how kids like eventually

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,740
will be able to feed back into like our

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:45,490
economies and help our planet is is

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,460
really vital to to making stem important

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,160
and relevant so how do we inspire them

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,080
well when it comes to your programming

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,450
and your experimentation you really got

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,070
to see it in action so as we've heard

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,410
many times before your textbook

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,130
education and following distinct methods

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,690
is you know like a bit boring you want

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,190
to untether them you kind of want to

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,840
give them problems instead and just let

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,880
them figure it out but at the same time

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,550
students these days they have massive

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,200
schedules so like you've got to make

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,090
sure that it's relevant so they can just

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,250
be clipped into your existing curriculum

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,470
and they can just use it as a tool for

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,150
everyday stuff just an off-the-shelf

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,180
sort of thing that can be in a science

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,070
environment you don't want to tear them

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,210
away with like if the next big thing

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,000
you're just got to keep it really

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,820
relative relevant to what's going on and

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you also got a let them be creative and

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,980
I'll add to that later so the problem is

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,540
that sure we've got this really great

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,000
you know tool but low level programming

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:49,380
of sensors is crazy like you're gonna

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,490
spend hours and hours actually you know

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,810
programming to gain access to these

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,270
sensors a lot of the time they're

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,760
proprietary it's not easy a lot of kids

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,410
don't want to do it and the thing is is

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,030
that if you've got such a awesome

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,250
out-of-the-box programming environment

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,850
you don't want to stop people like from

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,710
actually using it so from the student

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,210
engagement perspective the thing is that

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,920
kids aren't interested in writing sensor

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,930
interface code like I said there's a

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,990
little time in the curriculum like I

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,060
said and in order to improve the student

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,370
experience we needed to do something

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,290
about it now just as an example of what

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,370
we're talking about this is a standard

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,410
library that is necessary to get a

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,620
single accelerometer working straight

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,100
out of the box and the thing is is that

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,680
kids don't

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,930
to program something this long just to

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,520
get an X Y or Z value I know I don't so

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:46,150
but the thing is we had to do something

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,660
about it so our solution was to actually

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,430
make a hardware API for students that is

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,320
applicable for both the hardware for the

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,500
for the high school and university level

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,660
so an application programming interface

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,150
API they exist to make our lives easier

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,350
and in the case of Education we want to

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,510
make it easy for kids to be able to

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,120
write just a few fundamental lines of

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,280
code and get instant gratification

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,960
because that's that's the thing like if

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,950
they don't see results straight away

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,650
they're going to get bored with the

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,630
thing and the thing is is that you know

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,390
if you're going to be losing hours and

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,190
hours to a single sensor to get a single

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,050
value then they're not gonna they're

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,370
just going to ditch it especially and

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,160
the thing is is that normal

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,780
out-of-the-box programming like if

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,820
you're going to be doing addition or

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,200
print statements and things like that

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,760
it doesn't put you into the real world

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,590
and that's what we kind of wanted to do

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,270
because if it's relevant then they'll

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:43,180
learn so a tricky one little bit of a

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,400
disclaimer you can't use the a of this

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,500
API that we've been like trying to work

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,810
towards with that basic programming

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,390
skill like I put this in here because

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,760
like you do kind of need to know your

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,570
very basic stuff like your loops and

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,160
things and to that I say there's a lot

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,080
of talent out there that teaches it croc

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,390
learning is probably the one that I love

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,740
the most it's just you go there you do a

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,290
few courses and you'll be able to use

00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,910
this API out of the box there's not much

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,510
you need to do it's just what we're

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,740
trying to yeah to get at all right so

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,930
then you give them a universal then you

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,460
give the students a universal device to

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,330
let them explore the physical world I'm

00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:24,130
talking of course about the SML kit and

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:27,640
the thing is is that like you really

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,230
want like the hardware is only ever

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,720
going to be as good as the software so

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,840
the reality is that a device like this

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,880
it could be a brand new set of eyes for

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,530
a student and it helps them see the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,530
world in ways that they've never seen

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,900
before and there's endless experiments

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,850
to be done in classrooms today that

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,380
don't really you know put things into

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,149
perspective

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,799
and like I said earlier that instant

00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,970
feedback instant gratification of what's

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,470
happening in the real world is really

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,779
really important if it takes forever to

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,779
get to it you're not gonna learn it this

00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:02,500
is two happy kids me and Louis enjoying

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,669
the API it gets us outside and I can

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,490
tell you now like I said we really

00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:08,769
didn't want to deal with a 20-page API

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,419
to do basic testing of our own space

00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,429
grade hardware because often we want to

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,889
test sensors and we just want to be able

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:18,580
to just dive into an API to get things

00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:22,330
done here's a real-life application a

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,460
balloon flight so this cube here was

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,039
actually flown to the stratosphere last

00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,720
week we launched it from tomorrow we

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,419
wanted to test the power of the API so

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,309
what we did was we loaded it into a

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,649
weather balloon and a young intern was

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,740
tasked with using the bare-bones API in

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:42,970
such a way that students would you know

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:46,769
basically gain used the most fundamental

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:49,419
level of Python and use the API to

00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:52,690
actually solve a problem problem being

00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:54,820
they wanted to actually see the rapid

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,279
changes in humidity until the user what

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,259
altitude that you know event occurred

00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,269
and it could be done with a few handfuls

00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:03,309
of lines so these are some photos of

00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:04,539
course of the balloon launch this is

00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,190
some of the data that the API pulled

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,340
very simply over to one four five lines

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,750
and of course they were able to apply

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:17,529
their math and detect and log to a file

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:20,440
exactly when that that those events

00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:22,179
happen those humidity changes happen one

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,250
thing that we're doing with our API is

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,460
because it exists self-sustained we're

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,350
trying to crank up how fast we can log

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,600
data cuz logging data is really quickly

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,730
is the key to getting really smooth

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,789
plots and not having like janky lines

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:39,610
everywhere so we're at the moment at 25

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,889
Hertz and you can push it up to 400

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,389
Hertz which means that you can get a lot

00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,970
of data and you can do really really

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,190
interesting things with it without like

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,289
a lot of distortion so how does it work

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,230
because I'm kind of like waffling here

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:55,570
right really simply put what we're

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,700
calling it is the obelisk abstraction

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,840
engine so we have this hardware engine

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,770
that sits in the middle

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,340
of your Python script which since be run

00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,840
from standard IDE and the hardware it

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,120
does all the serious number crunching

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,800
the data translation from your sensors

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,040
and we've optimized it as a binary

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,900
system that runs by itself there's a lot

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,760
of work that's gone into it to making

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,580
sure that you gets data as fast as

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,670
possible from the sensors so that you

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,560
can push the system and we're trying to

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,790
make it compatible with a huge amount of

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,290
sensors so it can just be a

00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,990
plug-and-play thing for heaps of

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,190
different you know hardware applications

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,560
and from here you just have a really

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,810
really simple library Python file you

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,490
just import it and you make function

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,780
calls from within your program it

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,710
connects to the engine and the magic

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,000
happens with that blue smoke right so

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,070
we've made it really really simple so

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,120
students can use it in classrooms you

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:54,070
just implement it in this sense the

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,870
device that you're trying to use the

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,940
sensor that you're trying to pull data

00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,740
from and then you interrogate it and you

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,480
ask it specifically for that type of

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:07,030
information this is an example of

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,770
actually how to use it within a

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,020
classroom application so say that you

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,420
want to get gyroscopic data all you do

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,760
is you tell it the device name within

00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,190
your Python script you tell it what

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,200
sensor you're after and then the data

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,940
that you want then that feeds back into

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,830
the abstraction engine and it does

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,050
everything it can to make sure that you

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,540
get that data as fast as possible

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:32,050
instantly here's another one that we use

00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,470
all the time for our for our satellite

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,990
stuff

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,630
EPS electrical power system we want to

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,640
find out about current we talk to the

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,470
current sensor specifically current

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,750
sensor number one and then we ask it for

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,330
the current and as fast as it can our

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,220
system running in the background on the

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,520
microcontroller even will interrogate

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,780
that sensor and returner and this is how

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,130
to implement it and actually get

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,260
temperatures straight away and this is

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,630
getting it from an on-board computer you

00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,120
import the obelisk engine you connect to

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,620
it and you just you can dump the

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,630
information straight to a variable and

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,340
that's really really cool because it can

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,400
be used in it's a completely

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,050
self-sustained system

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,910
and we've made sure that the speed of

00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:16,500
the sensors is you know as as succinct

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,940
as possible like in imagine if kids were

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,980
programming each sensor like the

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,660
differences in speed that you'd get very

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,280
different card web platforms it'd just

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,990
be a nightmare

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,130
and it's flexible we can actually use it

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,750
with a whole bunch of language with

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,220
other languages too we're talking like

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,740
we can use it with scratch if you want

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,290
to so if kids young kids want to get

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,630
sensor data really easy we can port it

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,280
to heaps dare I say report it to Java as

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,530
well I don't know we can do all sorts of

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,450
stuff anyway so yeah you end up with

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,210
relevant and fun data it's live and

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,190
simple you got real science real

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,570
programming and your meat learning

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,700
outcomes because you can just get

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,530
straight in to just using it as an

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,200
extension to your existing learning

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,110
tools it's going to be really really

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:03,090
accurate and you can use it in games as

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:04,800
well so because it's live you get that

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,780
instant gratification when you use it in

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,760
a game environment an opportunity I can

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,230
probably use is you can use this atomic

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,110
like you can use it as like a Python

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,670
tamagotchi like digital pet code where

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,470
you need to take it outside into the Sun

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,790
for it to survive or something like that

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,140
you know like you can do all sorts of

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,150
fun stuff and that encourages that

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,070
creativity aspect because it's now so

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,070
simple to talk to the real world

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,620
and I think basically we've known for

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,660
years my last slide so we're known for a

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,520
long time that science teaching is

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,650
really only successful to practicals

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,240
right like no matter what you do if you

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,920
give a kid a textbook they're not just

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,050
going to learn everything like even

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,210
close to what they would if you did your

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,800
practical experiments so the thing is is

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,660
that with your technology engineering

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,510
and maths aspects of stem they're

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,190
integral to the big picture right but

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,080
we're still struggling to actually give

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,270
them like practical like relevancy in

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,580
the classroom and you got to take

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,890
inspiration from from what works and the

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,929
thing is because kids have traditionally

00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,580
loved like hands-on science experiments

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,679
we've tried to give a code base of an

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,870
engine that will let that science

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,620
practical sense be used with your maths

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,450
and and your programming as well so what

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,790
that means is yeah having the easily

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,410
programmable hardware now it allows you

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,990
to realize the same content

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:26,280
you know same concept in the technology

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:29,640
engineering math fields and just slipped

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,380
over again and the thing is is that it

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,380
will help them at the end of the day

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:43,740
just get a wider range of skills to

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:46,610
solve problems Thanks and you can scan

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,610
that to take you straight to our website

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:58,890
Thank You Anders and we have any

00:24:50,280 --> 00:25:01,080
questions this is fantastic we've been

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,120
struggling with the launch of a

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,650
high-altitude balloon for the last sort

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,590
of nine months and planned to launch

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,200
later this year we've got two competing

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:13,950
and conflicting goals though the first

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,540
is the actual programming of a system to

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,610
make use of that data and do something

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,730
interesting with it but alongside that

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,860
we have a mechatronics class who the

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,670
whole point is to sort of build and

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,990
operate really low-level to work off the

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,580
reading the data from registers and

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,380
things like that on our way so how would

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,540
something like this allow us to

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,490
potentially do both of those things so

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,050
that we can hit our goals in IT and the

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,610
mechatronics guys can still give

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,870
students that exposure to the low-level

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,760
stuff well the thing is you don't

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,590
actually like we don't rob you of the

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,290
low-level stuff at all so the thing is

00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:49,290
is that I feel like this is more of this

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,900
is more of a tool to get people to not

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,010
be discouraged at the very beginning so

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,540
the thing is that your mechatronics

00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,160
students can still dive in and use those

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,690
sensors directly we don't block them or

00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,160
anything the inner yeah the interface

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,410
engine just sits there and talks to it

00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,840
and just facilitates a really quick data

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,400
read so I think what it comes down to is

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,870
with your balloon launch and actually

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,750
getting data and stuff like that you

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,910
could have this abstraction engine

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,400
running non-stop on say a Raspberry Pi

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,210
like this where the balloon system runs

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,950
off a Raspberry Pi and at the same time

00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,300
you could have other experiments that

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,600
are running on your mechatronics which

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,280
try to potentially interrogate the

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,780
sensors in different ways see if they

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,500
can get more out of them sort of like an

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,790
optimization sort of thing but it seems

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,930
really cool are we

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,030
talking you guys a little bit more of a

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:45,060
nice couple of days well it is here

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:48,420
tonight so yeah yeah hi I've sort of got

00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:52,140
two questions first of all cost what are

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:54,480
we talking about if school wanted to for

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,480
the software engine or the hardware the

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,030
hard way or the hardware that was an old

00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,920
project okay and that was eleven hundred

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,080
dollars that included the flight to

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,400
space now we don't know anymore because

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,780
we're not that we weren't the ones that

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,320
were directly selling it we're on

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,300
selling it to another provider so yeah

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,880
like I'm not too sure so it is it is

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,400
pricey from the perspective of just a

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,990
raw hardware platform right but yeah the

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,270
idea was is that that cost actually

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,470
incorporated funding a rocket launch

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:28,950
which are hundreds of thousands of

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:31,770
dollars you know so yeah okay so but you

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:34,890
were talking about some of these are

00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:38,700
going up on the ISS this one one master

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:42,930
just one is going up yeah so in terms of

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:47,850
getting students to get you know their

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:49,140
code experiments happening in space yes

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,030
that an option

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,480
yeah yeah that's the idea the idea was

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:56,430
that the schools would develop on their

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,170
own platform so get the kit and they

00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,540
play around understand how it works and

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,760
then they start programming it and then

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,840
they'd come up with their own little

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,690
self-contained code block and that would

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,180
be sent in and it would be integrated

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,500
into like a one big stack of experiments

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,960
that run one after the other

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,370
so yeah the schools get the opportunity

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,220
to run their own experiments in space

00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,290
yeah great okay so when you say they

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,760
need to get a kid yes that's that

00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:25,350
azimoff yes yes the cost of that I was

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,780
bundled with a flight cost like I said

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,910
so it was just an 1100 that would that

00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,980
was what it was originally going for so

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,260
yeah that included the hardware and the

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,460
and the mission it was like all in one

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,170
sort of thing yeah right so I'm still

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,550
not sure if is there's an opportunity

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,610
for students just like this now not

00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,780
through us

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:51,730
not like yeah okay thanks that's

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,910
actually cute brighter that's doing the

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,940
thing and so yeah so where the hardware

00:28:54,910 --> 00:29:00,220
dudes and yeah so we worked on all the

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,410
hardware platforms and then basically

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,060
queue Brad took over from there and did

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,590
all the distribution to school so like I

00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,390
said originally cost was eleven hundred

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,090
we don't know what the retail price is

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,680
now but it incorporates everything yeah

00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,450
so that would kind of feed into my

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,690
question whether like if people wanted

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:20,620
to use this for weather balloon type

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:22,300
experiments I would like to I would say

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,630
stay tuned

00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:29,140
we like the the hardware PR has really

00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:32,470
shown us fantastic ways to get people

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,810
more involved in actually doing like the

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,450
experimentation and getting into into

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,160
your code far better and we've heard a

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,120
lot that the hardware platform itself

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,090
should be just something that's

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,820
available as a general like similar to

00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:49,660
an Arduino so yeah like that's

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:56,700
definitely something future potentially

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,700
yeah any other questions

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,460
yes I'm I see that your customer or your

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,100
target is educational system and

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:13,540
probably high school network year travel

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:17,490
yeah and students from probably one to

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,020
the final year I see that there's three

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,800
sensors there with accelerometer

00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:28,030
gyroscope and metal meter what are they

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:31,900
for for educational purpose or it just

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,300
oh yeah absolutely yeah so the the so

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,820
the the nine axis I am you which has the

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,860
accelerometer magnetometer jaresko they

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,780
can use those in all sorts of practical

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,050
applications and like being able to read

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,570
them directly in this regard it means

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,570
you can write a simple program like like

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,100
similar to like a little ball maze and

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,840
the accelerometer will help you guide

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,460
the ball through the maze and the

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,670
magnetometer you could use it in a

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,650
classroom using graphing libraries that

00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,920
we've seen talk to

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,420
earlier today to make like a compass for

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,490
example that's based off the magnetic

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,960
readings that you read around and then

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:12,150
your gyroscope because you see how

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,800
violently you're tilting the device and

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,080
and get feedback on that so you can do

00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,360
all that like within within a classroom

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,070
I can think of it the accelerometer as

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,350
far as like a scientific experiment goes

00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,870
you could definitely use it as a Newton

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,090
meter or something as well that's got

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,700
its applications there so yeah it can be

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,940
relevant I tell you like the target

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:37,820
market was from years nine to ten hmm so

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:40,350
yeah and I see that there's the kind of

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,770
communication link there for us me and

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:46,320
do you have wireless well a lot the

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,800
system doesn't have wireless yeah that

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,810
would be great

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:55,400
that would be good next version probably

00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:57,630
okay yep okay there's no more questions

00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,650
wrap that up there thank you very much

00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,210
inert yeah

00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,850
we're working on some pretty awesome

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,050
stuff as well before yes so working on

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,210
some new stuff as well as part of this

00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,410
API there's a lot more hardware and

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,960
stuff that we're getting involved in

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,520
because your space stuff is cool but we

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,740
feel that stem is even cooler

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,150
so yeah just keep your eyes peeled for

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,540
other really really cool stuff with

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,010
regards to you know the getting more

00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,190
involved with your hardware in

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:25,700
classrooms and universities yeah thank

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,700
