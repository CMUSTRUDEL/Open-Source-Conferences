Minecraft is one of the best selling video games of all time. So, why not use it as a tool for teaching Python?

Instead of clicking to place blocks, students can create giant shapes, structures or even games within the game by learning some basic Python code - and along the way, key programming concepts. 

This presentation will cover how it works, and what you need to set this up for school or home. We'll look at examples of coding projects, how it can relate to other subjects in the curriculum (such as maths and design), and discuss why this is a great tool for introducing beginners to text-based coding.

No prior knowledge required, although some familiarity with the Minecraft game and/ or text-based coding will be useful.

Recommended for teachers or parents of students in Years 5 - 12 who are at a beginner or intermediate stage of learning programming.  Budding young coders also welcome!

um my pleasure to introduce digital Kay

00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,710
she's worked as a media and Technology

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,030
educator for over a decade at museums

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,790
universities in the New South Wales

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,950
schools with the aim of empowering young

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,740
people to be creators and not just

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,480
consumers of all things digital she also

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,650
runs a range of coding and electronics

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,650
workshops for teachers and adults

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,750
tailored to their needs and today she's

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:32,989
going to be talking to us about Python

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:37,200
and minecraft okay hello can you hear me

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:40,950
okay hi so my name is Kiki but I call

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,739
myself digital ko I'm and I want to talk

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,719
to you about using Python to blow stuff

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:52,340
up specifically I want to touch on the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,829
point that Bruce was raising about

00:00:52,340 --> 00:01:00,449
introductory programming sometimes seen

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:04,890
as being boring uninteresting why do we

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:08,150
have to learn this miss and I want to

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,350
use Python to get kids excited about

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:16,830
programming the hook to get our students

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,770
into understanding programming concepts

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,799
and give them something tangible and fun

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,549
that they can immediately apply those

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,770
skills to and I think one of the answers

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:36,299
is using minecraft so I might just get a

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:41,820
quick hands up as to who's already

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,509
teaching some kind of coding okay and

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,950
keep your hand up if you're using Python

00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,770
alright so quite a few people who's

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,890
anyone using other languages so there's

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,860
anyone using scratch okay a few people

00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:02,070
so I think that this is a really good

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,930
introduction to text based learning when

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,090
you're first starting out were you

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,020
coming from something like a visual

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,980
programming language like scratch or if

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:17,970
you just having a go with getting into

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,360
learning coding so I'm recommending this

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,430
for students who are telling you to

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,130
coding or if they've had a little bit of

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,230
experience with some text play

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,610
scourgings so talking about kids in

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:37,110
stages 3 and up I've been using this in

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,520
museums and after-school coding classes

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:44,520
and also with some years 7 & 8 so is

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:49,400
anyone actually used minecraft in the

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:53,660
classroom yep one or two people ok

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:57,030
who's familiar with the Minecraft game

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,970
ok most of you okay well your students

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,070
definitely are even if they don't love

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,490
playing the game themselves they are

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,030
familiar with the game so this is where

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,350
I think getting kids excited about

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,780
coding with something that they're

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:18,630
already familiar with and that they like

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:23,910
to do is a real hook for getting kids

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:26,160
engaged with text-based coding minecraft

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,030
licenses many of your students will

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,070
already have a minecraft account so if

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,459
that's the case that there's no

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,310
additional charge otherwise it's not too

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,900
expensive to get some minecraft edu

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:47,450
licenses for your class so relatively

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,040
low cost set up and I think there's less

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,940
involved than setting up something like

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,030
pygame for doing you know if you want to

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,690
do games and graphics and it's pretty

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,420
easy to see the immediate results from

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,940
your code okay

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,910
the other advantage is that most of

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,620
students who are using minecraft have

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:18,060
already had a bit of a feel for using

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,640
the command line okay so things if

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,890
you've played the PC or the Mac version

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,810
of minecraft students are probably

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,840
already familiar with doing things like

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,390
changing the web

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,170
setting the time sending your friend the

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,870
request to teleport to them some kids

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,540
might able to write of also use the

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,670
command blocks in the game or maybe even

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,920
set up their own simple server so

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,890
actually modifying the game further does

00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,100
require some more advanced coding using

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,510
Java which is a barrier for a lot of

00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,660
kids to get into but what I'm going to

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,230
show you is using an application

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,400
programming interface that allows you to

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,640
do some extra things within the game

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,630
without modifying the source code so you

00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,490
set up a server on your own computer and

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,480
then you're importing some libraries of

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,910
pre-made code and using Python to send

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:32,060
commands to your server to make things

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:36,870
happen in the game okay so some examples

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:41,220
to place blocks in the game to move the

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,840
player around and to check whether or

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,180
not a block has been hit and that's

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,320
useful if you want to sort of make some

00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,150
games so what else can you do with it

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,370
normally in the game for anyone who

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,240
doesn't know you're running around and

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,070
placing blocks sort of with your hands

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,750
to make stuff so it's a bit like virtual

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:06,510
Lego with Python you can build things

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,450
with code that would take ages to

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,130
complete if you were just simply placing

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:17,370
every single block with your hands and

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,180
you can build faster you can build the

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,410
kinds of structures that would be

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,980
incredibly difficult or time-consuming

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,980
to make in games such as these spheres

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,040
you can duplicate your code so you can

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,570
design a building and replicate that

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,790
multiple times creating a whole city you

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:42,330
can get blocks to change color

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:46,980
and you can also create games within the

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:49,200
game of Minecraft so almost all of the

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,960
kids that I've been teaching this to

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,380
when we they first log into the game

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,510
they start running around and placing

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,910
and destroying blocks like they're used

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,530
to doing and having fun with that but as

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,310
soon as they see what they can do with a

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,160
code they get hooked and they go oh my

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,920
god I want to build this you know I want

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,860
to try making this kind of amazing

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,960
structure and they get hooked on

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,320
understanding what they can do with the

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:23,160
coding okay so let's look at what you

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,400
need is two options first of all does

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,280
anyone here got a Raspberry Pi yeah a

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,710
few heads up okay so if you've got the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,200
Raspberry Pi the minecraft PI Edition

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,390
comes pre-loaded on the Raspberry Pi so

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,480
there's nothing extra to buy but you

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:48,530
will need to of course hook your PI up

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,530
to a keyboard and monitor and a mouse so

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:56,130
the and if you've got a PI there's some

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,360
other cool things that you can do such

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,460
as sending a signal to the PI camera

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,310
which you might talk about later so if

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,500
you don't have a Raspberry Pi what you

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:12,720
can do now is you can just use a normal

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,660
PC or Mac but you'll need to buy a copy

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,270
of Minecraft so per computer or

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,160
minecraft edu which is the same thing

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,230
and then you can download for free this

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,390
raspberry juice plug-in I'll show you

00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,850
the website at the end where you can get

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,090
that and it comes with the server

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:36,540
software and all the API libraries that

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,960
you're going to need to use your code to

00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:42,330
talk to your minecraft server now just

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,970
note that both of these with the API

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,520
libraries that motion are initially

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:50,040
developed a design to work with Python

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,579
to I have

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,250
heard of people making their own library

00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:58,380
copies for it to work with Python 3 but

00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,839
there's not much support for that and

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,730
all of the teaching that I've been doing

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,829
with it and the version that you can get

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:12,209
off the website is all for Python 2 ok

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:15,269
so how it works is you get the libraries

00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,610
you import them into your Python code

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:22,769
you're sending a signal to the server

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:25,529
and then that tells you know the server

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:31,050
what to do to make things happen in the

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:33,720
game generally each computer will be

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,579
running its own like mini server so

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,209
you're running your own commands in your

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,910
own world on your own computer there is

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:45,930
an option for doing it in multiplayer

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,810
however I've used that quite a few times

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,579
at the Powerhouse Museum where I've run

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,709
these kind of workshops over a whole day

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,350
and personally I find it a bit

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,269
distracting having a lot of the kids in

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,639
multiplayer because somebody will make a

00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,620
wonderful structure somebody else will

00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:05,279
then come and place larvae all over it

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,550
and you know you get all those issues of

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,850
sort of conflict or cooperation which

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,949
you would have to deal with any kind of

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,199
multiplayer environment so if you're

00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:18,690
focused on the building you may want to

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,519
just simply get kids started off on

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,350
their own computers are in their own

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,690
little world all right so let's have a

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,600
look at a few examples of how it's going

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,500
to work and I'm going to demo here

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,120
setting it up

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,730
let's see good yep ok so I've got a

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,620
little folder here which is as I

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,310
mentioned something that I downloaded

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,980
for free from the internet from a

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,670
website called stuff about code which

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,339
I'll mention again at the end and that

00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:00,449
folder comes with a few basic things but

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:04,220
what I'm going to use here is a command

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:07,050
to start a server

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:11,550
so I'm just gonna get a little service

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:13,889
started using canary mod if anyone's

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,319
familiar with that and I can just

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,619
minimize that I don't need to worry

00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:21,499
about that anymore

00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:24,689
alright then I've got minecraft here I'm

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:28,949
actually clicking on multiplayer but I'm

00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:35,089
just going to commit straightaway to my

00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:37,410
server okay so there we are in the world

00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:42,439
if you can see in the distance something

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:47,459
that I built a little while ago okay so

00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:50,160
what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:52,139
actually going to open up some files

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,879
that I've made earlier so I've just

00:11:52,139 --> 00:12:01,790
stored these in a folder and we'll start

00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:04,439
off with some very basics and just to

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,769
sort of give you some context usually

00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:11,490
what I would do when I was teaching when

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:16,589
I'm teaching this is I actually get kids

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,779
to sorry I'll just move this over into

00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:23,009
the screen over the other screen so you

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:27,079
can see it I to get kids to get a little

00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:31,110
bit familiar with the Python environment

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:36,470
first before we go into Minecraft so I

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:40,259
might show them how to open up idle how

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,230
you run things with the shell and how to

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:48,689
use a print statement once we've got

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:52,559
that far we can grab these libraries so

00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:54,600
we're importing some libraries for the

00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,459
Minecraft commands and also the blocks

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,329
that we're going to use and I've also

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:03,240
imported higher module there and created

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:08,429
a connection to the game so this very

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,589
first command that I'm going to run well

00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,589
simply is you know suppose so it's

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,329
basically like print statement but we're

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,689
going to be running it in the game

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:21,929
so that's supposed to chat and if I just

00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:28,170
put this to the side there we should be

00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:32,689
able to run this bit of code and then go

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:37,619
back to the game and see our message

00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:41,429
appear in the game okay so once we've

00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:47,239
done that let's have a look at actually

00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:50,759
doing some building so I might go into

00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:54,149
now a few research files and let's have

00:13:50,759 --> 00:14:02,339
a look at okay once again I'll just drag

00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:07,949
this over okay so now as you can see

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:12,269
I've created a variable to store my

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:14,249
player position and then I'm using once

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,429
again this comes from the libraries of

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:21,779
code that Mojang developed some years

00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:23,819
ago now and that's allowing me to set a

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,209
location for where I want to place a

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:32,249
block and deciding what kind of block

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:35,100
that I want to place and then what I'm

00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:37,589
going to do is so once I've got the kids

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:40,649
familiar with how it works and how we

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:43,649
can place one block we start learning

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:49,459
about loops and I've got to follow up

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:53,639
here where I can change one parameter of

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:59,369
my location so I can build a line of

00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:01,049
blocks let's just get this minimized a

00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:05,279
little bit usually when I'm working with

00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:09,259
this I'd have that window open at the

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:13,529
same time as I've got minecraft running

00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:17,489
so I can run my code go back to the game

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:22,429
there's my first block and there we see

00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:22,429
a line of blocks appearing

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,440
okay maybe one more quick example of the

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,690
same sort of thing so as we're doing it

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,970
a bit gradually building on their

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,660
knowledge okay with my place to block

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:40,089
we've placed a line of blocks how can we

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,339
work out how we can perhaps make a wall

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,589
of blocks and this is where kids start

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:47,139
thinking we start talking about maybe

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:51,779
making nested loops we stop talking

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:55,420
about coordinates and how you could

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,820
think about the maths involved of where

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:06,880
you want your blocks to be placed and

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:11,440
how to change your code okay so in this

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,589
case once again I've got a block that

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,089
I'm placing in front of my player and

00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:19,540
I'm using nested loops

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:24,300
this time to not just build a cross but

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:28,839
to build up okay thanks so whoops Oh

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:34,839
minimize that okay so that's disappeared

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:38,230
I was going to show you building a wall

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,300
of TNT and then of course what kids like

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,279
to do is to get the flint and steel and

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,220
blow everything up I'm just gonna be

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,680
careful not to have too many blocks

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:54,459
blowing up at once because it can crush

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,660
your server so if we go back to I'll

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:04,179
just give you a couple more quick

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:09,929
examples so in this case I've created a

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:13,270
whole tower again just using loops and

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,640
as you can see I've made a whole

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,459
structure there this is the sort of

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,699
thing that kids start working out ah

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,740
okay what else can I do with this what

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:28,660
else could I make and I could run my

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:32,950
code multiple times and without changing

00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:35,799
very much create a whole city so there

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,060
we go we've got two office blocks and if

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,250
you

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:46,350
see very closely and if I randomized

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,370
carpet on the floor okay here's another

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:57,840
example

00:17:47,370 --> 00:18:00,900
whoops I've gone too far okay we're over

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,430
this one actually created a little game

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:09,330
and this one's using we create a

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:13,250
function to determine the distance

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:20,040
between a player and a hidden block and

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:21,420
we're using time to calculate how long

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,940
it's going to take for the player to

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,950
find the block and we're sending to me

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,440
gathering some information about where

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,950
the player is and then sending messages

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:35,880
to see where the player needs to move

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:40,380
which way colder or warmer to go and

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:45,240
find the hidden block so as you can see

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,720
you can make games within the game all

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,210
right

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,030
so let's have a talk about what else we

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,870
can use it for so as I mentioned

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:57,450
learning about coordinates

00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:00,720
multiplication time as I just showed you

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,600
in the game you can actually import CSV

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,430
data files so if you wanted to make

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:13,680
something like a maze you could do that

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:17,760
with some data as we see here making

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,020
spheres is a one of the things kids love

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,430
to do because that would be very

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,230
difficult to actually make in the game I

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,570
made a map of New South Wales

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:31,800
unfortunately I didn't get to make quite

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:35,010
a Victoria yet so we can make artworks

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,680
with it and you can play around with

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,130
that wonderful you know cross between

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:47,930
maths and art and learn about patterns

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:50,229
and shapes and using perhaps you know

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:54,629
trigonometry

00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:57,070
you could look at things like geofencing

00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:59,320
and if you move out of a certain area

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,419
here to get a certain message you can

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,929
make a game to start charging people

00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:07,570
rent when they're in a space you could

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:14,169
talk create a game where your oxygen

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:16,089
decreases as you get higher up and if

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,219
you want to extend it further you can

00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,709
actually connect it to some external

00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:25,659
devices so this is an example of

00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:28,599
connecting a small Arduino with a little

00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:33,389
button to be able to trigger something

00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:37,539
to happen in the game so push the button

00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:43,779
and that's sending a signal to the

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:45,329
server we get a countdown and I think

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:50,259
you know it's going to happen

00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:53,139
alright so that's another favorite okay

00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:56,339
let's have a look at where else to get

00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:59,459
some information so the Raspberry Pi

00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:02,529
website has got some really fantastic

00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:04,649
resources there about getting started

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,929
with Minecraft PI's I mentioned

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:11,379
raspberry pecan pie the raspberry pies

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:14,589
come pre-loaded with the Minecraft pie

00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:17,409
in all the libraries that you need this

00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:19,719
is the website so if you want to go and

00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:23,489
get a download of the raspberry juice

00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:26,589
plugin for using on a PC or a Mac and

00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:28,809
there's a fantastic book that this

00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,879
fellow called Martin O'Hanlon who lives

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:32,829
in the UK is a bit of an expert on this

00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:34,839
if anyone wants to come and grab you

00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:37,509
some time and have a look through this

00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,389
book and see some examples of the kinds

00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:44,739
of projects that you can make in here

00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:47,440
for instance they've got our project on

00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:49,509
building a 3d block printer which I

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,539
haven't tried myself but there's some

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:55,629
really fantastic projects here getting a

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,489
working analog clock to happen for

00:21:55,629 --> 00:22:00,909
instance for instance it's a really

00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:03,100
fantastic projects that has showcased on

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:07,830
that website

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,210
okay so I encourage you to try it out

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,190
it's not too hard and if you don't know

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:17,679
that much about Minecraft don't worry

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:25,919
your students will okay so thanks if

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:28,960
anyone wants to ask any questions

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:39,490
yep I'll run the mic out to anyone that

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:42,909
has questions so you're working with

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,480
museums yes I work at the Powerhouse

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:48,610
Museum just as a casual but I also do

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,270
after-school coding workshops and I do

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,780
incursians so we use and working with

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,090
with museum doing projects with students

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,919
usually what we have is more often

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,049
either school groups come in on

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,510
excursion or we have rerun school

00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:07,659
holiday workshops so students will come

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:10,919
in for like a whole day or maybe two

00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,510
days and we'll teach them some basics of

00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,130
Python and we teach them how to use it

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:21,190
in the game and they maybe build their

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:23,440
own game within the game I was thinking

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,710
how do you integrate you know things

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,190
from the museum history or whatever that

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:33,070
is then related that they can actually

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:35,380
project into a Minecraft oh absolutely

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:38,080
well we also just run minecraft building

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,390
sessions there and sometimes we tie-in

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,490
with exhibitions that are going on in

00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,700
the museum so the kids will depending on

00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,620
whatever the theme is you know if it's

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,419
something to do with the pyramids or

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,270
whatever they can be building those

00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:54,250
types of things within the game for sure

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,789
yeah I mean you can create any kind of

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,730
structure within the game given time but

00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:02,409
the great thing about being able to use

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,990
coding with the game is being able to

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,700
work out the maths to make things happen

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,210
much more quickly than you could do

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,210
manually

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:20,660
up the back anyone else is there

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,090
anything available for doing anything

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,070
like this for Minecraft PE on iPad

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,740
because there used to be pocket mind a

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,160
pocket mines now at a date so the

00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,690
clients don't work anymore unfortunately

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,170
not that I'm aware of

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,810
yeah so though libraries have code that

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:41,600
were created were initially created for

00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:45,470
the Raspberry Pi edition and they have

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,290
yeah that people have made it for the PC

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,750
Edition but I don't know that anyone's

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:59,500
even talked about making it for Pocket

00:24:50,750 --> 00:25:01,220
Edition a related question I guess so

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,030
obviously a lot of your students are

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,560
going to come in and they're going to be

00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,720
enthusiastic minecraft players already

00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,120
yeah do you find that the the fully

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,890
fledged PC version is an easier sell for

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,030
them than the Raspberry Pi version do

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,200
they feel disappointed when they sit

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:17,690
down at the PI version and they don't

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:20,480
have ocelots yes I certainly have found

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,440
that when I've used the Raspberry Pi

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,320
edition at first but when the focus is

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,180
on the building it doesn't really matter

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,250
and yet they're in fact in the Raspberry

00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,400
Pi edition there's less building blocks

00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:37,130
as well what I was just showing you in

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,070
the game was actually on Minecraft 1.8

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,170
so it's not one point ten which is the

00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,620
very latest version but it's close

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,630
enough so that you know there's a lot of

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,320
variety and what you can do with the PC

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:53,030
Edition whereas in Pocket Edition and in

00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,270
the Raspberry Pi edition yeah there's

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,800
less box you can make but still like the

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,740
amount of stuff that you can do with the

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,630
code and which is really our focus right

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:07,670
is sufficient to get kids engaged even

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,150
with is real if you can get them there

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,620
yeah so like I said like pretty much all

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,780
of the kids because they know the game

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,450
already and they love the game when you

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,420
first introduced doing this to them

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,460
they'll start playing the game like

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,350
normal but if you can show that what you

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,480
can accomplish with code

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,750
me that's the hook that's where I get

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,110
the are ha moment and it's like ah what

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,150
else can I do I want to know now I have

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,740
to make this happen and how to work at

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,539
it and they have to try and do some

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,390
problem solving and work out the maths

00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,740
and you know think about how they're

00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:49,470
going to make something happen multiple

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:51,330
times yeah thanks for that it fully

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,429
inspired me to do some work like this

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,539
with my work experience students I'd

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:56,789
like to better do it in a web browser

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,900
and I sort of had a similar question

00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,630
about Pocket Edition because all the

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,659
students will arrive with iPads I wonder

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,130
whether in a web browser-based VNC

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,950
session or something might be an option

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:10,409
if the Pocket Edition doesn't support it

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,000
yeah I'm not sure again that would be up

00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:14,850
to someone I guess for the Python

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,730
community to try and write some

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,530
libraries that would work for that at

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,480
the moment the libraries that have been

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,409
written to only work with the raspberry

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:35,850
pi Edition or just the normal PC or Mac

00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:37,320
version any further questions I'm gonna

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,900
break many rules here because people say

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,549
you're only allowed to ask questions for

00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,230
response to the person up there David

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,190
Beasley is currently started writing a

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,809
minecraft server we're using async i/o

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,440
so hopefully he goes a long way with

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,440
that because that could be very

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,919
interesting for us oh that will be

00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,960
interesting one more not a question

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,970
there's there's a bucket plugin which

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,700
might be useful it's called computer

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:10,020
craft so it's it's Lua rather than

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:15,470
Python but it adds computer terminals

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,470
and little turtles to Minecraft okay

00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,110
talked about this elsewhere so that's

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:26,039
actually now part of Minecraft age you

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:29,880
as well the computer craft mod so that's

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:33,720
a mod that you can use in the game and

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,540
yes you using Lua programming language

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,450
to program some little turtles to go

00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,429
around and

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,139
you know make things happen in the game

00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:48,940
that's also a fantastic you know

00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:51,730
introduction to learning some coding and

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,519
I'll also mention again we have the bike

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,610
on a you slack channels if folks want to

00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,549
provide additional resources and discuss

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,210
talks after they're completed so thank

00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:04,769
you once again

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,769
